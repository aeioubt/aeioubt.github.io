      ᚼ and ᛡ look exactly the same. Are they like J, read differently
      in english and spanish? they're invariants of ᛆ and ᛃ and ᛄ and
      ᚺᚻᚽᛀᛂ. ᚾ and ᛀ are also recognized as different letters. wiki only
      gives ᛅ<br>
      <br>
      I wonder they don't have staveless ᚼᛡ but only its double form ᛝ
      which is ᛜ which is ᛄ or ᛳ when on staff. <font color="#cccccc">I
        take it all from wiki, don't rely on me more than necessary.<br>
      </font><br>
      Those ᛜs are double ᚲ which is "the 6th letter of all the runic
      alphabets" And it is also ᚴ so it surprised me that the one
      telling that <font color="#cccccc">(I gave the archive version of
        the article
        https://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Кеназ&amp;oldid=102219515
        which currently is there, so you can tell when I wrote it) </font>knew
      of bornholm alphabet. Because it is the 6th letter of that too. <br>

      And I compared ᛆᛒᚦ with ᛄᛓᚦ of fbthark, those&nbsp; ᛄᛓ are forem
      of ᛆᛒ but if ᚦ is third in both. Let's look at 9ths:<br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Futhark"><img
          src="4academia_files/futhark.png" alt="" border="0"
          width="1091" height="241"></a><br>
      <font color="#cccccc">Now I wonder what if Elder Futhark is a
        fabrication? Then it could also look like a later development of
        a previous system. I leave this thought hanging for now. I look
        at the 9ths:</font><br>
      It's I in Younger Futhark and И in Elder Futhark<font
        color="#cccccc"> (is it Elder as Elder's of Zion) I'm too
        cynical.</font><br>
      which are invariants today. Is it why first line needed to mention
      both staved and staveless forms? Because in Bornholm alphabet ᛁ is
      8th. Is it why they needed additional I's. In latin alphabte I is
      the 9th.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#00cccc">Why do aettir divide so weirldy in the image
        above?</font><br>
      <br>
      The following image shows where that Elder Futhark can be
      attested, it's Kylverstene<font color="#cccccc">n</font><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [f] u þ a r k g [w] h n i j p ï z s t b e m l ŋ
      d o<br>
      The way first letter actually look (even if by an incident) made
      me look at it as alphabetic record actually, and it's easier for
      me to see at ᚢ as an invariant of ᛒ because В is russian for V,
      which is an invariant of U, which is ᚢ<br>
      But why ᛆ is ᛁ? ain't every vowel ᛁ? ا, I and ו, the three main
      vowels all can be 1<br>
      ᚦ is on its place, and the next in futhark is literally a, and
      it's some weird form of it: ᚨ is it ゛'ed ᛁ? tittled <font
        color="#999999">is the new word I learnt, tittle is definitely
        little. t is tittled l. f is tittled ſ which make them closer to
        θ.</font><br>
      ᚨᚩᚪᚫᚬᚭ are invarinats, all A<br>
      The next one is complicated: ᚱ only reminds ᛒ and that's where
      symilarities end.<br>
      but the nex letter снова совпадает. Какие шансы того что это
      случайность, и мы пойдём дальше и встретим подобные совпадения ещё
      несколько раз. Но это могло быть и взаимовлияние систем письма,
      когда мем "ᚲ <font color="#cccccc">a</font>is the 6th rune"
      проявляется в обоих системах, закрепляясь там эдиктами.<br>
      and ᚷ is staveless ᚼ (both stand for h)<br>
      Why those reconstructers tryed to guess ᚹ where it stands ᛁ again
      in the same place as in bornholm.<br>
      But further I don't notice many coincidences, other than ᛈ around
      where P is in latin and ᛊᛏ just as ᛋᛏ in bornholm. and ᛉ is
      supposedly not M of ᛘ, but R<br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiz"><img

          src="4academia_files/Mannaz.png" alt="" border="0" width="495"
          height="450"></a><br>
      That ᛗ form of ᛘ I recognize as double ᛘ, but ᛙ form allows me to
      recognize it in another ᛁ at the 11th place of bornholm's ᛘ<br>
      and that letter ᛀ is recognized as N, once again in alphabet stave
      is double vertical (or did I see on this example? It's somewhere
      in my notebooks past collection42 or so) and once again L ~ N, ᛚ ~
      ᚿ<br>
      I don't know how they recognized&nbsp; in there, but ᛢ stands for
      kw, just as q I'd expect to see between p &amp; r<br>
      <br>
      So hence I claim that futhark is misrecognized alphabetic canon.
      Too many coincidences to be separated.<br>
      and the parade of coincidences goes on: <br>
      ᛒ after ᛏ just as ᚢ was both after ᛏ in bornholm alphabet and
      instead of ᛒ in this exact set. ᛏᛒ are also the two legendary
      first consonants.<br>
      ᛖᛗᛚᛜ is an additional line in abcd form of EMLNg, which could be
      that early form of I-row, which until the beginning of the second
      volume of this work was only reconstructed, but now I revisited
      that part and I tell it's the thing. <br>
      ᛞ is a double form of ᚦ and could be both ס and Z <font
        color="#cccccc">&amp; if that past-T line are Υ Φ Χ, then it's Ψ
        before </font>the omega of ᛟ. (X reminds ᛀ just as H(h) reminds
      Н[n], even more than h ~ n, and I mentioned that both L &amp; Ng
      can be hidden in that X, or only L, and Ng is Y, then ᛞ is Z, and
      ᛟ is &amp;)<br>
      <br>
      And before vowel ᛈ stands ᛃ which an be seen at as at a form of ᛆ
      <br>
      isnt it double Ar? J is two? ij? Y?<br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C4%93ran"><img
          src="4academia_files/Jera.png" alt="" border="0" width="566"
          height="452"></a><br>
      Form ᚼ<font color="#cccccc">ᛡ</font> tells that it's double ᛅ
      (just as ᚮ is double ᛆ, and ᚮ is the vowel which is in the head of
      that line)<br>
      Form ᛄ once again tells me that a ~ d, for d is <font
        color="#cccccc">Þ</font>þ which is ᚦ<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">SO I CLAIM HERE THAT FUTHARK IS ACTUALLY

      I said that ogham is the basic alphabet and runes are maybe older
      than latin, and here's why we shouldn't trust archaeology that
      much<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinichi_Fujimura"><font
          color="#000000">:</font></a> <br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">On October 23, 2000, Fujimura and his team
        announced that they had another finding at the Kamitakamori site
        near Tsukidate town. The finds were estimated to be 570,000
        years old.<br>
        <br>
        On November 5, 2000, the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun published
        pictures of Fujimura digging holes and burying the artifacts his
        team later found. The pictures had been taken one day before the
        finding was announced. Fujimura admitted his forgery in an
        interview with the newspaper.<br>
        <br>
        Fujimura confessed and apologized the same day in a press
        conference. He said that he had been "possessed by an
        uncontrollable urge".[1] He had planted the artifacts from his
        own collection in strata that would have indicated earlier
        dates. In Kamitakamori he had planted 61 of 65 artifacts, and
        had earlier planted all of the stonework in the Soshin Fudozaka
        site in Hokkaidō. He claimed that these were the only times he
        had planted artifacts.<br>
        <br>
        The Japanese Archaeological Association disaffiliated Fujimura
        from its members. A special investigation team of the
        Association revealed that almost all the artifacts which he had
        found were his fabrication. </font><br>
      <br>
      Though he was criticized before some true journalists did their
      job, so I wouldn't discard the field completely, but he wasn't
      disaffiliated for somewhat 25 years, and probably wouldn't be if
      he wasn't caught by the hand, so keep some healthy scepticism on
      what is considered true. <br>
      They didn't have videocameras centuries ago, so what anybody
      claimed can be irrelevant, for replication crisis goes all the way
      down the history.<font color="#cccccc"> Isn't history already
        thestory?</font><br>
      <br>
      <br>

      I was wondering why don't I see staveless ᛒ and here it is:<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      and here's another bonus, a daredevil claim that primitive forms
      of ogham are another evidence that it is the primary, the most
      primitive form of alphabetic writings. another to this one:<br>
      <br>
      I compared oghams between themselves, and figured out that
      initially there was only one and two, the bianry before one and
      zero. The binary which naturally grew out of unary numeral system,
      which is called in russian единичная, унарная, разная. И я сначала
      не понял почему разная? может равная? а, РАЗная! раз, раз, раз,
      разрубает, разделят пространство один раз или два. Этот тот дин,
      который одновременно и два <font color="#999999">(дин вместо

        Иберия is Sapain. and I stumbled across it before. And jews do
        look like spaniards or saqartvello which soulds italian, and
        those three could be of those 12 elbows, please don't hate me
        for uttering in, but to lighter colours you all look like the
        transitional group between us and the blacks you consider
        blacks. If we humans are all one group, we do have subgroups we
        distinguish between eachother whether we discriminate or not.</font><br>

      That discovery was made in my notebooks which I haven't scanned

        Dh = T? DM? m is t in russian cursive. It's confusing, but Ng as
        the primal form explains how labial (or is it nasal?) can

        And why I went there is I read at academia.edu that they found
        ogham-like writings on american continent (which is nothing
        special, for a chipped wolf walked from northern europe to
        greenland and canada by ice. He could be taken there by
        fraudsters, or the results can be forgered, for replication
        crisis and so on, but I think it's pretty much a consensus now
        that it happened, just like they figured out that people
        travelled the pacific ocean. I'm wasting my high for telling you
        mostly what I've already known, so I"m back to my notebooks.
        take care.</font><br>
      <br>
      If there were only ones and twos, and three of which, could they
      be on a dice? <br>
      Not very likely, more likely the 5 oghams were on them, and the
      sixth side was blank. Is it how Y became the 6th vowel? It's just
      a guess, or apossibility to гадать (guess, tell fortune)<br>
      <br>
      Ogham has many common feature with the rest of european alphabets:
      o is double a, as in runes and as in dannish orthography. Ogham
      seems to be the pole of the labials-first thing, only for whatever
      reason it puts labials in odd position and linguals in the even.
      The only explanation I can see to it so far is that they were
      recognized not as labial, but nasal; and not lingual but oral,
      thus nose was male for it's a shaft and mouth was female for it's
      a hole. and here could the contradictions of mama-deda take place,
      that could explain why maður stands for man.<font color="#cccccc">
        (inhaled some sacred smoke)</font> My thought probably led me
      this way because eves even and adams add is based in our flesh, in
      its' forms, where guys have 1 or 3 additional elements, which is
      more likely to be 1 for girls have lips - are they 2? 4? 6 with
      tits? I think it only tits count, for labia are behind the bush a
      guy also has, so it's like they just lack cock. so it's 1 for cock
      &amp; 2 for tits. систра. and... cook? cock, guard, gus, goose!

      and a third piece, just because it followed this one, and it ends
      in mentioning the site I edit it for, and it mentions the same
      stone, which I didn't notice before:<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      ꟷ tells that H is an invariant of I, which used to be in old
      russian orthography. a double I, Y, 𓇌<br>
      urprisingly Y became to sound as Й which is recognized as a
      shorter version of И.<br>
      as in boy. is it because the second one became shortened, and
      vowels are often swallowed in both text and speech.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Another important piece. I just found this image, and I was taught
      gotic, nobody knew it after such a teaching, and they gave us a
      later script, here I found it conceals runic script from 4th
      centurey a.d, which is often mentioned as the earliest period of
      runic inscriptions, and Tacitus witnessed that they used some
      divination with these letters<font color="#cccccc">, but now I
        don't even remember if he did or I reconstructed it volumes

      ᚢ is probably П (p) because if we compare ᚮ lines in bornholm and
      this one, we have to remove ᛣ and thus we have only ORSTU, where U
      is that very ᚢ which looks like П (which is how P look in russian,
