      The Astronomic pages.<br>
      First some gifs from the internets<font color="#cccccc">, mostly
        from https://acegif.com/gifs-the-solar-system/ but then I had to
        find a better mars, and the images of orbital excentricity and
        what comes after that are from some other sites. You should know
        how to find image by the image by reverse image search. </font>to


      inspire thought. They are mostly of the same motion system. And
      simply comparing them to see if they all agree or disagree on
      themselves I will see what is probably true<font color="#cccccc">
        (probably промямлил. т.е. неточная информация, не стопроцентно
        точная. может быть стопроцентно точной, но то что она точка не
        стопроцентно точно. (точка это точна скорей всего, на автомате
        писал) = this is a part of another work, and that work on
        language and it came to a decission to keep all the typos, and
        especially the random thought about anything referring to
        language, so don't be shocked. and don't read grey text if you
        are. for maybe they're a source of something interesting. And
        until I understood if they are random I keep on keeping them.<br>

      only they say Venus rotates the other way. So whether it's some
      stale misconception or this image is taken from the south on top,
      or that is just some coloured marble playing the role of Venus,
      who knows.<br>

      and some solar system gifs, the ones I went there for.<br>
      and the first one (actually it came the last) reminds me of
      musical notation, and I think again that musical
      notation-intonation was aligned to astrologic data. We would sing
      to communicate with the other planets? I doubt it works like this
      but who knows what acient knowledge have we lost. maybe those
      piramids positioning to Orion belt is not cherry-picking (I didn't
      check) we'll see if they knew after we rediscover the same
      technologies, to see how ancients could actually knew (double
      past. weird. runglish of a kind) how to sing to the priest at
      other planets. And so those prists would trasmit something too?
      Listen kid, that's weed. It's not good for you. <br>

      not only that one but all of them are not in up to scale (the
      planets are so small in comparison to the distances, that they
      would be much less than a pixel if the orbits were shown in one
      screen)<br>

      Here I see Spica (a star 250 light years away) and at first I
      thought it couldn't be right, it moves as if it is somewhere
      between mars and saturn. I thought it couldn't move that fast (or
      is there something I don't know) and I looked at it as at plane,
      and it seems to me it would move much slower if it was so far. It
      moves almost with the same speed saturn does, it cannot be real.
      But I think that I'm used to rotating finite disks in the static
      space, but here we move the space too. So I will return to this
      question I am rather puzzled o far. <br>

      The gif above probably has planets in scale to one another. The
      image bellow, definitely not.<br>
      The gif above is probably the only one keeping these ratios,
      because mars looks a little bigger than being a half of Venus in
      diametre. The distances are waaaaaaaaaay bigger. and to moons too.<br>
      <img src="astronomy_files/solar-system-2.gif" alt="" width="1600"
        height="229"><br>
      But that image is the only one so far, which shows planet properly
      rotating, (maybe because each of the градус (температурный связан
      с астрономическим) is one day and thus one rotation. It would be
      difficult to animate, but very possible, I will find slower years
      in gifs, or will have to make it by myself and with my friends to
      whom I will still have to pay some money for their work.) But hey!
      they rotate the other way: Their way sun would rise in the West.
      And Venus is indeed the only one with the one they didn't rotate
      at all, so they managed to make them all wrong. And it's a good
      thing, because I just look for reverse gif online and vois la!<br>

      Wow, does sun rotate? Naturally. I think The rotation of the sun
      is the main cause of our own rotation around the sun. And if we
      look from the north, we rotat counter-clockwise. And from our
      perspective it's not. I cannot visualize by this gif how could it
      happen that clock-wise became по-солонь (by sun) but I can
      visualize it without any gif: On the North sun is always at the
      southern half of the sky. It gets up at the East, raisese, moves
      to the West and falls down there. I f we look at the world with
      South in front of us. Face to the sun. Workers prefer sun lighting
      not in their eyes, but at the object they work with. Leasuring
      lazies prefer to face the sun. So let sun shine on you all the
      time. Be an actor. Actors work face to the light. Or be a worker,
      do the work. I will be aware of this attitutde and relation to the
      light among professionals. When you imagine west and east, you
      often look at the north in your mind, because that's how maps are
      made. To make the sun look in your back, to Make the Sun be on
      Your side. Blind your adversaries, not you.<br>

      Sometimes their scales puzzle me: they have placed so much effort
      into doing something beautiful only to make it misleading? The sun
      of the size of Earth. Why! Whatever, I will find the best one and
      will use it everywhere from then on.<br>

      (that uggo is also correct about ratios of mars and venus, but
      earth is almost as large as venus, a little bit larger than venus
      (both are 12 thousand kilometres in diametre: 12104 and 12742) but
      does it make it necessarily correct about the orbits. It is my
      first day learning this stuff, give me a brieak, don't trust me
      100% here, I take it from open and common sources, but we saw the
      distances to the planets and how google mislead us (специально или
      нечаянно, кто разберёт и какое значение)<br>

      This final image is actually the first I found, so it is the first
      to talk about. I was confused by mercurie's orbit. And I googled
      orbits gif. And this was what came to me. I don't think it's our
      solar system. But everyhtin could be: mercury is light. I found
      the source of it: <br>
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity but I didn't
      dig into it. I think those other gifs are more about our solar
      system. Or imagine if we could only see mercury flying across the
      sun and we didn't have an idea about how those planets actually
      go? Impossible. Звездочёты только тем и занимались, что планеты
      наблюдали? я понятия не имю, это галлерея.<br>
