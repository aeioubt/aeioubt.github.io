      <p>eFGH<br>
      </p>
      <p>oPQRST</p>
      <p>F &amp; P sounds are put by the same letter (standing where P
        does) in hebrew<br>
        g&amp;q — no wonder they're similar, they're from the same
        column in latin<br>
        h looks like a bigger r and when you write it by hand it often
        looks like R:</p>
      <p><img alt="" src="img/486.JPG" width="248" height="284"><br>
      </p>
      <p>sometimes h reflects s &amp; t:<br>
        h is named ʌʃ in latin, which makes it similar to ש which stands
        where s does.<br>
        h is named eitʃ in english, which makes it similar to ch which
        is an invariant of t.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So here I claim that bigger line is an extended form of a
        smaller one. It seems here some lands <font color="#C0C0C0">(vowels

          for earth, not for air, as sefer yetzirah tells — maybe for
          jews it's air, because they lost their land, but now they
          regained it, so what's the point in philosophy of gone. Though
          in the very beginning of the volume <a
            href="file:///home/mahead/aeiou-git/aeioubt.github.io/III.html"><font
              color="#C0C0C0">III</font></a> I stumbled across a
          perspective showing that א does stand for air and I'm just
          tripping, or does א stand for air in abrahamic concept of god,
          and when mother was the fairy Earth, it was earth which
          opposed fire (coming from the sky) as solids oppose plasma
          i.e. special case of gas)</font> invented their modes from
        pentatonica of abcd to 7-... why do I ignore that there's not 5
        &amp; 7, but 4 &amp; 6 letters? It relates to some musical
        concepts I only slightly remember. there are 4 &amp; 6 intervals
        between 5 &amp; 7 tones. And it relates to this image of the
        memorial stone of Gvido who allegedly invented the 7-note
        sequence we use today, but it only shows 6 of them:</p>
      <p><img
          src="file:///home/mahead/aeiou-git/aeioubt.github.io/img/277.png"
          alt="" width="646" height="404"><br>
      </p>
      <p>Does opqrst reflect abcd as well? After all a &amp; o are also
        similar:<br>
      </p>
      <p>ABCD<br>
      </p>
      <p>OPQRST<br>
        a&amp;o are vowels, a even sounds like o in all &amp; å<br>
        b&amp;p are labials (some culters don't distinguish between them
        also)<br>
        c can stand where q use to: qabala, but cabal (I will further
        speak of these words)<br>
        d is directly similar to t, but what about r &amp; s?<br>
        d is similar to russian &amp; scottish r, for those r's are made
        with tongue.<br>
        d is similar to s when in greek, they pronounce it as th in the.<br>
        But of course s in much more similar to c — it probably derives
        from it as ç<br>
        c is г in russian which reminds r in both looks &amp; sounds
        when r is english.<br>
        So how do I reconcile it with what I said before?<br>
        With that fact that in runes there are only 3 letters in the
        first line: ᛆᛒᚦ<br>
        More on this subject of actual antiquity of runes will arrive
        later.<br>
        And if we notice, that QR repeat OP sequence, OPST look like
        ABCD alright<br>
      </p>
      <p>ABCD<br>
      </p>
      <p>EFGH</p>
      <p>This pair of rows can be preventing humans from understanding
        this structure the most: D &amp; H — is there anything common
        between them? First of all, they both are made with tongue (you
        can breath out with tongue out, making a similar noise, but
        strictly speaking it will be some other phoneme) and it will be
        easier for you to see similarity if you keep in mind that c
        &amp; d used to be invariants and as F seems to be a palatalized
        form of B (just as E of A) H is palatalized C and g stands for d
        in russian alphabet, which is honestly not that far apart.<br>
      </p>
      <p>EFGH<br>
      </p>
      <p>IJKLMN<br>
      </p>
      <p>This row is the most difficult, because it is the only one
        where labial doesn't follow vowel directly. And it is universal
        among all the alphabets. I have proposed different reasons in
        the previous versions of this work, you can read it <a
          href="old-index.html">h</a>er<a href="index-28.html">e</a>.
        And now I'm only revisiting that material, making it more simple
        and clear.<br>
      </p>
      <p>You can see K under G, which could explain why they needed J as
        a separate leter. Exactly why they needed to separate U form V,
        to separate it's different readings. And as e-row ends with H,
        i-row ends with N — H is how N looks in russian. A weird things
        are n looks like v in greek and n stands for p sound in russian,
        and p stands for r in russian. It's an interesting topic of
        different approach to the same topic from greece and rome, I
        haven't researched it yet.<br>
      </p>
      <p>ABCD<br>
      </p>
      <p>UVWXYZ<br>
      </p>
      <p>that VW thing actually reflects russian БВ — I don't claim here
        that russian alphabet could influence the latin one, but I claim
        that the same (yet unknown) concepts could influence them both.
        Or, of course, it could all be just a coincidence.. nah, chaos
        is uncomprehended order.<br>
      </p>
      X as we know it in english combines velar and coronal, and velar
      precedes coronal, as they do in alphabet. X as we know it in
      russian [h] it stands just beneath h. Y is secretly one of those
      UVW, but in english it's never made with libs, but with tongue
      instead. Z can be considered an invariant of X, because x
      sometimes sounds like z, but it also reflects D as Δ's read in
      greece today [ð]. Though russian alphabet descends from some from
      of greek, russians read their D, Д, as [d], but their second row
      ends with З [z] even though that row there is even more mutilated
      than in greek, it somehow shows that z it's place (in greek z
      replaces θ and the fact that θ is final in that row in both greek
      and hebrew alphabets could explainded why it's considered to be
      literally [θ] even though greeks pronounce it closer to [f] and
      russians never saw it as anything else but [f] which tells it's
      the lost labial in greek, and would be in russian if they didn't
      taboo this letter to elimination)<br>
