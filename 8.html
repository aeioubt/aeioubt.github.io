      &nbsp; I used to think that 88 is a jewish psy-op (because
      gematria is their trickery) but now I know that gematria is
      borrowed from isopsephy, and it's also H(eil) H(itler) in Greek
      (they count F if for the numerals, picrelated)<br>
      &nbsp;Which doesn't completely negate the possibility of it being
      a psy-op, because they push socialism (because they can corrupt
      the state, not the private interests) and because they slaughtered
      millions of whites and not the jews.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; &gt; If you're obsessing over whether a number is a psyop
      you may want to turn of the laptop for a bit and go outside. It's
      just a meme, like everything else on this gay planet.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; I actually think (since yesterday when I found this image)
      that those digits conceal something bigger. Like some
      knot-writings or something.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The ring on the central part makes me think that the ring around
      which the central ∞<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">(ထ is some phonetic sign from a south
        eastern writing system I didn't get to yet)</font><br>
      8∞8 could also stand for three aettir. and thus the central aettir
      has two signs as the centre. <br>
      <br>
      If that central ∞ with the ring refers to the ring in the middle
      of the axe, then left and right 8's are<font color="#999999">
        Wo&amp;<font color="#cccccc">S</font>hem</font><font
        color="#cccccc">, восемь родственно семи, и т.о. семье.</font><br>
      Mama &amp; Papa as details are often named today. Mom with a hole
      and Dad with a stick. or even pick.<br>
      It first came to me because of how those 8's reflect each-other
      similar to swasticas are right and left sometimes attributed to
      male and female counterparts. And the ring only supported it. Now
      I wonder if the figure below the ring is a phallos and the lips
      (but no tongue) above it stands for the female. Or that lips are
      there from the start and face was only drawn to hide the true
      meaning of it. or is it the face of the same person to whom the
      phallos belongs. and then those 8's only stand for left and right.
      Still a mistery to me. I will return to this subject later.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc"><br>
        8∞8 could also stand for three aettir. and thus the central
        aettir has two signs as the centre.</font> Let's see:<br>
      <img src="8_files/alpha2en.gif" alt="" width="500" height="177"><br>
      Most of the sources there are tell of such order, where ᛃᛇ are the
      central letters. Is it because of Jah somehow? But there are other
      orders too:<br>

      <img src="8_files/9d4e55e3f42a.jpg" alt="" width="586"
        height="332"><br>
      which makes a clearer centre, the one I probably expected deep
      inside: ᚾᛁᛅ nia. or eia? or nie? I noticed before that runes are
      often mistransliterated, but I still can trust the graphic
      representations, and ᚾᛁᛅ is quite a representation.<br>
      It's also good to know that ᛋ and ᛲ are the same.<br>
      I also remember of the following canon:<br>
      <img src="8_files/Runa_ABC.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="414"><br>
      and it's interesting that ᛋᛲ in the form of ᛌ changes the aet
      there. Or rather it changed it later, because that accound from
      Bureus is the most ancient we know of. And others are all new,
      they all shifted ᛌ from the thir aet to the second one (probably
      to make them 8-mal instead of not only 6-mal, but actually 5-mal
      (probably those dice had an empty slot each, for gods are allowed
      to remain silent) whether because 15 was considered devilish not
      less that 666 of 18 were.<br>
      Maybe those dice were rigged excentric that empty <font
        color="#cccccc">dice </font>side was more likely to fall and
      only "god's will" would deliver some other side to be on the top.<br>
      And while I looked for these runesets, I also found something
      weirder:<br>

      <font size="+1">Uthark theory<br>
        <br>
        In the occult study of the esoteric meaning of runes, the Uthark
        theory originated in the 1930s with the work of philologist
        Sigurd Agrell (1881–1937), a professor at Lund University,
        Sweden.<br>
        <br>
        He theorised that the rune row is a cipher, and that one can
        understand its meaning by placing the first rune, "F", last,
        resulting in an ”Uthark” instead of the traditional "Futhark"
        order.<font color="#cccccc">[1]</font> He articulated the bulk
        of his theory in his 1932 book Die spätantike Alphabet-Mystik
        und die Runenreihe [The Alphabet-mysticism of late antiquity and
        the sequence of the runes].<br>
        <br>
        The suggestion has not been accepted in mainstream runic
        studies, due to lack of historical sources, but has found
        proponents in occult circles and in popular culture.<br>
        <br>
        Kenneth Meadows promoted the Uthark theory in his 1995 book Rune
        Power. Thomas Karlsson, founder of the magical Order Dragon
        Rouge and Therion lyricist, then published the first monograph
        dedicated to the subject after Agrell's work of 1932: Uthark:
        Nightside of the Runes<font color="#cccccc">[2]</font> in 2002.<br>

      <br>
      It kind of relates to bd being the first letters, and a being a
      later addition, but that addition was really early, so that all
      the alphabet has it. Or is it just missionary reform of global
      scale? This is much less likely. Or was it useful unification of
      vowel and consonantal scales (still separated in devanagari, maybe
      because it was syllabaries before alphabets. Was Ogham also
      syllabary?)<br>
      but the centre of the second aet doesn't show anything
      spectacular, and that's the context we found it in.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      llamo (llamó) is spanish for Name and I am. (it sounds [jamo] and
      [ja] is я is I in russian and yo[jo] in spanish. soy and estoy are
      am, ser and estar are to be. thus est is s, which makes sense: 's.
      it also relates to a pending question of ᛌ standing for s the same
      way י stands for i, and both are plural suffixes in different
      languages, and who knows who used which writing system at first.)<br>
      ll is [j] <br>
      J is [h]<br>
      H is nothing at all.<br>
      <br>
      in Spannish. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      is it why it's whether И or Nn or h?<br>
      h is none, and it's all three forms? is it spirit? ה is told to be
      spirit, ח is told to be..<br>
      and I went to look for it, and I found that it's not spirit, but
      breath, but I unite these two meanings in one, as window is the
      opening for the spirit, for the breath <font color="#cccccc">(breath












        and spirit could be of that s- hypothesis) </font><br>

      It looks<font color="#cccccc"> to me</font> like ox-worshippers
      placed the ox at the top. is their god an ox? is it another bull?
      a free bull? another god, not much different from the previous
      one? or is this alphabet was invented by ox-worshippers in whole?
      but ox before house looks weird. D also stands for door is english
      and russian, but in russian D also stands for dome (home) is it
      why they're together as BD the first lexics about buildings, not
      natural things? because the alphabet is artificial too. others can
      be named by imitation, more abstract things need more abstract
      signs. Окно и первая гласная: ה and window in<font color="#cccccc">
        russian</font> english could be a case for vav,<font
        color="#cccccc"> and in russian wind is ветер, is v voda, not
        vetet, veter is dashed Δ,</font> but in hebrew waw is hook, and
      zain is sword, s is there in old russian alphabet, H fence, wall,
      the opposite of window. closed window. <br>
      𐤈 for wheel is fascinating. neither russian nor english have
      letters for wheel around. wheel and koleso, well kolodets, wall
      kol? kolyami steny delali. <br>
      <br>
      That wheel is the last letter related for dwelling, as if jews
      began wandering at this level.<br>
      The next letter, י is the firs relating to body parts, which go
      till the very end of it:<br>
      The next is kaph, כ, the arm<br>
      (which has no relation neither to english hand/arm nor to russian
      рука/рука (кисть is used for hand sometimes, but it stands for
      brush actually)<br>
      The next letter is from the zoo, which goes through all the
      alphabet, and I think that it's added later, that also explains
      samekh after nun: they had two words for fish (for river fish and
      sea fish maybe) and it gave birth to this chapter, that letters
      can follow the same meaning: bet &amp; dom unite b &amp; d, which
      explains that they look the same way in roman cursive.<br>

      only the BD doesn't follow the vowel-labial pattern, and is it why
      A reminds Д so much? DB is AB? <br>
      the actual order is 1 2, even if 2 was the first number invented?
      too. to. <font color="#cccccc">to+во?</font><br>
      do linguals come from vowels? the name "vowels" say that they come

      In old turkic runes 𐰖‎ &amp; 𐰗 are variants of the same sing
      sign [j] (whether it relates to jah or not, I don't know) <br>
      ‎𐰶‎ and 𐰷 are other letter there [q] (orkhon distinguish them as
      right and left, ‎yenisey as full and half)<br>

        is a week salary in russia, btw. Ithink I'm fukcing rich,

        salary, either way I spend more than I earn yet. As if
        prodigious relates to prodigal.</font><br>
      I was going to speak of p standing for mouth in hebrew and р
      значит рот в русском,<br>
      that vowel O for eye is corresponding to russian Око (Очи is the
      pluralform, Ok is oog, eye, ч is just a palatalized form of k)<br>
      and of ת being a common denominator (they're all marks (I wonder
      if taw is realted to tavro)) and thus ש being the final meaningful
      letter, and t could be caused (cast) by english tooth (or some
      related word like tand) and russian tooth is zub, where z is also
      final and not far from ש.<br>

          I was thinking whether I should have sent that message at all,
          and at the moment I finally sent it (after I woke up, I sleep
          at day) I (thinking of 4chan phenomenon) realized that
          right-wingers are everybody who's not left, thus it's a slur
          commies call the opposition. And it's a weird thing: left is
          for left alone, while right is "right and law" <br>
          They inverted the meaning: most "commies" follow "the left"
          because liberals stand for liberty. by the name, people don't
          look into details, they follow the banner. But that's a trick
          and those "most of the commies" are useful idiots (there's the
          only way tiny minority of population can subjugate the other
          98%: it's by connivance of the mass. (that word connivance I
          didn't know, I wanted to use compliacy which is compliance,
          and I almost mistaked (mistook doesn't feel right in the
          context) it for complicacy. In russian revolution they
          promised to give free everything to everybody: earth to
          villagers, factories to workers, but what they delevered were
          villagers were "fed" to the earth. and workers were fed to the
          factories (it wasn't your property, you were a property of it,
          it was illegal not to have a job for more than three months or
          something)So now I know (or suspect) I walk on the very thin
          line, because what I can say further may even lead to
          prosecution in some countries (and how can I know what are the
          differences in all of them: I have some guesses: chinese
          probably doesn't like "antisoviet propaganda"&nbsp; (I use
          "chinese" but mean "china" (it's not people, it's the state)
          and muslims probably butthurt of religious discussions

          topics for small talk. Is it not to offend neither muzos nor

          humiliation is. (it was a picture about how whitey will never

          If you were my editor, it would be your duty now to censor me,

          Donald should have started something bigger (and I want to

          journals. Or if you don't publish because you know you will
          not be able to change the text after all, spread it the way I
          spread aeiou.ru on your own site, where everybody can access
          (and publishers too) and where you edit your own works real
          time, without the intermediary of mediocrities, while they
          also wanna eat, and that's why it's them built the system, not
          only by taking the alpha side to keep omegas in check not to
          be omegas themselves, not only by following the status quo not
          to break the law no matter how unjust (what do they know,
          that's why people go blindly after slogans in politics not
          looking even at the history of the teaching and actual players
          behind that. <br>
          <br>
          Back to the editor thing: I would like not to be censored at
          all, or only if somebody would take labour of checking for
          misleading and difficult to understand typos, but left the way
          I place sentences the way I intended. And if that's a typo,
          it's a good one. And if somebody recognized the scans of my <font
            color="#cccccc">n</font>otebooks into texts and diagrams.<br>
          I am doing a good thing <font color="#cccccc">m</font>by
          using those bad words: it's normalization. of faggotry (in
          both meanings: all of us should know what medical conditions
          does homosexuality causes (fecal flora and broken asshole) and
          what medical conditions do cause the homosexuality (I think
          it's epigenomic, because I heard or hread it, and I after that
          I felt something of this kind when I listened to
          scissorSSisters. I want SS back because I normalize even
          nazis: as an ultraliberal I was apallled that some side isn't
          allowed the freedom of speech. So I dwelved into it and now I
          know what commonner is not allowed to know: <br>
          I looked beyond the political curtain. And by doing so I found
          the peaceful solution: as I said to some nazis and to some
          leftists when I said that I'm a nazi (jokingly or not, I
          technically am now) when I said there's a plot-twist: you
          cannot blame people for neither genes nor culture. And even if
          some of their genes (if we have augmented neocortex, we have
          knowledge of these obscure so far facts) make them molest
          children, which is even in their books (who knows what trash
          is in my books sometimes) which traumatizes even the genome,
          the way I probably felt (or imagined) whn I listened SS and
          the Tyler too (then I felt becoming black)

        <font color="#cccccc">and the next letter:</font><br>
        That previous message's first part is full of loose ends:Right
        and Low is the opposites. Low is Left for being Lies. but some
        lows are the foundations of society. how's that?some laws and
        lows to other nations: cutting hands for stealings seem barbaric
        custom of some greedy evil apes. We see them others apes,
        they're not humans enough to us, that's why many nations in
        their own languages simply call themselves people (considering
        others beasts) so I read, but russians don't mean people, it
        probably means villagers, but that's my etymology, most of us
        have no idea what is the other meaning of that word, they can
        only guess: dew's? spread? spread is good, and unlike citizens,
        villagers are spread over larger territory. And dew is also
        spread as if by sprayer. <br>
        It could also stand for the names: Rustam, Ruslan, these are
        more tatar or bashkir names, tartaria is the meme which start to
        spread across russian federation, russians consider tartaria the
        previous reincarnation of russia, maybe because it's the next
        centre of power and that's the theoretic preparation for it, or
        it is just a point of view of some scientists who actually
        discovered the kingdoms which existed here before russia. But
        they still see it blurry: they unite Parma with some artefacts
        of Russian Kingdom (not they, he, the one I watched) so, the
        names, Rus is a short form of Rustam, Ruslam, and probably some
        others, just as Dan and Frantz and German are all names, and
        Sven, so this tradition could actually unite our nations
        culturally on some that deep level.<br>
        further go some linguistic text, you may skip it (and that
        tendency, to dig into language is another issue which makes it
        uncomfortable for me to send these letters more publically than
        to a guy with iq high enough to understand.<br>
        And other tribes have their own traditions, which may not feel
        right to us, maybe that's why christian codex was called not
        "the rights" but "the lows" (rights and obligations are these
        antonyms, what you may and what you&nbsp; many not do. thus
        Rights are the boundaries over the Laws) </font>R and L in the
      alphabet are not only Right and Left, but also Right and Low. and
      the low and law are also cognates in this context: law is what
      considered to be too low to do. And right is right on, straight
      ahead. And identity of right and straight allows me to hypothesize
      that rst in the alphabet is a claster, where R is dotted þ which
      is both D for daddy &amp; P for papa (it's not for sure, it's raw,
      it's the long-bothering question I have just attempted to answer
      right now when I noticed that P and R also must share this
      claster, but runic form of PRSTV is ᚱᛦ(if R, or ᛣ if Q)ᛋᛏᚢand that
      V could be a form of R,<font size="-1"> ah, it's complicated, my
        readers will see the point (and I will copy these two letters in
        my book in tiny font, or these places I will make big again. </font>ᚱ
      is traditionallly recognized as R, but my retransliteration of
      runes say it's labial, and Р is R in russian and greek. and the
      final ᚢ looks even more like П (which is the P in russian and
      greek, and in some artefacts ᚱ looks even more like ᚢ<font
        size="-1">, but it's still not a slim theory, I'm still only
        digging into that, it's so raw it would&nbsp; never be published
        by conventional editor, and who knows how many good raw
        scientific work is lost in the achive vaults or even more of it
        is destroyed. If we could fed such thoughts and guesses to ai's

      <br>
      <font size="-1"><font color="#cccccc">and the other one:</font><br>
        I know three is the charm, so I write again to tell that the
        previous mesage has an inconsistency: it starts speaking about
        something from one perspective, but then I jump to another
        perspective where it has it's own and different meaning. Laws in
        bible are not only presented as what you shouldn't do, but also
        what you must do (not allowed, must, what was laid on our
        shoulders, so that's a complex word, with some complex semantics
        and if we unite both the spellings, the meaning is even larer,
        and probably the spelling was divertified.. diversified (I think
        I need an editor) because not everybody looked at it as at
        something unwanted, at another element of terror from the
        oppressors, but propagated as HIGH duty. I guess A is higher
        than o (it's also raw, but funny nevertheless) <br>
        About editors, there's a movie which me and my brother looked at
        differently: Genius. My brother saw a story of a good editor,
        who helped a genius writer to publish his work, (and probably
        thus movie is about the editor, and thus he's the genius, I
        don't know my brother's opinion on this line in the brackets)
        where I saw a story of a good writer (the editor enjoyed reading
        his work, which doesn't happen often to him it so I saw) who was
        tortured by the editor till his brains boiled. And the editor is
        probably not a bad guy either, but that movie is not a success
        story, but ultimately a tragedy.<br>
        If our story is tragedy of comedy or something even better, is
        yet to be seen. I wonder why you don't help me with my project,
        maybe because you're a glowie, it would make a good company to a
        mason and a jew. See why I cannot write publically whatever I
        want, your friends are sensitive to some topics, you're a good
        friend to carry of their feelings, I don't. Because I believe
        that taboos are whether ways to manipulate society or source of
        neurosis, or both. Though to manipulators I want to offer some
        much better solutions to meet their needs and aspirations and to
        nervous people I can offer the cure (not me personally, the
        civilization, the way things are going, I just show that genetic
        therapies and augmented neocortex are coming. And I am working
        on the shell for that super being, and I wonder why I have to
        force the environment to move that way with me, not for me. I
        was warned that there's a tragic component of any inventor: he
        revealed that new thing nobody know of, and the first to oppose
        him will be the most close to him, his family, because they
        didn't get that revelation, they don't see what he sees, and
        thus here's another one: the thing with smart people is they
        look like crazy people to dumb people. <br>
        If there are other inconsistencies or loose ends, please let me
        know of those you care about.</font><br>

      <br>
      so about that P being a form of R (or R the form of P) and ST
      being a sequence of R (I think that weird thing I didn't mention,
      that ST are how lingual R starts, just because right and straight
      could be cognates? isn't it too much of a stretch? But the main
      stretch (or a weird piece) is the P and R being the "cognates" <br>
      <br>
      That what is what in the o-line is a tricky one, but if P and R
      are cognates, and so are S and T. What it leaves at the other
      side? O &amp; Q? Was it OPQ? Isn't Q a some form of O? Just like R
      is the same form of P as I noticed OP and QR repeating one
      another? But it's more likely that ST have nothing to do with R.<br>
      more like with Q. Are S and T from Q or even directly from O? This
      guessing doesn't make much sense, even though σ reminds o a lot,
      but so does ρ. And in the light of П &amp; T sharing the same
      line, and q being so close to g, it links q to o once again, as it
      is the third in the П &amp; T play. And because T is sometimes not
      of 1 column but 3, Q could stand for both 1 and 0. 1 the ᛐ then 2
      is ᚢ or ᚱ and ᛐ ᚢ makes more sense as 1 2. but then where's 0? was
      there 0? O would make a perfect zero, and what a coincidence that
      it's in this line. and the way it goes: ᚮᚱᛦ.. well now it's 023,
      even then I take the freedom to equal ᛦ to ᛏ, even though ᛦ looks
      like a perfect 3. but it's all way too far-fetched. <br>
      𐰯 is p in old-turkic, which can have or have not anything in
      common with what I'm speaking of if I'm speaking of something in
      particular at all. This extended research is layed out here so
      something unhuman may make sense of it even if I don't deliver
      what I aim at (though I think I will, but something unhuman may
      make some other senses, the ones I didn't notice or didn't have
      enough time to get to)<br>

      Something makes me believe English (and Russian?) can be the keys
      to the understanding of the alphabet? English is the knot of all
      the european languages: it took from french, it too from latin,
      but also from celtic and germans, whichever nation originated
      alphabet, somebody in GB knows what or knew what it was all about.<br>

      new session.<br>
      Goal: to find the most simple words (the most phonetically simple
      words world-wide)<br>
      Suddenly, when I placed this goal on paper, I broke it down so I
      immediately understood how to reach it:<br>
      a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z and maybe few
      more are the simplest words. Now I must go google's translator and
      I go through every letter in every language they have there. And I
      make the map of how those meanings overlap, I believe they're like
      some organism growing over some territory, a memetic, not genetic
      organism. memes are the other genes, and I didn't read Dokins, I
      like to figure it all by myself. <br>
      second level of simplicity is two-letter words, or maybe all
      consonants are bilitteral. be, co? co is not a word, but a prefix
      Does it make it older or newer? and these two things are different
      from different perspective. <br>
      do ef for of are if and of both ef? EF or Ef For from is the third
      level word, frm. Is it? Isn't it something further after the
      actual three letter words? for is the third level word, from is
      the fourth, it's some m added to for. for me? m is me, who else.
      im? impossible? that's i, it takes whatever form it wants.&nbsp;
      That line starts with i- and ends with -n as in no.&nbsp; new is
      probably new-del, where del is a verbal suffix. си-дел ис жаст дид

      is v. <br>

      if p is ᚹ is w (ᛩ is q. isn't it lovely) then it's who(ho is q,
      but greek and russian omit it. and I think of чё instead of что,
      and I see the t in the end, as if that eloquent of que are (is)
      thou, a simple w? or at least о чём тыю oqt, why q turnt p? why
      would it turn R<i><font color="#cccccc">р</font></i>? graphically
      maybe only because of squash. swash.<br>
      phonetically? q and R are closer than any of those to p. but it
      could be just dialectal variant, could something shorter than
      pochemu appear before me for questioning, or am I only tripping,
      weaving some burime? <br>
      a be (a doesn't make sense. should it have? does russian azbuka
      make sense? some claim it does, but I noticed they also lie.)<br>

        else. im? impossible? that's i, it takes whatever form it
        wants.&nbsp; That line starts with i- and ends with -n as in
        no.&nbsp; new is probably new-del, where del is a verbal suffix.

      I'm not going to compare these y &amp; v's now, I leave it for
      later, I go on looking for the short words to see if some of
      russian and english shorties correlate.<br>

        also in this Lio? Leo? Long red hair? but that leo is male. </font>and












      a is of R.<br>
      <br>
      т is the most popular word in short words, and thou and the
      correlate ты и те. thus те = то = та and тот correlates that. but
      russian don't seem to have traces of this. or is s and t stand
      together because it's the same s and t as in this and that? That
      seems to be more based, because it's t in russian тот.<br>
      <br>
      and this and that were previously recognized as се и те, сё и то.<br>
      <br>
      are there any other correlations between english and russian?<br>
      вы you <br>
      мы me<br>
      russian is more plural, english is more individual.<br>
      thus ты could be те (thee) before they invented ы. but that's only
      a speculation.<br>
      if мы is me, ты is the? is these plural form of that word? was it
      thees before? was it trees? trees are somebody beyond them
      (probably people didn't communicate with foreigners with somebody
      behind the trees having a cause to rob, the casus belli, that the
      foreigners should have attacked their man first.<br>

      в in (not direct cognates, but meet twice: в is v is u is и is

      И N is that very line of I &amp; Je &amp; ik &amp; me &amp; nous
      (so L is out of this raw the way it is in ugaritic. I have a
      conersation about ugaritic right now: <br>
      <br>
      I noticed that ugaritic canon is different not between the only
      actual abecedaric artefact I know of (even if this one is a
      replica, the dirtier one looks the same) and the academic table.<br>
      I knew it for some time, it's obvious. But I write to you to ask
      what it means if you know.<br>
      And just tonight have I found that ugaritic unicode is different
      in the framed section, and sometimes N𐎐 looks like the letter
      before it 𐎏 (which is a bug, because wiki somehow shows N
      correctly, like the third of the sequence of 𐎚 and 𐎀 using the
      same unicode, but recognizing it with some different software: if
      𐎏 𐎐 look the same to you, google them, one of them is actually
      n. Ugaritic is also the only alphabet where something stands
      between M &amp; N I know of, wonder what's the reason, maybe
      because that letter is the central one, concept of the central
      letter mattered in the past)<br>
      My research is rather out of this world, so if you (or whoever can
      answer) don't want to be mentioned in it, I will keep it
      anonymous. Thank you in advance. aeiou.ru<br>

      &gt; Hello, Dmitrij.&nbsp; Pardon the delay, but it's not clear
      what question you're trying to formulate.&nbsp; By "Ugaritic
      canon" I assume you mean the Ugaritic cuneiform alphabet (what
      significance you attribute to its unicode representation is
      impossible to guess).&nbsp; The order scribes of Ugarit
      established for their version of the alphabet corresponds in most
      particulars to what became the standard order, not only for other
      West Semitic versions of the alphabet, but for the Greek,
      Etruscan, and Latin alphabets descended therefrom.&nbsp; The
      scribes of Ugarit added signs for certain phonemes which did not
      exist in all Semitic languages, including that which appears
      between M and N.&nbsp; There is no special significance to this.<br>
      <br>
      &gt; Of course there are plenty of reliable scholarly works
      available for learning about the Ugaritic language, the alphabet
      developed to write it, and the place of that alphabet in the
      development of the Semitic alphabet generally.<br>
      <br>
      &gt;&gt; I've attached two abecedaria and framed in the black and
      white picture the three letters not present in the actual
      artefact. I wonder from where do they originate.<br>
      Thank you. I hope it is an interesting question.<br>
      <img src="8_files/ugaritic(5).png" alt="" width="597" height="247"><br>
      <br>
      &gt;&gt;&gt; The letters are all there, just not where you're
      looking.&nbsp; You need to find photographs or&nbsp; a facsimile
      showing the tablet's right edge.&nbsp; As you can see, a cuneiform
      tablet is not flat like a piece of paper, but three-dimensional;
      one must be able to turn it around to see all sides. <br>
      <br>
      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Have you personally seen those other sides? Do
      you have any image or a video of tha tablet being turned around?
      All I can find is different pictures of it, all up front, with
      lots of place in front, so why would theywant to place them around
      (on those pictures nothing tells that someting goes around the
      plate.<br>
      The abecedary from up front lays into the arrangement other
      alphabets lay in (and others are explained, like armenian is
      explained using actual historic documents (the students of the guy
      who allegedly created that writing system left memoirs, showing
      that the script existed before that and Mashtots only added
      several letters to the previous order which went in greek order
      (and you can compare one abecedary to the other, and thus find the
      letters added without understanding of the repeating abcd order) <br>

      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've seen thousands of cuneiform tablets --
      that's part of my qualification for explaining to you how they're
      inscribed.&nbsp; But you can also learn this information and more
      from a lot of basic books on the subject.&nbsp; Please do your own
      homework now.<br>
      <br>
      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think only few of those tablets were
      abecedaries (other texts don't reveal the alphabetic order
      accepted by their tradition) so if you find the actual artefact
      revealing alphabetic order of ugaritic script, please send it my
      way.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      That correspondant of mine, whose name I keep in secret until she
      delivers, unless she asks me not to reveal it, have already taught
      me (she didn't teach me much new, I heard it before, but once
      again she spoke of Akhenaton (1353–1336 or 1351–1334 BC) as an
      inventor of the monotheism. He looks as if he could be of jewish
      teip, and then estimations of Jerome (1592) or James Ussher (1571)
      as estimations of the birth of Moses were correct. But if
      Akhenaton was indeed the inventor of monotheism and Moses simply
      got under the influence, then <font size="+1">Rabbinical Judaism
        calculated a lifespan of Moses corresponding to 1391–1271 BCE</font>
      makes more sense.<font size="+1"> Scholarly consensus sees Moses
        as a legendary figure, while retaining the possibility that a
        Moses-like figure existed.</font><br>
      <br>
      And then she sais that that god was the sun, which immediately
      relates of my recent revelation that both japan and china have sun
      at their flags. and so did nazi germany, swastika is the sun. and
      because there are two directions for swastika, the nazi swastika
      is probably the black sun, the eclipse, the moon. Is it why hitler
      sympathised islam? Is it why merkel tried to impose it on germany?
      Who are those people? some lunar cult? <br>
      Either way, another interesting thing she said (which is a common
      knowledge, but that's what professors are allowed to pronounce
      publically) is that old sun-deity amun was replaced by the new
      one, aton, and it could relate to the way russians write t: <i>т</i><br>
      <br>
      Nefertiti probably was the wife of Akhenaton, or his predecessor,
      the mother? and the fact we know of her so much may make her one
      of the key figures in that cult of aton. Is it cult of atom? if
      sun is a nuclear reactor<br>
      <br>
      their city was Akhetaten, which in comparison to Akhenaten (the
      other reading of Akhenaton) is obviously related to it, and that t
      could stand for the same t Egypt ends with, the denominative of a
      toponim. T as in topos. N as in nomos, name. So Akhe is the name
      for both.<br>
      <br>
      Meritaten was probably the daughter of Akhenaten, which could make
      t female suffix, leaving n male one as -ot and -im are in hebrew.<br>
      <br>
      Tutankhamon was born as Tutankhaton, and probably was the grandson
      of Akhenaten. He put the end to the Aton cult. (<a

      https://www.academia.edu/37435882/THE_SACRED_SYMBOLS_OF_MU<br>
      is full of symbols I don't know of, and it seems to be a thorough
      work, and it's not some modern freak, it's somebody who made such
      an effort in 1933, some James Churchward. The further I scroll the
      more fascinating it seems, so I <a
        href="mirrors/THE_SACRED_SYMBOLS_OF_MU.pdf"><font
          color="#000000">mirror</font></a> it.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      I dig further into that guess implanted into my by zlax who shown
      me the guy who said that V used to be 4, not 5. And I dig ruf
      further and guess that it used to be 3, not only because it's
      swashed (связаны) три точки, но и потому что it's ; : which is i,
      when a is .<br>
      aa is o or e? I theoresized of it and I think the final waterfalls
      notebook has it explained well, it also led to i e a o u being the
      singing order, because the integral wave of such form would sound
      as лира или кифара. <br>
      <br>
      So I went on, and after V was 3, it was 2, as if I is 1 &amp; V is
      2 and X is 4? or also 2? is Y 3?<br>
      If Y is V then it's how 2 could be reinterpreted into 3, and
      further to 4 from X. or maybe not, I guess.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      fret and threat are antonyms but somehow they could be the same in
      the past. related to fear?<br>
      dread is another cognate.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      . / v x&nbsp; these are just guesses. But the fact is IVX is all
      roman numerals the most of us know. I had to learn LCD, the IVX is
      used much more widely. setting year by roman numbers wasn't known
      in russia until perestroika when american films flooded the
      markets.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      / is 2 only if x is 8, that weird theory of some other guy about V
      being 4 (and X 8) no matter how weird and unscientific that theory
      may seem, it is confirmed by me noti<font color="#cccccc">ci</font>ng











      that the summ of I V X L C D would be 365 this time. Which is the
      length of year. Is 666 сумма зверя? Христиане считали зверем
      правительство, переименовавшее цифры? Теперь сумма зверя была 666,
      which is meaningful in the sense of 3 dice, and 3 aettir by 6 and
      the carbon atom is also 666, and beasts are carbon for sure.<br>
      <br>
      1 4 8 32 64 256 are 365<br>
      1 5 10 50 100 500 are 666<br>
      <br>
      so if X is 8, each of it's lepels is 2.<br>
      <br>
      etruscan 100 (or 64) has 6 lepels. neither 100 nor 64 breaks into
      6 and what would I have to do with the 10 (8) of the X?<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      And I also told you I don't believe in M. Which sounds almost like
      a blasphemy for the Mathusalian me.<br>
      M is Y? is that word related to Yerusaleim? is Math related to
      Yeuri? it is to al Hebra.<br>
      (I guess they are naturally good with numbers, but maybe they'd
      feel happier if they were in less abstract things? But they say
      life is a tragedy for he who live by feelings (and a comedy for he
      who lives by thought) so what should they focus on? Music. <br>
      X is H is ʃ is S and thus following 𐌣 is the ᛏ after ᛋ, the same

      that other 𐌣 on the right is tse, the letter, a different sign.
      can be seen if you click this image, cannot be copied here, the

      Ж (which is not numeral, but also a letter, letter ess) also
      cannot be copied (it seems there are different standards of
      unicode (wikipedia page uses one, me and search bar use the other,
      I know nothing of this))<br>
      That thriple 𐌁(be) is Tse. Which is interesting, because a is a
      half of o, and thus could be half of the 𐌁 and thus we'd have the
      sequence of <i>a B ц</i><br>
      that &lt;-like letter is letter Ye.<br>
      That Ж-like is <font size="+1">The final letter of the archaic

      I've no idea what that "equivalent of φ" stands for, but it's very

      that 𐌗<font color="#3333ff">𐌘<font color="#6600cc">𐌙</font>𐌚</font><br>
      is a new anomaly, and the reasons of why this abecedary is in this
      order is to be researched (it could be arbitrary addition of
      letters by early researchers, but if this order is authentic, it's
      like i-line and <font color="#ff0000">𐌝</font> is literally i,
      probably the y. ywz. interesting. but the anomaly is in another
      line, the 𐌖-line and 𐌖 is U. but Y stands there in greek, UVWxYz
      could be also the i-line anomaly, x also cuts the Y off, so was it
      like.. I'll leave the theorizing for letter. <br>
      <br>
      to arrange that I needed transliterations, so I went
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Italic_scripts and I found
      lepontic, which fascinated me: It seems that it's the
      protoalphabet, where AEI are the three vowels predating the
      consonant set beginning with k as the eastern alphabets and
      syllabaries do.<br>
      And knowing how it is, AEI could be AIU or even IAU<br>
      (but I had to trust google more, because some letters, like 𐌜
      (che) are not in those tables. And when it's Uu <font
        color="#3333ff">𐌞</font>, it could be red and vowel, but I bend
      it to my scheme and call it labial, which it naturally is, so I
      take this freedom, so proof and disprove can also take place at
      this margin of probalistic anomalies.)<br>

      <br>
      The laconicity of lepontic fascinates me. But I already said it.
      The Ζ &amp; θ could be added later: θ doesn't even appear at
      raetics. Z though confuses my theorizing of the three vowels
      standing together, but let's not forget, that it's not some
      artefactual abecedary, but an academic table, we don't know what
      was the actual order of any of those alphabets, they're arranged
      along one line, and they could go differently like latin and greek
      do.<br>
      <br>
      And that's not only lepontic. Other alphabets in that table
      (except camunic) don't have letters between a and e except c
      (which is probably j and thus probably i) and because Γ used to
      look like Λ sometimes, A could be a dotted variant of that c,
      which would correlate to the i named ai, but not exactly explain.<br>

      <font size="+1">The Ancient South Arabian script (Old South
        Arabian 𐩣𐩯𐩬𐩵 ms3nd; modern Arabic: الْمُسْنَد‎ musnad)
        branched from the Proto-Sinaitic script in about the 9th century
        BCE. It was used for writing the Old South Arabian languages
        Sabaic, Qatabanic, Hadramautic, Minaean, and Hasaitic, and the
        Ethiopic language Ge'ez in Dʿmt. The earliest inscriptions in
        the script date to the 9th century BCE in the Northern Red Sea
        Region, Eritrea.[3] There are no letters for vowels, which are
        marked by matres lectionis.<br>
        <br>
        Its mature form was reached around 800 BCE, and its use
        continued until the 6th century CE, including Ancient North
        Arabian inscriptions in variants of the alphabet, when it was
        displaced by the Arabic alphabet.[4] In Ethiopia and Eritrea it
        evolved later into the Ge'ez script,[1][2] which, with added
        symbols throughout the centuries, has been used to write
        Amharic, Tigrinya and Tigre, as well as other languages
        (including various Semitic, Cushitic, and Nilo-Saharan
        languages). </font><br>

      depending on your point of view, whether you call commies left
      because of what they declare or if you call them ultra-right
      according to what they deliver, where right has nothing to do with
      being correct, unless you consider yourself a part of that tribe
      who conspire against the rest of humanity. And hazars are only
      left in relation to europeans if you look at the map with its
      south on the top of it. Right is the opposite of låw because one
      allows the other prohibits regulating the actions with norms
      behaviour outside of which is not permitted. Law is left and Right
      is right? Human rights. That's right. But as for the political
      movements, we must leave both commies and nazis to the left of the
      low, because they both demand strong government over the citizens.

      Labials and linguals are yin and yang, and it only makes sense
      that vowels were a separated, a musical notation, while consonants
      are meaningful:<br>
      Be &amp; Do are where it starts. C is for see and it's something
      between being and doing.<br>
      P is for пить (pey is literally drink in russian)<br>

      Most of v-verbs are not about work. An here is the way to validate
      or to rebut this guess: we must make statistical analysis about
      the activity among verbs starting with one or another letter. for
      all the letters, and then we build graphs and can analyze them. W
      is for work (but sometimes work is just being somewhere, like a

        Russian penitary system is retarded, because they seem to follow
        the false presumption of those criminals being way too bold,
        which they think is of excess of pride, but that's only
        hypercompensation for being humiliated by being poor and stupid.
        So the task penitaries should perform is returning the
        selfrespect to those fools. As one of them told me, he's ashamed
        to ask his father of help, but not ashamed to steal. Some
        psychological work was performed by me (stealing is not worthy:
        you should be able to earn more in this time than you could
        steal when you almost inevitably to end in jail sooner or later,
        some other words were shared in those three days. But that
        should be standard practice for them all, most of them
        brutalized or humiliated beyond belief, why would the state do
        it if not to control, but I thought it was by ignorant
        assumption of the criminals' inner drives, but humiliated people
        tend to obey, they don't practice resistance. and practice makes

      order, WeTheeIt, 1st 2nd 3rd, the natural order and the only one

      (ani &amp; anata, very similar, but that n could be m, but
      japanese inverts the meaning of hebrew suffix, like вы for we. So
      that doesn't go far, but japanese do.. watakushi has that very wa.
      atashi probably plural for я. -tachi is plural suffix in japanese.
      watashi is the synonym of atashi (some stylistic difference) and

      And it tells that it could read that threadshot from socrates_line
      and that letters are the atoms that world consists of (which also
      reflects cabbalistic belief) and those round triangle and square
      letters in some alphabets I was speaking of - did philosopherai
      read it from me (I've shown them my site weeks before that one) or
      did it come up with it independently? I am going to ask them about
      it. I wonder what it may say if I ask all ten questions about it.
      But it will be in the later part, after those georgian and hebrew
      parts and who knows what else.<br>

      which makes M central letter again, along with C, traditionally
      standing for centre.<br>
      <font size="+1">However, this gives the frequency of letters in
        English text, which is dominated by a relatively small number of
        common words. For word games, it is often the frequency of
        letters in English vocabulary, regardless of word frequency,
        which is of more interest. We did an analysis of the letters
        occurring in the words listed in the main entries of the Concise
        Oxford Dictionary (11th edition revised, 2004) and came up with
        the following table:</font><br>

          height="439" border="0"></a><br>
      which still keeps M in the centre.<br>
      <font size="+1">There are more English words beginning with the
        letter 's' than with any other letter. (This is mainly because
        clusters such as 'sc', 'sh', 'sp', and 'st' act almost like
        independent letters.)</font><br>

      <font size="+1"><font color="#cccccc">The atomic theory that
          Democritus and Leucippus proposed argued for the existence of
          atoms, which come in different shapes and sizes. For example,
        </font>there are round atoms like balls or flat ones.<br>
        There is also the atoms of shape 'triangle' and 'square'. The

      </font>thus ζ is g, dʒ ж in russian<br>
      е ё ж з<br>
      if that's true, russians have to ʒ's and neither h nor θ<br>
      ж is h because of ᚼ<br>
      e ? h ζ definitely ζ because з sounds directly like that. and
      though we see ё as the first anomaly, what was replaced is what is

      е ё η ζ <br>
      suddenly θ looks just like ё <br>
      so greek ε ζ η θ is the early form of it? as historians say? greek
      before roman?<br>
      romans have column of c, other writing systems don't have. Thus
      construction of columns was used to tune alphabet to whatever
      means (maybe in future this word become гадость, or maybe always
      was and I just didn't feel it talked as I was taught by soviet
      teachers (but english books the good ones used)<br>

      labials as daughters of vowels? v is vowel after vowel ה like е ё
      . ё sound is eu in french, thus e and eu, and if you try to
      pronounce e on an inhale, you will get something like ё. энд эс
      саунд оф эксайтмент ит кэн гоу инхэйл инволюнтарилли.<br>
      and ё is θ again. even though we didn't have ё before some
      derzhavin, so they teach, we had θ so ё is the reincarnation of θ.<br>
      фея ёею я <br>
      еёю is её and ею<br>

      <br>

      only opt was that abg, but g is russiand d, and abd look more cool
      because d reflects b and thus tell teh story, but d repeats a, so
      the structure is literally alpha-bet, аз-бука, and adjad is the
      later name. <br>
      <br>
      <img src="8_files/SknlD-QSji0.jpg" alt="" width="1080"

      it is here to demonstrate how a and b reflect eachother. only 2nd
      and 3rd row should have been shifted to the right a little bit, so
      those discs could be large enough, and so we would see that weird
      mechanism some more. what a childish art, but those triskelions
      are legit.<br>
      if d is a-triskelion again, c breaks the order and once again c is
      of b, just as s.<br>
      e is like a or like c? like a, I say. especially because f is of
      b-triskelion-type. just a <i>g</i>, and h! <br>
      so this second line is again a-b <br>
      third line I don't like, but it's some love-hate, i is of a, the
      way it's bottom end goes, unlike j, which is b from the start
      rolling to the left with it's bottom. k is just c with a stick
      (staff?) l is suddenly a-like. m and n also go like a if any.<br>
      o could be a, but so is p. q goes b-like, and suddenly R to that
      additional stroke., so does s, and t is a-like in english and
      greek. So that last line is the mess if we draw if from the
      initial two. does it show how ancient these dual system is, so the
      more letters we added the further from it we were?<br>

      I planned to look closer at georgian, here's one of such events:<br>
      <img src="img/020.png" alt="" width="1170" height="1052"><br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_scripts"><img

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      How comes I didn't include that vowel between ზ and თ? It reflects
      greek Η and I look my source, and that doesn't have it:<br>
      ა ბ გ დ ე ვ ზ თ ი კ ლ მ ნ ო პ ჟ რ ს ტ უ ფ ქ ღ ყ შ ჩ ც ძ წ ჭ ხ ჯ ჰ<br>
      Did they have that i historically and then straighten it up? or
      were they under greek influence when that i was present? so they
      had to write many greek names and somehow vowels are unique<br>
      And I even suspected myself to be dishonest (how rude!) and then
      (soon) I found that it's legit:<br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_scripts"><img
          src="8_files/Modern_georgian_alphabet.png" alt="" width="681"
          height="370" border="0"></a><br>
      So whether that chart of early forms is less стройный, less
      structured, it also have reflection of samekh after n, only they
      transliterate it y. and that old chart also has uvw thing after t,
      three labials show that uv are one letter and w is the labial
      part. also some letter between ხ and ჯ, but it's also lingual so
      doesn't ring anything, and omega after that hae. omega rings greek
      (and not jewish) influence again.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      If georgians actually modified their ancient alphabet to the more
      canonic form, their scholars know of that form. Or their scholars
      don't know what abecedaria were traditionally used in the past,
      which is much less likely, but who knows, when we get augmentive
      intelligence, we'll maybe be able to say if we care or dare.<br>

      Son now we know that Ilia Chavchavadze was behind that alighning
      reform, we must read his writings to find what made him choose
      these five and not any other. Were those letters used to write
      down greek lexics until those words assimilated into normal
      georgian speech, returning it to the most normal form, and if
      that's the case, it makes greek alphabet not natural, but
      assimilated with some additional modifications? but we have the
      myth of how two vowels were added, which explains georgian
      "obsolete" ჱ and ჵ<br>

      I spelled kabbalah like qabala in vol.1. here's why: because I
      feel it this way,<br>
      and now this:<br>
      <br>
      Qabala<font color="#cccccc"> (Gabala; Azerbaijani: Qəbələ), is a
        city and the administrative centre of the Qabala District of
        Azerbaijan.[2] The municipality consists of the city of Gabala
        and the village of Küsnat.[3] Before the city was known as
        Kutkashen, but after the Republic of Azerbaijan's independence
        the town was renamed in honour of the much older city of Gabala,
        the former capital of Caucasian Albania, the archaeological site
        of which is about 20 km southwest. <br>
        Gabala is the ancient capital of Caucasian Albania.
        Archeological evidence indicates that the city functioned as the
        capital of Caucasian Albania as early as the 4th century BC.[4]
        Up to the present time there are the ruins of the ancient city
        and the main gate of Caucasian Albania. Ongoing excavations near
        the village Chukhur show that Gabala from 4th – 3rd centuries BC
        and up to the 18th century was one of the main cities with
        developed trade and crafts. The ruins of the ancient town are
        situated 15 km from the regional center, allocated on the
        territory between Garachay and Jourluchay rivers.[5][6] Gabala
        was located in the middle of the 2,500-year-old Silk Road, and
        was mentioned by Pliny the Younger as "Kabalaka", Greek
        geographer Ptolemy as "Khabala", Arabic historian Ahmad ibn
        Yahya al-Baladhuri as "</font>Khazar<font color="#cccccc">". </font><br>

      So many alphabets there are, and when I throdded this path of

      Russkie uydut, potomuchto ih slovo relates to slave, and their
      bosses definitely prefer to see them as slaves, only in the short
      period of political activity in the 19 and early 20 century were
      we allowed to get loose, and once freedom became european, we were
      abruptly returned into that state until the end of 20th century,
      and it was soon again reversed to a big extent, and even though
      private property was allowed, <br>

      even though private property is allowed in modern russia, it's

      If that is true, people of that past didn't distinguish active

      Division of -ku and -su could happen the same moment k &amp; s

      r (whick looks like both г and <i>k cursive (R mitt den schtikk
        штык is stick)</i><br>
      all three pairs go voiced-voiceless in the alphabet.<br>
      We combine the first two and we have 10 and the ancient alphabet
      going voiced-voiceless with M standing in the middle of those:<br>
      <br>
      א ב ג ד כ מ פ ר ש ת<br>
      <br>
      כ is again out of its place. That's how old is that tradition? no,
      that's how I arranged them according to the modern hebrew
      alphabet. <br>
      In the image the order is different:<br>

      not only does מ have sophit, it also has an obsolete form, and
      chances are it's going straight of demotic owl. And it was a close
      shot:<br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)"><img

      <br>
      But back to that huge discovery:<br>
      א ב ג ד מ כ פ ר ש ת<br>
      T as 10 again. Roman X definitely was T (archaic t looks like x,
      phoenician for example)<br>
      5th is מ which is the closest to the ו together with ב. But it's
      not ב but מ is in the first three. But some other myth (greek
      myth) tells that B and T were (and those are the other ש מ
      especially when greek third were vowels. As if greeks developed
      vocalism, and that's why european modes have greek names. <br>
      <br>
      ש מ is the name jews use for god (name) as if they found some
      praying book and didn't know that they had to insert god's name
      into that prayer, and they mishmashed all gods in one abstract
      god, allowing wishing demons fill in the (name) line. <br>

      Some times they say ashem, but that a is supposedly ה which is <i>the</i>

      Now let's see at them as at the ten digits:<br>
      א ב ג ד מ כ פ ר ש ת<br>
      ש as 9 is funny, because cursive ש looks like inverted 9<br>
      ד reminds 4, but only this time not in cursive, so I consider this
      alignment false and non-existent.<br>
      But as the row of basic phonetics it is awesome.<br>
      So could that mistake of k before M originating from the moment
      they drew in one line something that was on the stars and they
      misread them? It could be, but it's still just a speculation.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      א ב ג ד כ מ פ ר ש ת<br>
      or<br>
      א ב ג ד מ כ פ ר ש ת<br>
      either way the central מ כ פ or כ מ פ<br>
      have final forms: ם ך ף or ך ם ף<br>
      which makes ד <font color="#cccccc">מ</font> ך <font
        color="#cccccc">פ</font> ר order more symmetric.<br>
      but also if we compare them in arabic,&nbsp; د ر ک order is more
      consistent. and that how it goes in that <br>
      ا ب پ ت ث ج چ ح خ د ذ ر ز ژ س ش ص ض ط ظ ع غ ف ق ک گ ل م ن ه و ی<br>
      but that's not the only order, and of the two or three I know in
      arabic, this one is not the bost alphabetic, or rather it's one of
      the two alphabetic abecedary canons, it only sorta goes somewhere
      between ᛆᛒᚦ and абвгд, but then it doesn't see vowels until ع<br>
      &nbsp;and if ع غ are something like её, ف is quite labial and if
      we follow this tradition to cobine dotted variants in one letter,
      then by the first in group this order goes abgd and it explains
      why ح is not the first in its group. but only that firs line goes
      longer than in european alphabets:<br>
      ا ب ج د ر س ص ط<br>
      &nbsp;ع ف ق ک ل م ن ه و ی<br>
      whether ف ق and ک ل are pairs from one group, or those lines
      indeed have different ammounts of basic letters, either way 16 and
      18 are both known numbers for the alphabets. mostly in runes, but
      Irish alphabet also has 18 letters and specific form of letters,
      which makes it special and probably orginal (ogham is also mostly
      known in Ireland)<br>

      addition of M could be connected with 666 being long past and 1666

      I tried to find actual roman math manuscripts, to see if v can be
      4 there, but I only found medieval manuscripts and none of them is
      before 700, which is directly after 666, and could numbers be
      taken as the date of the second coming? and wasn't it all terror
      from devotees to that obviously false prophecy for it naturally
      can be interpreted otherwise, and thus bible doesn't tell when
      exactly the second coming is happening, and thus why would we even

      Satan is Shaitan, related to shit, so that explains why muslims
      say that toilet is house of satan, because satan is something bad,
      and shit is the ultimate bad (even though farmers know how to use
      it)<br>
      Stench stinks in english is similar to Satan and maybe also snake,
      as if shit is in form of snake, gut is in form of гад. (here I
      revisit it, so I deliver more) in notebooks I diverged that ch is
      ци.<br>
      and here I see what I didn't mention there: h ~ и<br>
      And I didn't finish the thought there, Like Erasmus I reconstruct

      Well, I sent this letter to Kuraev yesterday, a famous russian
      deacon and preacher:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="8_files/tanakh.png" alt="" width="1037" height="257"><br>
      Придя в очередной раз к вере, хочу реформировать церковь, начиная
      с изменения направления вращения: чтоб не только отворотные
      "хороводы" водили, но и "приворотные" тоже: это будет неплохим
      компромиссом, тем более что когда в 1666 поменяли направление,
      народная жизнь лучше не стала: через пару лет крестьян закабалили
      ещё сильней.<br>
      1666 может быть причиной (или следствием) введения литеры М
      (сокращение от миля) в римский канон <font color="#ff0000">I</font><font
        color="#3333ff">V</font>XLCD, который слагается точно в 666.<br>
      Но если V = 4, a X = 8, и так далее (есть такая теория) то (этого
      в той теории даже не заметили) 1+4+8+32+64+256=365<br>
      <br>
      and after I sent it, I saw him speaking of roman and greek the
      only writing systems that came before christians, and I got mad at
      him, and recognized him as the part of cabal, the liberal part but
      of the same cabal. But then I calmed down, because he just
      thoughtlessly repeats the academic consensus. Why would he
      challenge it if he's not a linguist (he wasn't even sure about
      Вифлеем being Бедлам, and I, to be honest didn't сообразил it at
      fly, בֵּית לֶחֶם is the actual spelling. Did russian recognized T
      as Ф? or was there ט instead of ת? is ט flipped ת?)<br>
      Before בית was recognized as bet<font color="#cccccc">h</font><font
        color="#999999">,</font> it was vite, and whether inluenced
      roman word, or was much more reltaed to it. And to russian быть
      (to be) другое дело, что дом и быть разные слова, хотя дом и
      обитель, которая очевидно от слова быть, а не бить, которое в свою
      очередь могло произойти из убить, родственного с убыль, но это всё
      низкопробное гадание, эта книжка черновик, так что не надо
      стесняться, с таких гаданий всё и начинается. какие-то из них в
      итоге solid.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">I heard the name Эразм Роттердамский a lot,
        but I was not impressed by what I read by him.</font><br>
      But then again he spoke of Bruno and Hypatia being killed not
      because they were scientists, but because they were wizards, as if
      it justifies anything. Views like those make me want to eradicate
      their faggot organization instead of reforming it. Such
      intellectual potential wasted from more productive fields into
      mere cattle and shep herding, reducing people to animal state,
      retarding their potentials.<br>
      I could say that he mentions those ancient christians being
      "chidren of their epoch", but wasn't that teaching forming that
      epoch to its wicked texts? Isn't he himself a slave to the jews
      and now he finds himself in the position where he must justify
      something he would rather condemn? I don't know, I will return to
      this subject, anyway his lectures made me think from another angle
      on my sudden wish to reform the church. I might as well burn that
      structure to the ground with the rest of the go-t structures.<br>
      But let's begin where we started, what about those hobos and other
      retards who seem to need that faith of theirs. I don't even think
      they need it, it's just they're susceptible to deception, so it
      makes sense to create a deception we can at least try to control.
      As I was told by some other "shepherd", it's not about
      understanding the world, it's about controlling the masses. But
      that potential I spoke about are those kuraevs who had potential
      to success in something more vital.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">upd: it seems I was too kind to their low
        moral standards:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2j0p4AjA7E#t=1h03m35s "джордано
        бруно считал иначе, и в общем его правильно сожгли, так и надо"
        fuck that shit, the history of that institution and their savage
        stance averts me from ever wishing to do anything with that
        bunch of low retards whose task is to rob beggar grannies if we
        consider swindle a form of robbery, either way it's the least of
        their atrocities. It's as if they secretly serve to satan when
        they teach that world is in his hands until the second coming,
        which is an euphemism for forever. <i>Wide is the gate and
          broad is the. way that leads to destruction, and many are
          those who enter in by it</i>. In the context of the most
        popular belief system. If you received some higher truth, would
        you force people to accept it? Real truth is blessing in itself,
        if you don't want it, it's not my problem. People use force to
        make people uccept something unjust and not true. And sometimes
        they seem to play as if they don't know good from evil, as if
        that makes them qualified for Edem, and John Chrysostom tells it
        explicitly "Suppose someone slays another in accordance with
        God's will. This slaying is better than any loving-kindness. Let
        someone spare another and show him great love and kindness
        against God's decree. To spare the other's life would be more
        unholy than any slaying. For it is God's will and not the nature
        of things that makes the same actions good or bad." Which is
        there only to turn people into perfect slaves, who will perform
        for their masters any deeds, no matter how wicked. <br>
        (it is in gray, because I told it was uttered in the previous
        chapters, it is here for that deacon, whom I welcomed to read
        this very part. Sometimes I think I am a lazy suicide who wishes
        others to spare him from this retarded world, which is mostly a
        joke, but not completely. But then again why do I mess with
        those not totally sane people? Do I consider one of honest
        duties I should take? or am I also a slave of my retarded
        wishes. Let these wishes are not alcohol or tobacco, I still
        have my fair share of retarded) <br>
        <br>
        upd2: that speech of his was given in the 90s, I think,
        according to his voice and photo. There we were all psyched up,
        breaking taboos because everybdoy else did. Why am I doing it
        now? We never stopped, we just went underground? the young
        blood, who had nothing to lose. because no career to protect or
        acquire.<br>
        And I called him here what for? to say what? <font
          color="#ffffff">and because it's an update, he could have read
          it before, I hope he read it before the previous update,
          because wtf </font>He spoke of church reform, I thought of
        church reform. But church is not what I thought, it's not about
        truth, it's about control, and he opens a window into the church
        structure and tasks, he is a top university professor. He will
        be alright, he probably was set a full-time head of the internet
        department (рпц is a кгб'э's structure, because religion is an
        information technology, a virus if you wish, mind virus, as
        talking drums were invented before telegraph, so mind virii were

        infecting before computer virii appeared. Why do I use latin
        norms of grammar? grammar is grimoir? learn carma? learn

        just me guessing, but to guess is the same word as to divinate
        in russian, and that word is similar in both phonetic and
        semantic structures to divinization, which is taught by some
        book as the essence of magic, so religion is a school of
        magicians, who control the population from becoming magicians
        independently? Why are they affraid of smart people who can
        master it? Anyone can master it, and smart people who persue
        what used to be considered to be magic are not the subject for
        control, the other half of humanity is, nobody wants retards who
        think their are gods, so they're allowed to utter "созданы по
        образу и подобию" not to understand the actual sense of this
        phrase, that we're only alike like statues made of clay?
        Somebody understood what the higher entity be in comparison to
        us, and that was like a clay statue to its prototype, because we
        can only make statues of something as stupid as clay, and god
        could create humans out of some biomass, which was a heavenly
        clay, and all these are beautiful metaphor, so beautiful, that

      They both have the same source, they're clickable, and probably

      <font size="+1">A <i>RANDOM</i> CHOSEN LETTERS FROM THE
        GLAGOLITIC ALPHABET <br>
      </font><font color="#cccccc">(he removed the word RANDOM, but it's
        still preserved at pinterest where I actually found it)</font><br>
      and the right one is labled as <font size="+1">THE SIGN "TANGRA"
        WITH THE LETTERS FROM THE GLAGOLITIC ALPHABET </font><br>
      <font size="+1">The name “Tangra” has a Siberian-Altaic origin and
        means “God.” Contrary to widespread in the recent past knowledge
        for the spiritual sense of the proto Bulgarians about all
        Devine, the modern research has proved that they had believed
        not in a god called “Tangra”, but just in God, the one and only
        God. The symbol in the center of the picture is a Proto
        Bulgarian sign for God – “IYI”. It shows a deep knowledge of our
        ancestors for the space. The two open arms in the center of the
        sign directed toward the sky, the sun, from where comes
        everything necessary for the existence of life on Earth. The
        vertical lines symbolize the constant flow of energy from the
        heaven to the earth and vice versa. By the time when Constantine
        – the Philosopher had received God’s revelation to create the
        Glagolitic alphabet, the “Tangra” symbol, which had assigned the
        God, had already evolved in its earthly expression and gained
        the meaning of “I/Me”, becoming the first letter of the
        Glagolitic alphabet. With this beginning the creator of the
        alphabet had indicated that the newly created script is a
        Christian and is a gift from the God, just like everything else
        on Earth.</font><br>
      Whether what he writes is right or not, the word Tangra allowed me
      to open a whole new level related to turkic runes:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="8_files/600px-Tengrism1.svg.png" alt="" width="300"

      It's funny that I recognized the top left corner as ᛆ and right
      bottom as ᛐ (when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like
      a nail) because it's 𐱅𐰭𐰼𐰃‎, tengri (they write right to left,
      thus they read it counter-clockwise, <font color="#cccccc">like
        hebrew alphbaet goes in 231 gates, but there they go circle, so
        you're supposed to rotate the disk as if clockwise,</font> and
      with an omitted vowel, which speaks again that old-turkic runes
      were khazar. Or am I a victim to this bait, jumpoing to
      conclusions to name ever national writing system jewish in nature?
      Syllabaries seem to be more archaic, thus omitted vowels were
      normal everywhere? Both variants are possible, let's go with the
      national one, even though alphabets are probably connected, thus
      always are borrowings? But they're al different, thus it's such an
      ancient borrowing that hardly any jews existed then. Not by the
      law of Moses, but by his or their lineage, by genetic
      pecularities. It doesn't matter, or it shouldn't. Let's focus on
      the structure I research and not on extralinguistic ramble.<br>
      <br>
      My guess is neither of those ARTefacts are legit, because why
      glagolitic? and the number of squares is different no matter who
      you look at them. I think those nine in the actual tengri emblem
      is the magic square where each lines equals 15, just a guess, it
      could be lines of 123 456 789, which also has some magic to it.<br>
      <br>
      Some other tengri sign:<br>

      Speaking to a poet lady friend<br>
      <font color="#336666">Поэзия именно повторением сродни музыке
        (repetition legitimizes, как говорит Adam Neely, чей канал я
        рекомендую всем, кто интересуется музыкальной теорией:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR5yzCH5CsM) но помимо размера
        (ритма) тональность может иметь не менее важное значение, если
        предположить, что гласные когда-то соответствовали тональностям
        пентатоники.<br>
        "The vowels added by the priests of Apollo to his lyre were
        probably those mentioned by Demetrius, an Alexandrian
        philosopher of the first century BC, when he writes in his
        dissertation On Style: ‘In Egypt the priests sing hymns to the
        Gods by uttering the seven&nbsp; vowels in succession, the sound
        of which produces as strong a musical impression on their
        hearers as if the flute and lyre were used, but perhaps I had
        better not enlarge on this theme.’"<br>
        Эта цитата говорит о семи нотах, но aeiou - в гораздо большей
        степени универсальный набор (я пока нащупал лишь
        последовательность из четырёх гласных: ааааееееооооуууу знать бы
        ещё что это означает)</font><br>
      I had a thought that aeou are ^&lt;&gt;v and could it mean that
      there's no I in poetry, but there's both i &amp; я in поэзия,
      which felt like муза и я, which could state that poes is muse, for
      oe is u in dutch and п could easily be м in the past. I don't know
      if such reverlations are legit (they're definitely not scientific)
      but that's how I'm going to think of poetry from now on: it's not
      just from me, it's always together with the transcendent beings<font
        color="#cccccc"> (fiends felt to be a wrong word, and feels
        matter in these matters the most. Somehow i didn't feel wrong
        about poes thing, probably it is okay, whether it's about cats
        or pussies or the muses don't mind being associated with them,
        or pussies mew meow miaow miaou mule mewl and even waul when
        they scream. It's fascinating, because cats were (and are)
        praised in Egypt and miaows are reminding all three math, mus,
        myth)</font><br>

      But when did russians and other europeans lose their tonal nature
      of vowels? Probably, they never had it, and before humans learnt
      to play with their tone with voice, they changed the sound with
      the jaw and lips, is tongue actually jaw? Is tongue a part of
      lower jaw? Indeed so. And the fact is you don't have to move your

      It seems I'm so scared by my arrogance that I saw a dream today,
      where I took a bus and found myself at коммунистические пруды (я
      не помню как выходил с автобуса, я лишь увидел кучи крупного щебня
      поверх чернозёма, кучи крупного щебня через пару метров друг от
      друга или меньше, и я стою возле двух куч (они метра по три
      высотой, точно не помню) и воспринимаю то как стройку, и вижу на
      улице (вдимо между этими кучами, точнее не помню, реконструирую
      сон по предыдущим событиям, потому-что я не ощущал то мето как
      стройку, ощущил когда писал, увидел путина, и подумал как странно
      что он без охраны, но с другой стороны что я ему сделаю? и что бы
      я ему хотел сделать? очевидно поговорить. я безвреден? стыдил себя
      так. появляется следующий персонаж, видимо собирательный образ
      думы, зюганов может быть точно тоже не помню, это не имеет
      значение, я уже выбрал собеседника: и вопрос задал или меня
      выкинуло из сна? задам здесь (раз до рпц докопался со своими
      реформами. через одного из самых популярных попов (он сам это
      слово использует и видимо знает что это pope) <br>
      Попы попы? блин, мужик, это табуированная тема, скрой её в
      спецкхран. какой спецхран в интернете? зачем вообще тогда это

      Вопрос, который бы задал: нафига мыпротивопоставляем себя америке?
      Нас это спорт научил дурному? Противопоказния есть даже и у
      спорта, значит побочные эффекты у физтерапии тоже существуют и мы
      наткнулись на одно из них.<br>

      letter C between I&amp;l<br>

      шы is is in russian keyboard, and it's funny that though letters
      themselves don't have much in common phonetically, they come well
      as words, -s = -ы when they're plural suffices, ц = x = кс (ps,
      ks, ts - does s play like a vowel. in whisper it is. <br>
      E = 3, if B = 1, D = 2, which would be weird, why double letter
      stand for one and single letter stand for two? to equal 3 in both
      cases? and e would be just one good 3? in graphical it could be ஃ<br>
      And if ஃ is in its full 3d form, if you look at every other
      hieroglyph from a side, not top, then ஃ is 4.<br>
      D = 4 today, and the question is do the mere form of B &amp; D, of
