      A complete new source of inquiry:&nbsp;
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_drum<br>
      and the more informative piece in russian:
      https://theoryandpractice.ru/posts/8179-info100<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">(google's translator translates it better
        and better, you should be able to use it to read russian)</font><br>
      <font color="#666666">It tells of african telegraph-like
        communication with the help of drums and ancient greeks' way of
        using signal fires to transmit messages<font color="#999999">
          (thus beacons could be something more than what we thought)</font></font><br>
      <br>
      What could be the very origin of drum-communication? Probably to
      help hunters to find way home. And then they would recognize that
      something's happening if the drum beat came uneven. and now they
      say that whole complicated phrases are communicated in just the
      drum beat. Brian Eno said that afican music in the sense of rhythm
      went much further than european ever was. Europeans have every
      reason to be proud, but sometimes we're too proud to the level of
      some ignorant arrogance. <br>
      Or could those drum beats begin as a scaring technique when they
      needed to scare the predators away? Probably it was the beginning<font
        size="+1">: a man hits the water with a stick, another man asks
        him wtf he was doing, scaring the crocodiles away was the
        response, but there's no crocodiles for miles around. see, it's
        working.</font><br>

      speech, drums, horns, fires, maybe lyres were bows and.. bows were

      <br>
      arrow as a bow, you can throw it, you can shoot it, you can use it
      as a pike. pick, <br>
      pike is the metal part of the arrow<font color="#666666"> (among

      bow is –ª—É–∫, so they didn't play cords with the arrow, but with the
      bow, the horse hair bowing a stick is the bow, because it's in the
      form of a bow.<font color="#999999"> and —Å—Ç—Ä—É–Ω–æ–π could be the road
        between those ends<font color="#c0c0c0">, because it's believed
          that a potful of gold is at the end of it, but it was a lie,

      <br>
      Drum were the shields? and some mighty sticks served as the
      bangers?<br>
      <br>
      So are girls bows and arrows and guys are shields and swords?<br>
      shieled (–∑–∞—â–∏—Ç–∏–ª?)<br>
      swored(—Ä–≤–∞–ª? –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–ª? –¥—Ä–∞–ª?)<br>
      schiele is squint in german which makes me believe that shields
      were the mirrors and thus girls could use it if their simbol is
      actually a person with a mirror, as if + is mirror, becuse it's
      lines are in focus (–Ω–µ —Å–æ–≤–ø–∞–¥–∞—é—Ç, –Ω–æ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å–µ–∫–∞—é—Ç—Å—è (–≤ —Ç–æ—á–∫–µ —Ñ–æ–∫—É—Å–∞?
      they're all at the surface of the mirror, because it's not lense.
      not lance? lance could be some magic stick, so one side of it
      would be a spear, the other could be some magic stone. glass balls
      can burn fire!!! I told you that they were used as lenses to read,
      but fire, of course!!!<br>
      <br>
      lance from the one side, lense from the other one? a &amp; i as
      two forms of syllable, only two position in the consonants:
      palatalized and not. <br>
      and labialization doesn't usually matter in consonants, but it can
      influence the vowels.<br>
      <br>
      As if palatalization is from vowel i, and labialization is from
      consonant v <img src="7_files/tableau-gb.jpg" alt="" height="163"
        width="249" align="right"><br>
      <br>
      I &amp; V the first in roman (numerals)<br>
      <br>
      labialized or nasalized? m is pronounced over nose. <br>
      n is also, even though it's managed not to be labial.<br>
      nevertheless, m &amp; n are cognates, and n is probably new.<br>
      as abc it was imk I MK it is crazy.<br>
      where's l? I is l. K ~ N? ·ö¥ ~ ·öø<font color="#999999"> (because o
        is ·öÆ in unicode and upwards in Bornholm)</font> <br>
      are k &amp; n come out of ·õú?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      ê∞ñê∞ó are both [j]<br>
      ê∞ó is in Yenisei<br>
      ê∞ñ is in Orkhon<br>
      <br>
      ê∞∂ê∞∑ are their q<br>
      ê∞∑ is in Yenisei<br>
      ê∞∂ is in Orkhon<br>
      <br>
      If ê∞ó relates to ·õú I dunno, but ê∞∂ does both look and sound like ·ö≤<br>
      (if it's truly etymology or merely mnemonics I dunno as well)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      &gt; As if palatalization is from vowel i, and labialization is
      from consonant v<br>
      nasalization (the same as labialization) turns into –π–æ—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ in
      russian: —è &amp; —é are believed to be —é—Å—ã (according to –î–∞–ª—å,
      –Ω–æ—Å—ã) <br>
      So these deviations are in a sense both i's: palatalization is i
      after the letter, labialization is paradoxically also i but before
      the letter. as if –∏[i] is u (look the same in cursive)<br>
      i jklmnopq r<br>
      —É —Ñ—Ö—Ü —á<br>
      u vwx y.. ?<br>

      u vw x&nbsp; y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; z<br>
      —à—â s z <br>
      z is zed zd st (t short s aor s long t? ◊™ is reported to sound as
      Œ∏ which make it reflect Œ∏)<br>
      <br>
      Œµ Œ∂ Œ∑ Œ∏ <br>
      and that demands Œ∏ to take the place of Œ∂ so Œ∂ can be final as z
      is as –ó is in —ë–∂–∑ Œ∑ is ·öº is –ñ<font color="#cccccc">–∂</font><br>

      Œï Œñ Œó Œò <br>
      Œô Œö Œõ Œú...<br>

      Œü Œ† Œ° Œ£ Œ§ <br>
      Œ• Œ¶ Œß Œ® Œ©<br>
      are five letters per a line, not four, and these added

      Was looking for "abecedary ostracon" and the first good find is
      this:<br>
      <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27925644?seq=1"><img
          src="7_files/index.gif" alt="" border="0" height="1170"

      <font color="#999999">I hope sometimes people are not so poor that
        they place their pdfs behind the paywall or at least I am r<font

        just for the hell of it. but fuck it, I don't do it by
        ideological reasons.</font><br>
      <br>
      That ostracon uses a good method to conserving the information:
      they start with the abecedary so those who use some other font
      will be also able to read.<br>
      <br>
      It's even good that I don't see the rest of it, so I can make my
      own transliteration just to practice <br>
      <font color="#999999">(or you may)</font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      and another one:<br>

      <font size="+1">Inscription on the 'Izbet Sartah ostracon
        represents the earliest known non-cuneiform abecedary. The
        ostracon is discovered in 1976 in 'Izbet Sartah in Israel, and
        it is dated to the 12th or the early 11th century BC.<br>
        <br>
        The inscription is written by an unskilled scribe, probably a
        student, and it consists of four lines of writing exercises,
        followed by the 22 letters of the Ancient Hebrew alphabet in the
        fifth line.</font><br>

      sincerely, sensibly, in these two words first parts could be
      cognates to sign, but to tell it for sure we need some ai to feed
      all these pairs and other things. What is your aspirations in
      life? You can achieve anything in just 10 years, so a person (and
      perdaughter) can achieve several incredible goals during their
      lifetime. Are you into ai or biology or programming or music or
      where would you be?<br>
      <br>
      caught got, this kind of cognates, vocal cognates, I wonder if all
      vowel-cognates synonymous, because vowels are vocales in spanish.
      –ø–æ—Ä–∞ –¥–∞–≤–∞–π –ø–æ–∫–∞ were the first ones, and they can be cognates,
      –ø–æ–∫–∞ is bye, and –ø–æ—Ä–∞ is "it's time" and –¥–∞–≤–∞–π say for bye. So
      this mental experiment could set the borders of the vocalization
      liberties, and if fills like weak-strong stressed-unstressed
      beats, like in heart. a steady bye-bye with the second bye
      stressed. I heard of a guy who claims that intonations are the key
      to understand any language, I didn't take him seriously, but maybe
      he discovered some animal level of understanding the language. I
      will check him.<br>

      the power of ultimate honesty yet, try it accurately, recognize
      its limits: to tell truth to enemies can be dangerous, first you
      have to realize what is the truth in the world where those people

      It is just wrong. It's good I explored the possible arrangements,
      but why is it even here? <br>
      Was I surprised by three-mother-ness of ems or dollarness of dlr

      Now this is how apophenias work. It could be anything, and thus

      Those three columns from a to t are three by six, and I probably
      didn't think about it then, <br>
      and h among vowels also makes sense which I wouldn't probably see
      back then, <br>
      even though I studied japanese already. <br>

      but it does reflect the idea of g being a form of c and h coming
      the latest. <br>
      Was g the original as in original g? Because runic alphabet
      doesn't distinguish ·ö¶ into c and d.<br>
      and j &amp; h meet in ·öº which just as j can sound as h in one
      context and as short i in the other,<br>
      so h can sound as h and yet in greek it's i the way it was
      transmitted into russian, <br>
      unless they took it directly from ugaritic êéä or egyptian ìáå(ìè≠)<br>
      I don't like how m stands out of labials, but it's nothing new.<br>
      I especially don't like how f stands out of that column, but that
      could be the reason behind greek Œ∏.<br>
      Either way what's about E? Is it why it's consonantalized in
      arabic? <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">In greek z is the final of the first column,
        which demands me to ponder on it in greek:<br>
        <br>
        Œë Œí Œì Œî Œï Œñ <br>
        Œó Œò Œô Œö Œõ Œú Œù Œû <br>

        Œë Œí Œì Œî Œï Œñ <br>

        I dunno, it doesn't seem to lead anywhere, the first case of 6 8
        10 was the most interesting, even though it also didn't have
        much of symmetry between it's neighbours. and even those other
        three wouldn't help.<br>
        See, returning to the old notebooks is a waste of time. I was so
        worried about my drafts (and I probably should, but let some
        other people or machines look into that whatever.</font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      About those intonations, melodic patterns as information:<br>
      –ø–æ–∫–ê, –¥–∞–≤–ê–π, –ø–∏–∑–¥–£–π, –ª–µ—Ç–ò, bye-bYe, /<br>
      but<br>
      –æ—Å—Ç–ê–Ω—å—Å—è, stay hEar, ^<br>
      as if / is waving goodbye, and ^ is waving welcome.<br>
      –æ—Ç—Å—Ç–ê–Ω—å, but –æ—Å—Ç–ê–Ω—å—Å—è<br>
      as if the final syllable is not sya, but not.<br>
      Pronouns are often antonimous towards itself (in different
      languages)<br>
      Can yes/no go like that? can sya be no event though si is yeah?<br>
      like what's the difference between hai &amp; nai in japanese? <br>
      is it the same letter but h is upwards, and Œº is down?<br>
      but "how do you do" has the same melody as "–Ω–∞—Ö—É–π –∏–¥–∏" or do those
      i &amp; u make all the difference? <br>
      I think that work is done, so why should I w√•nder? To make an
      independent research to compare afterwards? I doubt this flow
      delivers me to the my goal in in all: to recognize all the
      morphemes.<br>
      Let's begin with building a map of only pronouns, it's a simpler
      task and those alone could connect to tribes names and the gods
      they worshiped. Read the first knitten notebook for more detail.
      or that's it.<br>
      how do you do is more like —Ö–∞–≤–∞–π –µ–¥—É<br>

      That piece of the bell is from the russian public opposition to
      official academia, it's here not because I immediately see
      something in it, <font color="#cccccc">but because it was in a
        film about anbur my friend and colleague who helped me with .odo
        have shown me, and I also want to collect all the writing
        systems, even invented writing systems deserve being preserved
        for history as clouds around tree of writing systems,
        simultaneous with the language tree. now back to the black text:</font>
      only why didn't they teach us that? why would they drive us crazy?
      also nationalism and separatism are felonies in putin's russia,
      pr, P as rusia's torch at olimpics:<br>
      <img
src="7_files/olympic-torch-relay-miniature-sochi_1_931600edaf31058a49ff30d173aedb3d.jpg"
        alt="" height="750" width="1000"><br>
      For russians it's –† in –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è, for foreigners it's P in Putin, so
      I may only hope that next will be navalny because n is –ø in –ø—É—Ç–∏–Ω
      (doubtful foreigner, see the cursive forms) that <font
        color="#cccccc">sosni zain—Ü—É's another story.</font><br>
      Even though I recognize another jew in navalny, they play us like
      children, but their games brought me the understanding of some
      bond between several letters:<br>
      n-–ø-p-—Ä-r-–≥-g-–¥-d-D-and back to ·ö¶ and —Ä and p<br>
      g-–¥ - see russian cursive to understand (same as with m-—Ç further
      on)<br>
      <br>
      let's find the other raws like that to see if this game even
      plays:<br>
      b-B-–í-v-u-–∏-–ò-–ù-h-n-ŒΩ<br>
      <br>
      b&amp;d are supposed to be the opposites, but they meet at n, but
      they also meet in roman cursive, where they both look in he
      d-side, only –ë (there flipped to the left) has a longis-kind just
      as ·õí is double ·ö¶.<br>
      <br>
      M-m-—Ç-T the weirdest yet thoroughly separated from BD, so that is
      how it is? Bd and mT<br>
      That is ultra funny, because they look like Majuscule and
      minuscule forms of Bb and T<i>—Ç</i><br>
      Oh wow, no need to see cursive tables, <i>—Ç</i> is officially the
      italic form of —Ç.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      little form of B could be farting sound or was –í [v] as that
      russian letter is, and B [b] is its english form.<br>
      but then it doesn't explain how d is a small B other than ·ö¶ is a
      half of ·õí<br>
      Was it semantic notation instead of phonetic one? Two lips, but
      only one tongue.<br>
      T<i>—Ç</i> contradicts –ü–ø a little bit, because in cursive standart
      (—É—Å—Ç–æ—è–≤—à–µ–µ—Å—è –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ? fole etymology) <br>
      see again:<br>
      <img src="V_files/456px-Cyrillic_cursive.png" alt="" height="600"
        width="456"><img src="img/484.png" alt="" height="468"
        width="525"><br>
      it's as if –ü–¢ challenge the order of MN, as if –ü is M and thus n
      is m and N... error, error, building of a sand, guessing too far,
      bridge doesn't want to appear, or I simply panicked, but it's
      something to ponder on that's for sure, only if this cursive isn't
      cursed, because it delivers some mindfucks, like why –¥ looks like
      g? and why –ø lookls like english n, and especially why —Ç looks
      like english m now? <br>
      I'm not sure I placed these two sides by side, I must be sure I do
      when I combine it in different books.<br>
      <br>
      According to that right image, —á/—Ü is like —à/—â, even though the
      order doesn't support it, compare the majuscule forms, ‚∞Ä‚∞Å‚∞Ç‚∞É‚∞Ñ of
      –∞–±–≤–≥–¥ shows how free russians are about hight of such elements: –≤
      &amp; –¥ oppose eachother completely in the other font of theirs,
      where bubbles on them are all like the last one.<br>
      <br>
      How reliable a source the russian alphabet? al russian regimes
      were rather ominous, so ominous that the current cleptocracy seems
      as one of the best ones, so shitty they govern us here. So wasn't
      russian writing mutilated to fuck us up especially: like russian
      cursive fucks us up, why would –î &amp; –¥ look differently in
      cursive, and they both look differently, but especially <i>–¥</i>
      (that's italic –¥, but it goes <i>g</i> way too, which is
      especially f-ed-up, but probably refers to ·ö¶)<br>
      <br>
      Back to that bell. Not that it has anything to do to my research,
      but it's a language thing, and as in the television manner when
      they feed the viewers some based stuff and then add some atrocious
      bs, I feel it to be my duty to take a good care of that piece I
      never even knew about. As I said, that misterious script isn't
      permian, but what is it, Here let me link a good article about it:
      https://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/ruwiki/505332 (<a

      <font color="#cccccc">(it's like six different cyphres one after
        another, check the link above to see if it's okay. there they
        admit, that some mistakes are made, and that mistakes are
        considred by that freaky opposition to be evidence of the
        translation being false, but they could be explained by the
        artists not knowing that script (as it used to happen with
        chinese manuals in russian before the internet got better) and
        the tzar himself, who probably inspected the forms before the
        cast could be unable to read them without the tables of his)</font><br>
      <br>
      I took that episode close to heart, because I saw one of my
      discoveries used by somebody else (and I cannot patent history or
      to let other people use it, but I told myself that they will
      attach to it shitload of their own shit, and those this bell thing
      is an interesting curiousity, it is probably work of art of the
      tzar of the occupiers, it has probably has nothing to do to
      writings of the conquered nations, it's just some high-ranking
      retard having fun. I refuse to keep on digging into that episode
      for now, I only keep it here because of that n-<i>–ø-p-why doesn't
        that p go more –≥-like or rather</i> –≥-like (that first one is
      just in italic)<br>
      but to my surprise that <i>–≥</i> would look like what I was
      looking for if you placed it instead of …î in p.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">yeah, because of that being stuck in this
        part, and it's also freaky in its way, maybe even freakier</font><br>
      –ëd and –ü<font color="#cccccc">M</font><i>—Ç</i> is a great
      breakthrough, so why worry if some people spread my thought the
      way they can, it still get out there, I can catch it later, I also
      can prove that I was first (if Fomenko didn't say it first. I
      contacted both him and Nosovsky, because I referred to them and
      not only in the freaks.html, so they could take it from that first
      volume (but I backed it up just in such a case, or if they spoke
      about it before me, then I should stick my —á—Å–≤ into my own. I
      don't really care, but I do. not really. yes. but not too much.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#999999">·õÜ·õí·ö¶ would make more sense if d was a
        consonant form of a (as if they both were da, the one syllable
        of some prehistoric syllabary) then it would go 1212121212.. and
        just as ·õí is double ·ö¶, so ·öæ is double ·õÜ and thus again e ~ o
        (because aa is o, but it makes more sense if aa= o, oo=u, but
        then again ee=i, so does it say that u = i? which is strange,
        because <i>–∏</i> [i] in russia.<br>
        but why ·ö†·öµ follows ·öæ if ·öæ is already doubel? 12122120 it all
        doesn't look right, and thus my guess is wrong. or was there a
        letter between ·öæ and ·ö† or I'm making it up? I most probably do.
        It's time to go work on my capsule, but I'm a commonner and
        don't just dare or what, please god reprogram me, I must build
        that immortality capsule, it's not enough to just know the way,
        one must also walk the walk. Please! Gods! Muses! Superstars!
        All make me mighty and powerful so I use this might for good.</font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      So, in conclusion of this freaky day, I must say that language
      enthusiasts who are looking for russian scripts are desperate,
      because they grasp every straw, but ignore the based glagolythic
      script, for whether ertza (zyryan, komi, parmic) script is ancient
      or not, it isn't russian <font color="#cccccc">(even though it
        could be a criminal thing to say, as a free scientist I must.)</font>
      There were writing systems on the territory of Russia before
      christians, because it's impossible that they wasn't, because the
      fashion for national writing systems was universal. Whatever, the
      possibility maps will be built with some advanced computing
      powers, I only set the vectors, the fractals will be drawn by the
      other beings.<br>
      <br>
      Why didn't I dig in into that knitting stuff, I found it and as if
      left interest to it immediately, and that is how I usually work: I
      discover something, I let it lay, if it matters I return to it. or
      am supposed to.<br>
      <br>
      but one final chord:<br>
      The city where that bell used to be is called zvenigorod
      (toll-city) and for whatever reason their emblem is like that,
      with 88 in the centre of some seamingly meaningless text:<br>

      So I guess the first incident of somebody using my research (if we

      translated my separatistic tendencies further the knoosphere with

      being completely different system, surprisingly L O and T are the
      same, and some other letters demonstrate similar meaning (if the
      mining is in the fingers themselves, compare E, F, M, N, P, S, Z,
      especially look at how there are two R's in the second one, so
      these three variants are as if R occupies two fingers, and you can
      press any of them or both. Why is it here? To make it clear. It
      makes it more complicated, but it's here to clarify the first of
      these two: It's as if it counts fingers FGHI from index to pinky,
      L is similar to G which reminds me a lot, MNO simply draw the
      letters in air, on both tables so, PQRST counts fingers back from
      pinty to thumb or rather it's as if it's FGHPQRST, notice how o
      reminds s as if it's œÉ (Q could be the nameless finger, but then
      not to confuse it to R, R doesn't need thumb and Q is modified too
      to make it clear. Hh &amp; –´ are the other uses of this simbol, as
      if for Horns and for drawing the letter in the air, like those MNO
      are. Now I wonder if those 15 letters are 14 falangs and the whole
      fist for later-induced A?<br>

      observation, hypothesis, experimentation, theory, communication,
      replication<br>
      <br>
      and now I apply it to my work and I see some irregularities:<br>
      I experimented with hypotheses I got during my observations of the
      language: armenian regained the link to the structure I've
      onserved when I digged depper in the past (in Mashtots's students
      memoirs)<br>
      <br>
      So now I must build my theory, but theory began growing further. I
      had hypothesis that the structure is universal, so I observed
      (during the "experiments") the other languages and explained all
      the irregularities (greek myth writes of 2 vowels added to the 5)
      only M is not explained properly, but what is Œñ and Œò then? ŒïŒñ/ŒóŒò
      are invariant pair as in OP/QR and in russian after –ó(Z) goes –ò(I)
      as if Z is the final, and I is digits, 1I 2J 3K 4L 5M 6N they're
      tens, 7O but 8 fits O much more, but in hebrew 1i 2k 3l 4m 5n 6o

      s is sto (hundrend)<br>

      tsadi is z)<br>
      100 is q 200r 300s 400t + 5soFits (co Fin's)<br>
      q and a are similar in latin, in cursive hebrew it's as if stick
      around a curve siply stands at the other side, and then yod is
      that curve? It's observation, but what it's hyposesis is? Hebrew
      ones tens hundreds somehow reflect each other? Let's see it in
      others bet, kaf, rush, all are very similar graphicaly, but almost
      three mothers in phonetic structure, it could be another guess,
      but a i q don't play this way, unless I recognize some form of p
      or —Ñ - let's go on with the previous hypothesis<br>
      gimel, lamed, shin - gimel and lamed are very close in this work,
      I observed their similarities many times (mostly graphical, but
      2's are also only graphically alike, but what is shin! completely
      different, but if it was S, lamed is very similar, and s is
      related to c.<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      So let's start that good topic again:<br>
      observation, hypothesis, experimentation, theory, communication,
      replication<br>
      Justus didn't explain it, but I can say it myself, that theory is
      a complex of hypotheses, confirmed by the experiments (by the
      further observations, observation is always present, or at least
      in every second step? because hypothesis is made with the
      observations we already acquired, without looking at the
      randomness of the rest of the world, or is it just that additional
      observation, that allows a break-through of a good hypothesis? So
      observation is surely exist in experimentation, but building of a
      theory is again the thought process, only it works not with
      observations, but with hypotheses, observing the hypotheses about
      the subject of the theory. Communication is observation of that
      theory by the other people, replication is experiments they make
      (they observe the language with my theory in mind to see if they
      can find the contradictions to it)<br>
      I knew why I communicated it too early, at the stage of acquiring
      the hypotheses, before the theory was built. But that mistake lead
      to something good: now I can show my site to my investors so they
      see I'm not just some crazy pothead, but that I actually work on a
      problem or two.<br>
      So now I made it a race, I'm a racian, racist, racer, chaser, rats
      chat rock choke jewels rules) <br>
      <br>
      parallelly to this text go notebooks (second (third of two)
      knitten notebook tells of !? being ab, yes no, and so on<br>
      Those notebooks mostly have observations, but also hypothesis, so
      I have to feed them all to an ai which would build to me the links
      between the observations and hypotheses to make me see if it leads
      to a theory. The larger hypothesis, that all morphemes are
      universal, will be guaranteed a theory while I have a head large
      enough to build it, to collect all the possible morphemes in a
      moment. Most of my observations are comparing different morphemes
      if they click or not. a net of false (failed by experiment
      hypotheses should be also built, separately from the main,
      confirmed ned of observations (see if it connects into a net at
      all)<br>
      A lot of work is to be done. I make it online, which is awesome, I
      died to see drafts of the guys I read as a teenager, I guess some
      young blood is lurking around gulping this honey or smoke.<br>

      C in some form is present in all the alphabet, except that norsk

      Three goddesses are known - brits have more of ass than rus have
      cacs - also in non-jewish middle-east as Allat Manat and al-Uzza,
      which allowed me to put Uzza first, because al of allat could be
      also an article, that allowed me to declare them three mothers as
      Uzza Manat alLat, as if Uzza was winter and autumn in one piece,
      Lat would be l'ete - french guys have similar article, is it why
      they merge with arabs, frencha and spanninsh are visuably darker
      than the north. It is another form of subjugation, slow and <font

      Doesn't that Allat look like a cross-dresser to you? A son dressed
      as a woman to protect them, and if such a priest plays in the
      temple, nobody understands how they give births without grooms,
      was it followed or preceded by the taboo on genitalia
      demonstrations? Those priests probably discovered shaving first,
      so they fooled the public. And "her" hat reminds te one of Mitra,

        height="809" width="877"><br>
      I thought to search for Allat and Mitra in one sentence, and what
      I found:<br>
      <font size="+1">The Assyrians call Aphrodite Mylitta, the Arabians
        Alilat [Greek spelling: ·ºàŒªŒπŒªŒ¨œÑ], and the Persians Mithra.</font><br>
      <font color="#cccccc">and there are more:<font size="+1"><br>
          They believe in no other gods except Dionysus and the Heavenly
          Aphrodite; and they say that they wear their hair as Dionysus
          does his, cutting it round the head and shaving the temples.
          They call Dionysus, Orotalt; and Aphrodite, Alilat. (wiki:
          Herodouts, Histories I:131)</font></font><br>
      I used to think this to be a young woman whose tits are not show<font
        color="#cccccc">n</font>, but I was gay myself to think it's a
      woman, the very same accompanying figures could be at the corners
      of the bas-relief. Snake and scorpio could indicate that this
      cross-dresser used poison on his knife to easily kill a bull, a
      female way of doing murder, so it's a prince grown up by the
      mother and grandmother or a mother and a wife? A family unit,
      women demand families, guys would rather walk –≥—É–ª—è–ª–∏ (–∫ –ª—è–ª–µ)
      –≥—É–ª—è—Ç—å (to –±–ª—è—Ç—å) but that's poetry more than science<br>
      See how at the previous image, the one before the bull, where the
      three "divas" are above a lion, there the c<font color="#cccccc">o</font>entral











      figure (Allat) is larger than other two, and has no tits.<br>

      <br>

      <br>
      Not knowing what to write on a next session, I wandered around
      pictures and found this magic:<br>
      <img src="7_files/ginfaxi.jpg" alt="" height="720" width="1280"><br>
      <font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two staves, kept in the
        shoes, gapaldur under the heel of the right foot and ginfaxi
        under the toes of the left foot, to magically ensure victory in
        bouts of Icelandic wrestling (gl√≠ma).[citation needed]</font><br>
      So the left one was under the right foot and the right one under
      the left, let's remake it.<br>
      <img src="7_files/ginfaxi__gapaldur.jpg" alt="" height="1457"
        width="1112"><br>
      <br>
      They look as if the heel of the right foot was told to hold, and
      the 24 ends could be corresponding 24 runes<font color="#cccccc">,
        even though a second ago I counted them falsely as 32 and
        corresponded them with 32 teeth. I have only 28 teeth (26
        already, but if we calculate the hidden wisdom teeth, they will
        total into more than 28, but less then 32 (I probably have 3
        wisdom teeth, maybe one was stolen when I was a kid, or they say
        teeth can migrate into the skull, so that cancer with a tooth I
        heard of could be a tooth growing into some anomaly, what are
        these crazy stories, scary stories, Anyway, the right bottom
        sign looks as if it's told to hold up. And the left upper one is
        commanding a rotation. the question which way this swastika
        rolls is present, because my first guess is that it's "–∑–∞—Ç—É—à–∏—Ç—å
        –æ–∫—É—Ä–æ–∫"-movement, and when I think of that wrestling part of the
        story, it could be a command to kick, as if those are 16 to 24
        legs kicking by feet and by knee, or there are only 12 feet and
        other waves are something else.</font><br>
      I confess that I have no idea which artefact contains a futhark of
      24 runes, I just took this number on faith. <br>
      <img src="img/pic_seax02-auto_width_251.jpg" alt="" height="126"
        width="1255"><br>
      From a far I counted 27<br>
      <img src="7_files/futhark(24-bit_Color).png" alt="" height="52"
        width="1459"><br>
      could be 28, but I still think that rune is –´<br>
      I'm probably wrong and there are 29, I need to see the artefact in
      other pictures and the canon in other examples.<br>
      <br>
      That Ginfaxi - could it be a quadripled binderunen of EWO or ŒïŒ£Œü
      or ŒüŒ£Œï or.. EWOME.. But I see that E dictates the only reading
      EWO. What it means I can only guess. In wrestling it could be –ï–ì–û
      [evo] even though –≥[g] if you didn't get it yet. Even though
      russians don't have W, but –ì following –í[v]<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Look at this wonderful gothic futhark, which is a transitional
      link between runes and letters.<br>
      Look&nbsp; how ·ö¶ looks like –§, just as —≤—≥ŒòŒ∏ could. <br>

        src="img/035.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="141" align="right"><br>
      Then ·ö¶ is closer to P and thus first line of bornholm alphabetic
      runestone is all labials. Which reminds the egyptologic
      abecedaries, and demands me to go on, <font color="#ff0000">.</font>BP<font
        color="#ff0000">.</font>F<font color="#ffcc33">.</font>H so that
      only M&amp;W are outside of the labial claster, just as in the

      In the folder where I took, they are both named goty, thus they
      are different periods of Gothic.<br>

      Heptarchia leads to some magical domain of John Dee, but whhat is

      not, such werds are cretin and –∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—å—è–Ω–∏–Ω maybe too, or maybe not,

        the guidance of the angel Uriel and contains diagrams and
        formulae.[1] </font><br>

        color="#cccccc">h</font>er<font color="#cccccc">e</font> Œ† or Œ°
      is abundant or is it just a chaos speaking nonsence? because the
      labials and vowels don't confirm it or does it tell of ·õÜ<font
        color="#3333ff">·õí</font>·ö¶·öæ before Z<font color="#3333ff">F</font>,
      but it doesn't make not sense, because in runes there's no Z in
      there, and in greek it's told that F stands before Z. So it's
      probably nothing, a wrong lead.<br>

      I think I already mentioned the following image, but I sort my
      downloaded pictures again, and this one worth repeathing, because
      I didn't notice the planet and days correspondence to the runes<br>
      <img src="7_files/i_029.jpg" alt="" height="420" width="400"><br>

      My secret wish to collect all the writing&nbsp; systems, ancient
      and modern, allows me to add something that I consider to be a
      modern development, at least the article under that picture tells
      that it's new. And I see some chinese influence in it, China is
      big in Africa today.<br>
      <a href="https://blog.nsibiri.org/search/label/Akagu"><img

      Not much of china in that table, but if you click it, you may find
      this video, showing how nsbidi is used for Igbo, I'll even add
      that video here:<br>

      Look how man and woman are divided into two phases of the moon,
      and those are clockwise and counterclockwise curves, so that is
      all very yin-yang, which makes me think how deep that system go.<br>
      and another table of the same:<br>

      How can i know that it isn't a stylization? I keep it here because
      it looks like gold, and runes are ok, and it's just some writing
      on a language I don't know either it's genuine or not. It doesn't
      matter, just decors.<br>

        If we see how C equals 3, we may guess what could -2 be, if B is

        and such candidate Makes O equal -1, which is wheird, <br>
        because unless zero can be ◊°, it doesn't make much sense.<br>
        and if ◊° is 0, ◊¢ is -1, ◊§ is -2, ◊¶ is that S which is -3, does
        this joke still holds? probably not, keep on,<br>
        ◊ß is -4, ◊® is -5, ◊© is -6, ◊™ is -7, which is funny, because t

      further digging through the random pictures delivers tarot
      symbols, let's look further into them:<br>
      <img src="7_files/d21a1da68b0cabb23237a2e8cf0d6712.jpg" alt=""

      as we can see, three pictures, three completely different systems
      (maybe something among them is universal, and thus more true,
      we'll look at them later, here's some theorizing comes (the
      clickable one)<br>
      <a href="https://dahniwitchoflight.tumblr.com/post/161090047157"><img

          border="0" height="642" width="500"></a>as you can see if you
      click it, it's rather arbitrary,<br>
      but sword is as in the other two out of three, but wands is
      completely different, but the way wands are similar in those other
      three tells me that they could be some actual traditions,
      connected at some points, so we can see the layers to it, just
      like deaf sing abecedaries are different, but they all are actual.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      This one may correlate with the following one. And it does
      correlate in the sense of uroboros being an abecedary, I think I
      came to this thought before, I will figure it out when I sort out
      these pages in themes.<br>

      Even in the readable scale this alchemy doesn't make much sense:
      Why would mare &amp; terra oppose not fire and air, but what is
      Ros Pluvia? it's –†–æ—Å–∞ –î–æ–∂–¥—å (Dew Rain) in latin. Either way, I
      didn't manage to find the explanation, I probably should dig for
      the book this image is taken from, so tiresome.. Animalia
      Vegetabilia Mineralia<br>
      That hindu yantra reminds the fleur de vie I showed in the
      previous volume with its lapels, even then it has only 8 and the
      flower has 12 or 24, and why it's here is that 6-corner-like-ness
      of the fleur de vie:<br>

      ìÄÄ [i] and it looks like –ò [i]<br>
      where I found it:
      https://www.pyramidtextsonline.com/documents/DicksonDictionary.pdf
      (<a href="mirrors/Egyptian_DicksonDictionary.pdf"><font
          color="#000000">mirror</font></a>)<br>
      there they say that ìÑø can be not only A, but also tiw (which is
      extremely strange, taw as three mothers? nah, trippin, I asked
      this at some egyptologists' forum I will edit it if they explain)<br>
      upd: I found the answer myself, in the wiki about ìÑø: This glyph
      should not be confused with the extremely similar tyw (ìÖÇ), which
      serves as a phonogram for tjw and has a more rounded back of the
      head. In some inscriptions the two could also be distinguished by
      their colors. That bird in brackets are some different birdie, but
      unicode makes it look like the same, there are two or three
      unicode forms:<br>
      <img src="7_files/egyptian_birds.png" alt="" height="228"
        width="1105"><br>
      <img src="7_files/egyptian_birds..png" alt="" height="134"
        width="240"><br>
      all these are ìÑøìÖÇ in different programs: searchbar,
      googletranslate, kolourpaint, wikipedia<br>
      So again, if the ìÖÇ is just some abstract bird, it can unite all
      three ìÑøìÖ±ìÖì literally aum, and I was theorizing today in the 2nd
      knitten notebook (it's the third, but only have 1 &amp; 3) that ‡•ê
      if read in aramic manner is ma, which can be the sacral sound much
      more (knowledge was sacralized (covered, —Å–æ–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–æ)) ma is "with" in
      arabic, which made sense (or was that some parralel sense, it's
      also in that notebook) that deva = dva (girls go in pairs, so they
      hav chance to prevail in a fight and sex with two girls is
      funnier.<br>
      <br>
      milch is another form of milk (in english, a german word)<br>
      ìÄÄ [i] I (me, my) <br>
      Êàë also could be a form of <br>
      ‰∏Ä‰∏ñ [ishi] which looks like "i —ài" (their 1 is ‰∏Ä[i in chinese, in
      japanse it's ichi, but chi is probably a suffix, but maybe not: ‰∏Ä„Å§
      is hitotsu, so hit<font color="#cccccc">o</font> is ich<font
        color="#cccccc">i</font>])<br>
      ÂÄç is "double" and sounds as bei (I'm lost again, intimidated by
      the corpus of knowledge I need to integrate to achieve it: some
      words like elephant would be left behind until I learn greek or
      wherever that word is from, but I think we have enough of common
      words to make english - russian cognates dictionary the way that
      guy unites them, he probably made the most of this job, I am
      scared to look further, he's weird. Dragunkin is his name, he's a
      freaky kid, but rather powerful, where he's correct, he's correct
      alright)<br>
      <br>
      ìÖÇ[tiw] looks quite like dove in the rightmost representation of
      it <font color="#cccccc">(the same unicode is shown in html of
        wiki, those other two are from wiki<font size="-1">„ÅÆ</font>
        png's) </font>and tiw reminds dove a lot. it's also close to
      ptitsa, but only occasionally, it's much more some ch-like click
      people use to imitate birds when call them to eat seeds.<br>

      one of my book's names is the BOOK, which is similar to –±–æ–≥, which
      correlates to bible's role (they say bible is simply a book) as if
      it's baal, the lord, and also as baal was a, and bible is variant
      b of the same.<br>
      baal to babel as belle to baby or is baal dieu baal, the devil,

      The way both turkic and hungarian share many letters with norman
      runes, but only a couple of signs shared between turkic and
      hungarian are not also shared with the norman runes. Which may
      show that norman runes are the parent writing system, yet either
      way the common part of the letters are the basis to understand the
      proto-runic (the predating one to these relatively modern writing
      systems, the older runes, older than both new and old futhark
      whichever which is not that important on that scale)<br>

      <font color="#cccccc">though these two sets ar probably of

        same signs in different cells, which tells it's all not certain
        (and different people pronounce the same sounds differently) and
        unnecessary when audio-recordings is widely available (but not
