        of letters having one(?) to five(?) semantic meanings it can
        take in different words, dare I say, correct? That was a good
        classification of language by semantics, it was an awesome work
        I read in the 90s I think, though I put it away when he began
        building his lexics, because I wanted to make it myself,
        independently, so I could compare my findings to his dictionary.

      With these two raw aſf but neverthe less dictionaries to what
      kessler theorized and thus to Kessler<a
        href="mirrors/Ya_A_Kesler_Azbuka_i_russko-evropeyskiy_slovar.pdf"><font
          color="#000000">'</font></a>s:.<br>
      but no, let some ai (artificial or augmented intelligence) does it
      afterwards, because I tried to find алый in his Ъ groups, and I
      couldn't find it. I would place it whether in Ъ6 next to fire
      (look at the very end of the book to see his rationalization of
      fire being with Я) or to Ъ18 next to ярый (яркий, эти группы
      связаны и не понятно умышленно или случайно, и не известно что
      страшней, ууууу)<br>
      <br>
      so I put a mirror to his book at that previous ' in case the link
      in the one before it dies, because it's an outstanding work,
      whether it is correct or not, and it would be a bummer if it's
      lost, because it could be the biggest loss in that Fomenko
      scandal, when some historic works were made by mathematician and
      published in the most prominent soviet university and later
      historic department labelled them as pseudoscientific (look who's
      talking!) but failing to attach any constructive criticism to his
      work for at least three years (I was watching that situation
      closely) maybe even five (so long ago it was, that my memory is
      not sure about this digit in it) and only after let's say 3 to 5
      years an engineer or a mathematician (memory also doubts what
      version is true) began public intellectual battle with Fomenko,
      and I wasn't able to follow their conversation, because whether
      their argumentations required some level of competence I didn't
      feel like achieving educating myself, or just the interest to this
      situation faded with time, because what the situation taught me is
      that fuck academia, those clerks don't know shit, so I was
      liberated to begin my work from scratch without leaning onto the
      academia speers. And the same rationalization could be beyond
      Kessler's attempt to group all the dictionary into lesser semantic
      groups without bringing reconstructed forms and structures made
      before them (they can always be wrong, and me personally, I don't
      believe in established language families, because of how russian
      and japanese are similar. If I want to preserve the family
      structure which is wide accepted today, I should attach japanese
      to slavic languages, but it would be so insane and actually why
      not to combine chinese to english because of some similarities? wo
      &amp; we and short words and simple grammar, that probably were
      the two huge branches we initially were on, but cross-culture
      communications made russian drift further from japanese and closer
      to english, just as japanese drifted towards chinese, so it's not
      a tree, but a jar or aminoacids the way I imagine it.<br>
      But after saying all that I decide to not dig into his theory
      until I develop my own dictionary and let it be better than his,
      with much less semantic clasters.<br>
      I dare to mention Fomenko more and more explicitly in these texts
      probably because I grew more hostile towards academia, but also
      because a friend of mine mentioned him as a freak not worth
      mentioning and I asked him why exactly doesn't he like what he
      said, and I couldn't receive a coherent answer to that, he simply
      accepted that academia is always right. Even though history of
      science here and again prove otherwise.<br>
      So about the freaks, we should distinguish between them: there are
      obvious freaks like Chudinov who's probably there to smear some
      authentic artifacts like that Bornholm alphabet runestone; then
      there are those freaks who are whether fools or trolls like
      Oreshkin; then there are some clinically insane freaks like
      Lukashevich. Those evaluations are purely subjective, but they
      allow to understand where I stand.<br>
      The other group of linguistic freaks are Vashkevich and Dragunkin,
      who pull some outrageous conclusions out of their observations,
      but the observations itself may be rather useful for those who
      learn foreign languages (Vashkevich compare arabic words to greek,
      russian and whatever else, I didn't even read him. Dragunkin
      compares russian to japanese and to english. All that can be
      incredibly useful as mnemonic tools) <br>
      Fomenko also belongs to that second group of semi-correct
      scientific marginals, and the most prominent reason of his
      theories not being taken serious (I'm not even talking of them
      being accepted) is that he doesn't have historian education. But
      seriously, if prominent mathematicians use some previously
      published tools and models to the structure of historic data, that
      alone demands a proper outlook from scientific society, which
      didn't happen when he was relatively alright, and now there's even
      less chance of that being done properly, for that guy whether went
      trolling or was sold out or whatver happened to him, that the
      level of his scientific thought dropped from mathematical
      modelling to mere speculations. Or it could be because it's easier
      to notice what is wrong with the state of affair happening at the
      moment, but one has ever-growing tendency to fall short when (s)he
      tries to describe as it was or what's supposed to be done in the
      future. Me myself, I'm definitely in that second group of freaks,
      and some of my assumptions are probably dead wrong, but those main
      elements of this theory the structures and some other findings may
      persist and sustain. And I actually except some academic
      recognition in the following three years or so. Even though I was
      recently told that <font size="+1">Ignaz Semmelweis was
        disregarded for awhile because MDs are psychopaths: see
        Semmelweis effect. Gregor Mendel's founding of genetics was
        completely ignored for thirty something years </font>I began
      that path believing that anything can be achieved in mere ten
      years, also they say history goes faster than before, so I expect
      it to take society ten years to recognize what it's all about. And
      it's been over six years now since I went public, so..<br>

        justified, but as I said in the very beginning, some of them are
        alright, some of them are very alright, but i don't know any
        very alright individual in linguistics, even myself is too weird
        to be a king, and above whom? fuck them, gosh. But they milk

        military actions agains us ineffective? they are not interested,

      See how halaḥam follow the tradition I've seen first in Arabic
      vowel diacritics:<br>
      unlike philippines writing system make it, here u gets a high
      mark, and i gets a low mark, which would be more natural for me as
      a child (elephant is high, so why his sound is low? and mouse is
      visa versa)<br>

      <img src="img/141.png" alt="" width="378" height="404"><br>
      But here we see why it could be: in philippines the order is AIU,
      and this one is the other order, and it makes these writing
      systems related to ogham of all things, which could be related to
      some berber ancients. The following research is needed, and it's
      time to add english version of colored ge'ez to vol.1.<br>

      This time I also noticed what I misse the first time (other than
      хы хо во in ge'ez part) the other b-line, in the final row of ኀ:
      not only ጰ, but also some ፐ which is out of the structure, and yet
      to be archeologized in the archives of ethiopean philology.<br>
      <br>
      (that piece I copy-pasted from vol.1 where I just put it. well, at
      least for those who missed this edition, because he reads vol.2 or
      3 when I update vol.1<br>
      And more than that to speak more about it not overcomplicating
      vol.1 with this autism:<br>
      <br>
      ሀ and በ oppose each other as a opposes б if you can see it. and we
      were talking of b reflecting d this way, but a &amp; d are
      probably historically the same letter, then e is c, o is ?, u is
      v=в=b, and we return to A reflecting V which is D reflecting B, I
      hope you follow this.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc"><br>
        And suddenly.. halaḥam, ogham (both has u's before i's)<br>
        ham is a rude person in russian (хам) <br>
        so does it make cultures that let i's (thin people, ladies(?))
        front more civilized? than those where big ones go first because
        it's better not to stand on their way: if they fall on you it
        may be a naughty knock-out. only guessing, hardly scientific is
        this guess, but hypotheses do belong scientific literature, I
        already said why, they can be proven or disproven by the reader.
        They also remind the reader, that some scientific information is
        not valid, even when it is displayed arrogantly certainly it can
        be false or wrong.</font><br>
      <br>
      I speak of someting important and on the same breath I speak of
      something hardly right or important, at least I can put it into
      grey. <font color="#cccccc">and it was here before I copypasted
        that vol.1 thing + its autism, so it's not on the same breath</font><br>
      <br>
      ሀ (a) turning into ሁ (u) in its diacritic form could be an attempt
      to notify u when it comes out of a and into u as it is bሀs, but
      abሁse. or it could be some other story, but actually I came here
      to say that in this ሀ both a &amp; u meet, it could be from those
      time when A &amp; U wasn't separated, but that sets an important
      question of how would people distinguish speech if so many now
      different things were the same.<br>

      The beginning of this volume will always want me to do something
      else, so embarrasing it is.<br>
      But I keep on digging, because sometimes some treasures appear.<br>
      <br>
      I also write in my notebooks (another portion of scans is coming
      in several months only, when the summer comes, I don't want to go
      there before that)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Russian orthography is made up by the germans (and etymology too)
      yet<br>
      if we write russian word for blue not the way they tell us, but
      the way we speak it, it's синии, сини is also that word (a short
      form of it) thus that reminds very much egyptian 𓏭 and 𓏼
      standing in egyptian grammar for a suffix of plural form.<br>
      <br>
      That made me think that what if russian has roots to those ancient
      languages of the past, and it doesn't mean aothers don't. And I
      know we all do, we relate them one way or another, and what if
      it's so fit we can write russian in it and read it rather easily
      because the things there sound like ours? What if egyptian
      hieroglyphs could be read in oter cultures by their scolars who
      could read it in their own language? I can test it right here,
      let's find how blue is in egyptian, and if it's near s, it is
      interesting.<br>
      <br>
      http://hieroglyphs.net doesn't know neither blue nor green, but it
      knows man, it's s, and it doesn't help.<br>
      and for whatever reason in reads king not how it's written,
      because it's literally satan:<br>

      while I was trying to find what I believe to be a berry, I found a
      weird sign I saw somewhere else:<br>
      𓊖 looks like one of phaestos disk's so whether the forger took
      this peculiar sign from egyptian, or that disk is authentic script
      not far from egyptian (then we have to compare these two, even
      though I posted someone showing how phaestos disk is a fraud, but
      I didn't read into that myself, so I can keep my intellectual
      freedom on this subject)<br>

      <br>
      once again about tolkien:<br>
      He's littered the pool of linguistic information with his invented
      writing systems.<br>
      The only writing system he took without much change (but to which
      he only made several weird additions) was nordic runes Nazi
      Germany was researching the most. And of course those runes were
      used by the bad guys (I'm speaking of Uruk Runes. Cyrth was much
      more different than the anglo saxon runes, and I don't know if
      calling some nation dwarves is actually flattering)<br>
      But when some Norwegian journalist noticed that, Tolkien cared
      enough to try to refute it with his response about him not having
      a slightest intention to have such parallels in mind, that he's
      apolitical and blablabla, that he's very offended by that
      interpretation of his work (as if it was much more than mere
      propaganda)<br>
      &gt; In the Foreword to the revised edition of The Lord of the
      Rings, Tolkien cautioned strongly against viewing it as an
      allegory, saying that he disliked allegory himself. Furthermore,
      according to his own claims, Tolkien denounced Hitler, Nazi
      beliefs, "race-doctrine" and apartheid and praised the Jews,
      calling them a "gifted people".<br>
      <br>
      Jews are gifted people alright, but even not speaking of the
      nature of that gift, that guy licks their asses for politically
      correct reasons, and he is successful, so maybe someone will learn
      from his example. But as for that work it would be a false note, I
      sympathize them and I dare I say it, fear them, even that, but
      that's another reason for me to be brave and honest, also because
      as Camus righteously said, nothing is more despicable than respect
      based on fear.<br>
      And though I lack that very portion of respect, I still offer some
      ambiadvantageous solutions, because it's the most rational thing
      to do in this situation. Hate the sin, not the sinner, remember?<br>
      People have little to no responsibility for whether genome they
      were born with or the culture they were plunged into. But both
      factors can be improved by genetic therapies and friendly
      counteractions.<br>
      Do you call such rants friendly? Yes, I do, honesty is friendly.
      Just as banters, they help us all evolve. Even when it hurts, its'
      medicinal, really.<br>
      <font color="#ffffff" size="-1"><br>
        Only now have I realized why does this work sound antisemitic
        (4снад screenshot was only natural) and that's the notion that
        semitic linguistic, the very centre of it, rots. Even though I <br>
        show that every other branch is not much better (I don't, I'm an
        antisemite, because many jews will not like that. Then let's not
        notice it. keep it in mind, but at least hide it from a plain
        sight, they will survive, help them) and I was brainwashed by
        some jew saying "antisemite as every great russian writer"
        Zionists support antisemitism. And they're white.
        overcompensate.<br>

      Back to that J is L hermesy, <br>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBjOs-egFMs"><font
          color="#000000">Here</font></a> a drunk mason claims that
      jewish god is Lucifer, and where I took I sent this response:<br>
      <blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3263153">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        Sombody didn't make his homework properly and got it all wrong.<br>
        Jesus and Lucifer is probably the same figure.<br>
        The jewish god though is the satan (as Book of Revelation
        righteously repeats at least twice)<br>
        In early christianity (aka gnosticism) Jesus was allegorically
        reprsented as a snake. And there are some ancient images, on
        coins for example with snake on a cross.<br>
        Masonry seems to be some gnostic school of whatever, though I'm
        not sure we really need this mumbo-jumbo for anything else other
        than to comprehend the rationale of those top-rank religious
        pricks. They'd rather have you not knowing the difference
        between good and evil, for being ignorant you would obey much
        easier and with less of uncomfortable quesions. <br>
        Also many satanists borrowed the Lucifer's image from his
        enemies, who are the Devils themselves (Mary'ed people, if I
        understand it right that Devil is suffixed form of Deva and Evil
        is of Eve, but of course it all seems pretty relativistic today,
        even though women and evil are on the same side in Tai Chi, but
        probably because when we're in love our hormones drive us dement
        (which could be a suffixed form of demon: mad is beshen in
        russian, bes is a demon) but that hormone disbalance's our
        problem, gals shouldn't be held responsible, that would be some
        catholic-tier satanism, and it makes the world uglier: a good
        excuse for ugly muslims who hate beauty, because Lucifer is told
        to be the prettiest of all the angels and the most beloved of
        that heavenly king who is a satan in palms of whom this world is
        until Esus comes back for good, but that reference make it all
        even more complicated, some ancient cults with their savage
        barbarian traditions, we should't be reconstructing those stages
        of our society, maybe only to look at it and laugh, because by
        laugh we get rid of the past)<br>
        Also both Jesus and Lucifer bear the title of Moring Star (the
        very last plot-twist of the new testament) and so on.</blockquote>

            seth, who was not only satan but also the third son of some
            biblical figure, so the trick of this rite is that we should
            realy take it easy because we're not capable of

      <font color="#999999">Informational singularity is probably here,
        according to how fast information travels. It was just yesterday
        when I found that I probably turned a good guy named
        proteineinsaider insane with my spheric capsule thing. Or maybe
        he just looks this way, because his poor drawing skills and with
        his being a lady maybe, otherwise why'd he use so much pink.
        That would explain it a lot. I also foud some AnyaLove000001 who
        is whether that proteineinsaider or a huge fan of his (her first
        posting is years after it appeared at 2ch, but it literally uses
        tag моё for something very similar to what (s)he posted at 2ch
        and later she uses proteineinsaider's work with title of С
        просторов интернета на тему вечной автономной капсулы, as if she
        knew about it because somebody in the comments told her about
        it, but I suppose it's for conspiracy (для конспирации, a
        disguise) but why I mention it here is that I should be careful
        with all this information, because it can lead people further
        out of balance. I wish that lady well. And I will probably
        contact her to use her in our documentary (a friend from tv is
        making a film with me and some other weird guys, and I openly
        highjack his project into a direction he will also like) so that
        lady who tells that Jesus is Lucifer published it probably a
        year ago (according to the comments) and she could also be
        influenced by me, so at this point I should be careful with
        references, not to bring some circular references. Either way,
        references never proved anything, no matter how important they
        become in contemporary academia (which is still a bunch of
        faggots, pun intended)</font><br>

      : seconds in and I've already realized that those skulls could be
      representing female figures (it became more obvious when I
      explored that rostral opening) and this hypothesis can be
      confirmed if some terracotta used to complete the sculpture, or
      refuted if such artifacts are never found. A decade ago I noticed
      that some terracotta crucifices look pretty much like bovine
      skulls and now this. <br>

      Russian band Нуки can be transliterated as Noockie, if we want to
      make a magic four-letter name (кино, cure, abba) into
      seven-lettern name (madonna, michael jackson)<br>
      but it shows how it's similar to russians, which is rooskie in
      russian (c is always read as in cinema in russian, like s) rookie
      is новичок, новобранец, рекрут, n instead of r makes it
      new-russians, as if n is another r, Н another R, h ~ R, п looks
      exactly like n in cursive, п is p in lating, p is r in russian. We
      are noockie, but it looks like носки (socks) and many russian
      surnameds end на sky.<br>
      And ruckie is probably <br>

      как может N быть Т это понятно, обе язычны, но как мог П оказаться

      see how many cases of lingual and labial having met!<br>
      also m is both M &amp; T, n is both N &amp; P (looks like since N
      and M are invariants, and one is lingual, the other is labial, all
      the letters after them are their whispering invariants: but why
      not T to M &amp; not P to N, but in reverse? if M and N are
      ivariants, then so is T &amp; П, 3 &amp; 2, both are пара, so what

      and initially it was not 6 digits per die, but only 4 (ctrlF vol.1

      <br>
      and because there were only 3 vowels... or could there be 4 vowels
      already when that divination appeared? then... one bone is left,
      the other right and... which is vowel which is consonant? or is it
      labial and lingual and vowels don't play here, they are for

      Ruck is чернь (rookie is probably related, as fookie would be

      I missed MSPaint so I found KolourPaint, it works well, like that
      one, maybe even better, but text cannot be copy-pasted when you
      still type it there. And now I cannot exit it directly, let's keep
      this drafty leaf there, for those who doesn't see it, it tells
      that glagolitic vowels are double forms of european, so he who
      invented it probably did it on purpose so someone who knows
      european and knows the keys can read it (thus it could be invented
      if not by kirl, by some other nationalist, I should be not biased,
      but based) I missed E: in glagolica it has not three strokes, but
      four (or not 1 but 2 depending on how you look at that)<br>
      and their ω looks like double ω.<br>
      <br>
      And I don't know why that pdf cuts the M's balls, but in this form
      M also looks like double M, two inverted M's, doubleW:<br>
      <img src="V_files/glagolythic-edit2.png" alt="" width="362"
        height="388"><br>
      And L looks like double lamed, so now I wouldn't be surprised if
      that was some later form of alphabet, fabricated by doubling the
      wide-known european ones, But what if other european alphabets
      just simplified this form? But where are archeologic evidence of
      the spread of glagolitic writing? In greek cursive δ looks like Ⰴ
      as it's written on the table below: <font color="#cccccc">(and in
        that first one with text on it)</font><br>

            safely without being cooked, probably that's why in russian
            cheese is сыр, which could be short form of сырой (raw) and
            that could also explain why cheese with mold can be consumed

              for driving evil spirits away, the pipe of peace was
              probably using something way more shamanic, and always
              well, nobody should have died of such pipe, otherwise it
              could be the only peace they'd get. Cannabis seem to be

        color="#cccccc"> (fade)</font> the variants into white, for your
      pleasure. my honour.<br>
      <br>
      honor is гонор in russian and it's temper, not hoor. <br>
      but temper is next to honor, thus that typo above is of no value:
      whores are the opposite of гонор, мэйби онли ту зэя хасбандс, but
      actually whore is no honour,&nbsp; honor ~is~ not a whore, bitch
      has some honour, but I don't like bitches, but I do not like whore
      either, in every woman I find some flaw not to be disturbed from
      my magical science oh magnificient science, looks what I'm doing,
      probably wouldn't be able to do if my cock was sucked. But I never
      really tried fat women, oh they're so easy to dismiss, fat looked
      ugly to me as to many other guys, only recently have I began
      looking at their plump cunts as when they're in clothes, I only
      avert when I imagine their bellies bigger than their tits, it's as
      if I fuck some fat dude, I don't mind titless gals really, even
      though pedoa is taboo to me, but if they're slim I watched a lot
      of fashion magazines to find bonies attractive af. Should I design
      clothes for fatsos to fuck? Should I pretend to be gay not to
      sleep with my models or should I claim my asexuality and then
      should I demand my A in their lgbt quiz or should I sustain from
      their озабоченного community?<br>
      I guess it will be a bridge for h to join their party, and what
      other reasons for heroin addicts to join gay community if not to
      sell drugs? to make monety (what a magnificient typo for mone!@Y)
      монетой,? из ит уот зыс нью тайпо теллс? I was talking of
      heterosexuals, but if gay is g, straight is S, and that is gay af.

      <br>
      Back to that IFBW (and that the name for one of my bands, because
      they all may differ) and it a little surprises me that it's as if
      I tried to say I'm, but mentioned all the other labials instead
      (is V ~ N ~ M?)<br>
      And I was also surprised to notice, that Feed and Fuck are
      somewhat similar; Both is similar to Black, because if I fuck the
      blacks, I do fuck the whites, whites are more valuable where I
      live; (I read that ; was used to be a ?, but here it's a form of
      ,) Women and Wolves, or Wolverines (are those two species
      misinterpreted as ВорОны (Crows) and ВОроны (Ravens) in russian?)
      <br>
      And I tried to decipher some wide-known abbreviatours with that
      formula, and the first I found was FBI, which I immediately
      translated as Fuck Bad Individuals (actually the first guess was
      Fuck Black Individuals, but I thought that it's a racist
      misconception to call them blacks, because they're actually
      different shades of brown, but brown also begins with B, so that
      could be where I hit the core of that: B is yin, T(D) is yang,
      both black and bad are yin features, afaik) far isn't fuck or
      feed.. We'll wait for other hypothetic bandnames to find other
      basal meanings of cool official abbreviatures)<br>
      <br>
      That IFBW thing appeared <font color="#cccccc">(in this terms,
        the concept is at least a couple of years old, and the concept
        of which it's a part of is much more ancient decision to keep
        neutrality in the battle between angels and demons, trying to
        negotiate peace between the parties for mutual benefits) </font>after





















      I met Nuki, and realized that they're pretty jewish, and АХС are
      the opposite (even though some people say Hitler was a jew) and
      good thing is I realized they don't need money (the jews have all
      the money in the world) so I will keep on donating to AXC only, to
      avoid being a glore.. I mean, glory-hunter, and here it seems how
      the words appear: a bro is a huge football fan, and he went to
      some game in London, where he found the term глоры, as if he was
      told "those are glores we don't like them" probably he was told
      "those are glory hunters", but he considered hunters be some sort
      of bastards, as if glory is the term per so, because -y is how you
      make plural in russian. (somehow some time ago I found the term
      glors or glores, as if it was shortened for glory-hunters, so I
      searched for glory-hunters and found many times urbandictionary
      saying it's those fans who always support the winning team, and
      only some gothic whores (goth-loli-whores?) for glores (non for
      glors)<br>
      Or I found it because глоры is a term in russian football fans
      terminology: has brother found it there? or have he sew it there?
      nah, 592 million cases of глор in google. Or is it a common
      mistake of the foreigners? probably so, or urbandictionary doesn't
      register brittish slang (I tried a few brit.slang.terms I know and
      it seems it knows) <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      that academia.edu thing, I like them: they just recommended me to
      read The White Godd<a

      I wanted to do for such a long time, and now I see it has
      references to King Jesus I probably stumbled upon trying to read
      it the last time. Now I ctrlFed it for alphabet, and try it out by
      yourself, I haven't read the b<a

      they weigh the same!) <br>
      <br>
      And here I understand another reason for my work unfit for the
      other academia: it discovers that information from somebody they
      disregarded happened to be the authentic and more accurate then
      the record they preserved (or have they left it out to disturb
      those fields and thus they preserved some doors we can now travel

      recommendd me I think of jews who probably produce all that good

      because they contain enourmous ammount of knowledge and culture:
      in russia they probably killed most of intelligent people, but
      they probably kept few good ones to teach their children, so their
      children would be the only cultured ones (and some goy-dogs can
      eat whatever falls from their masters' tables) I'm so mean at the
      way I deliver this stuff, but I dare to say it because... ah, I
      would dare anyway, but I make it so boldly because this good je<a

      another reason holocoast must be prevented, some jews are great,
      as any other population has its percentage of brighties, it's only
      the most of overexposed jews that annoy us, but no need to throw
      the babies with the water, god knows we're all shit, different
      proportions of shit in each of us, but probably noone has that
      proportion at zero) That thought began few hours before that when
      I thought of musical education mostly jews was welcome into, so it

      Begotten and Cryptorchid, but stole it from the artsy cinema he
      liked to get into as a kid (just compare those two and the birds
      to to his other crap and how he struggled to imitate that style in
      Antichrist Superstar, but it don't belong here, I analyzed it well
      elsewhere, and here I said enough for anyone to line the dots) and
      also found that Pizza Face (one of the first videos with Flea,
      which let me into RHCP rabbit hole with Irons and his role in

      Funny that it also goes vowel-labial-linguals, if we look by
      pronounciation of the actual words.<br>
      Funny, that the final letter of the first line is to (十) in 十日
      [とおか] but in all other cases it's じゅう so I'm not sure if this
      similarity I found in a dictionary is reliable. <br>
      Funny, that that form of to in first line is read as do, as D in
      the first line of the alphabet.<br>
      Funny, that it's I, that is read as 1 sometimes, and 一 is read as
      い [i] <br>
      Funny, that ro can be a later grammatic suffix or vowel added in
      sanskrit.<br>
      Funny, that only one syllable in the labial word<br>
      Funny, that third word is all lingual syllables.<br>
      Funny, that there're 7 signs in the first line, just as if 7
      musical notes, for which those 7 syllables are used, and 8th most
      probably isn't (jisho.org translates only those 7 as musical
      notes)<br>
      <br>
      Let's rewrite the first line, this time in text:<br>
      いろはにほへと &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iro ha nihoheto &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      色は匂えど &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iro wa nioedo &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      So I guess that the first form of this line could have been in
      this form: いはと (i wa do) <br>
      And in this I cross out linguists reconstruction of ancient form
      of は as of ha (because hu is fu, and there was something else I
      don't remember at the moment)<br>
      いはと<br>
      Funny, that cursive א is very similar to い (the same strokes only
      in different order, and japanese is written in the different
      direction)<br>
      Funny, that は graphically reminds B, or even more so Б<br>
      Funny, that と reminds both c &amp; d (and thus stands for both,
      see ᚦ)<br>

      what if into is i-not as بلى (bala) is yes in arabic (bu is no in

      confirmation of "not no"?<br>

      and I was given a perfect answer: &gt;where the left-hand side has
      to be interpreted as being the value obtained by using one of the
      aforementioned summation methods and not as the sum of an infinite
      series in its usual meaning.<br>
      But it the semi-trolling mode I didn't even notice it, trying to
      turn it all into a joke. I didn't even notice, here is how we can
      learn, returning to the words we said which text form allows.
      forms allow. that s..<br>
      form allows many allow, it just does. allowed is probably once, ed

      and that perfect answer still didn't answer why did they use name
      and notation of something else. Is it because in India notation
      was different and they unified those systems in such a weird way,

      It is here because I already spoke about false or overobscured
      concepts in other fields of science, now it is time for math.<br>
      I am very suspicious about imaginary numbers, and will make
      another attempt to see them as functions of x &amp; y, <font

      for they use axes for working with those numbers, it's as if
      normal numbers are linear and complex numbers are planar. But I'm
      really ready to find this field to be balloney of bologna of
      humanitarian fields on the top of the foney of the<font

      phonology and so on into physiology and physics, the real sciences
      (not imaginary) on the authority of which balony of baloney is the
      word. I wonder what the real etymology of Phoney Baloney is.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">And I've shown that baloney also corrupted
        phoney or was it always this weird. Why am I so weird? Am I

        That rant about Bologne where I never was was caused by
        something I heard, and though I realize it's completely not sane
        to be tHAT politically incorrect, I must also set an example of
        not being affraid of anything, so I proceded to read some about
        Bologne University and in russian wiki (in 02 2020) it's said
        that the university appeared as a law school to compete the one
        in Ravenna (in english wiki I don't see that) and that Ravenna
        was in opposition to Rome and Bologne was in good conditions
        with Rome (which already controlled another university, in
        Paris, because that one was theologic, and at first Bologne was
        independent university, but eventually Rome got their levers in
        it too, when they demanded a theology department after fine arts
        began teaching medicine too, as far as I got it, could be wrong
        on the bla bal asusal<br>
        So here I've shown that catholic church did establish university
        system, they never really was in opposition, lead what you
        cannot stop, hold your enemies closer than your friends. wise
        politics keeps this obviously fraudulent structure of the church
        in favor of jurisprudence, because those jus juris are in the
        centre of the structure of our society, the true spiders, and I
        dare to fly out of their network, rude.<br>
        <br>
        And I was looking for what ancient university has name similar
        to Phones, and I only see Sorbonne. Is F сорное B?<br>
        phoney and phony two similar words. </font><br>

      <font color="#999999">THa</font><font color="#999999">ᛏ part is
        rather raw or otherwise outrageous, so I left it here for later</font><br>
      <br>
      I'm not even sure that math part should really be here, but as I
      said, being in the very beginning of the ponderpath is not a
      reason enough to exclude this outta here, this book probably saw
      worse.<br>

      If not that ramanujan summations, that <font size="+1">A
        "theorem" of Jan-Erik Roos in 1961 stated that in an [AB4*]
        abelian category, lim1 vanishes on Mittag-Leffler sequences.
        This "theorem" was used by many people since then, but it was
        disproved by counterexample in 2002 by Amnon Neeman.</font>
      episode can reveal where the fabric of the math itself tears out
      of the grasp os some spider net of overcomplications and I wonder
      how far can it tear. if x^0 being 1 is amon those false concepts
      referring to one another, I won't be surprised, but of course this
      course could be a manifestation of some grandeur delusion on my
      side, even though psychology is not a true science just as its
      marriage to pharmacology also isn't. some Dunning–Kruger effect it
      can be. or the opposite.<br>
      But at least then you'll probably see my comprehension of those
      weird fields of math you all probably would also like to
      understand. Zeta function, I am coming after you!<br>
      <br>
      One good think I can say about Bologne U: is that there students
      were the boss.A good example and a perfect standart for any other
      uni of the kind. Also those universities, no matter how flawed,
      probably were a grasp of fresh air in the comparison to the darker
      ages before that.<br>
      And though the scent appearing there from the very beginning is
      the root of the poor state science and education are in today, I
      probably should show some respect to those legacies? Or maybe I
      shouldn't.<br>
      It's none of my business bashing the collapsing colossus, <font
        color="#cccccc">ages path </font>ages pass one another, new
      forms of what those institutions delivered are coming to change
      the predecessors, with decency and respect, please. (as somebody

      I found my self among math, thinking of what 1-1+1-1+1-1 row is
      and what 1/2 is to it. It is some "constant" (as ramanujan called
      it, not sum) around which the row jumps back and forth, as if at
      that point the sp<font color="#cccccc">r</font>ing is fixed.<br>
      pr is just a form of whriting that sound, which could be
      transliterated as both p &amp; r (p is r in russian. pussian,

      It's where it makes sense to them, as if it's some modified
      definition of zero, as if where two theories fluctuate around the
      truth. Can we find truth my summation of all possible theories?<br>
      And that fluctuation happens somewhere on the other end of the
      string we were supposed to find by the summation. Why would we
      look at the other end? Is it because that's where 1-1+1-1.. equals
      1/2? at the base of it? where the function was written down by the
      initial number in the substantial part and the rest of he function
      in so called imaginary part - look at how he who invented complex
      numbers called it, it could be the same nomenclature renaming
      things to obscure them or simply out of ignorance of theirs.<br>

      Then it correlates the figure of the sieger to nazi swastika, but
      it dissonates that concept of lucky-unlucky. Could nazi swastika

      no. <br>
      So &amp; no are the opposites. So = yeS. No is "clockwise",

      like inversed f (as g (𐤂) is inversed Г, 𐤄 is inversed E, and
      they are inversed because they wrote right to left and greeks went
      left to right) if my comparisons don't look like relating to
      either of these representations of phoenician (the one above and
      one below) compare them between themselves and see that there are
      several forms like A &amp; a.<br>

      text form: 𐤊<br>
      ᚴ makes k inversed h? but k in h form is also seen. <br>
      also 𐤅, which stands where F is, looks just like Y (especially in
      the image) which combines Y &amp; F even stronger than 𐤉 standing
      for i, or they even transliterate as Y in that image, looking just
      like inverted F.<br>
      And if we recognize Ḥ as fowel (vowel) - just as H is E, and EWZ
      is a linge alright - then ḤṬY (𐤇 𐤈 𐤉) could be another line,
      which places L into vowel position and LMN becomes a valid line.
      word line can be that very lmn structure, if m does relate to y
      (which it does over v &amp; n, but that's still not convincing
      enough)<br>

      Socrates taught both monotheism and pederasty, and it could be not
      a coincidence: before monotheism at least duality was present,
      after that some hermaphrodite appeared instead of Hermes and
      Aphrodite.<br>
      <br>
      There also was a more explicit form of обожение in polytheism,
      monotheism stopped that, but only until baby Jesus came, but not
      for long, the antichrist of Saul tuned it all back but forcing his
      way claiming that J was that very monotheistic g.o.d. himselſ.
      Even though J himself taught that he is OUR celestial father, and
      that he baby j is no different in that we all can do what he did.<br>

      B is buki in russian, and now I wonder if that letter represents a
      couple of books? Like old and new testament maybe, or since the
      form appeared before Christ, could this meme of two testaments be
      older than that? Like old and new eddas or something.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Waves of information brought me something relating to what this
      work begins with and it also mentions some other ogham. I will ask
      the author what it all means after I read this chapter myself:<br>
      <br>
      <a
href="https://www.academia.edu/41982447/The_Seven_Seers_of_the_Northern_World"><img

          alt="" border="0" width="620" height="3168"></a><br>
      <br>
      So I asked:<br>
      <span class="js-non-expanded-comment">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        <span class="js-non-expanded-comment">The word ogham used in
          page 14 - how does that term relates to the ogham the writing
          system and where is the best to read about it was my question,
          before I found <a
            href="https://www.kenttreeogham.co.uk/ogham/"
            title="https://www.kenttreeogham.co.uk/ogham/"
            target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.kenttreeogham.co.uk/ogham/</a>
          where it also tells "Like alpha-beta, the ogham is sometimes
          called by its first letters, beth luis fearn or beith luis
          nin." Which is the question of when did Beth-luis-nun become
          beth-luis-fearn, and doesnt beth-luis-nuin term tell that
          earlier form of ogham was not quinary but ternary?</span></span><br>

      <br>
      I also wanted to ask him<br>
      &gt; seven Maines and seven Manus of the Irish Texts and of the
      Indian Puranic myths... sons of Medb and Mādhavi <br>
      <br>
      Letter M has some special position in the alphabet. I also read
      somewhere that every letter stands for some deity. Could you
      please look if you can tell which religious tradition fits the
      alphabetic structure the most?<br>
      <br>
      but I decided not to. at least for now.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      but instead I contacted another big man, with this letter the
      poetic end of which I will use for my further research: <br>

      <br>
      &gt; Луна соответствует чакре сердца, а лунные узлы Раху и Кету<br>
      Раха и Кет - нзвание этих дополнительных чакр? <br>
      Эти три чакры - три фазы Луны? (триединое божество в
      дохристианской традиции было женского пола (тридеви хронологически
      раньше тримурти) и общеиндоевропейским:
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moirai (три женщины, молодая,
      взрослая, старая как фазы луны растущая, полная, стареющая)<br>
      Фазы луны намекают на четвёртую ноту (мёртвую?) сокрытую
      (захороненую?) и в алфавите (который по легенде был этим же
      триединым божеством создан (aeiou.ru) uvw имеют четвёртую сестру:
      y (а ъыь имеют то ли б то ли ѣ, но б-ѣ имя табуированное, но и не
      факт что это связано, потому что иначе это и есть dieu bla,
      Deva'l, Eve'l, ибо в тай-чи солнцу противопоставлена луна, но lune
      = moon, maður = man говорит о том что это слово матриархальной
      культуры? Тогда как S-n это и Son, и Sun, и Satan, божество
      которому плевать на наши молитвы? тогда как луна непосредственно
      связана с жидкостями на нашей планеты, что объясняет
      противопоставление воды и огня, но луна ассоциировалась с
      зеркалом, в которое лишь смотрится земля? потому что материнский
      культ связан с землёй, змеёй? god ~ гад? это какое-то гадание,
      извините за сырую информацию, но я не ожидал что гадание так
      похоже на гад, это камлание? нет, это что-то другое скорее всего,
      но земля как раз жертвы (удобрения) принимает, может индусы потому
      и уважают матушек коров, <br>
      http://www.symbolarium.ru/index.php/Корова - Основные значения:
      Великая Мать, богини Луны;<br>
      я видел конечно корову с луной (ниже пишут, что с солнцем) меж
      рогов, и что рога в форме месяца, серпа? mes меч в монгольском
      вроде и нож в нидерландском, месник и мясо могут тоже быть от
      этого месяца<br>
      https://www.newacropol.ru/Alexandria/symbols/cow/ - Она также
      представляла луну и небо; ее рога напоминали полумесяц, а молоко
      ассоциировалось с Млечным Путем. Встречающиеся изображения коровы
      с диском Солнца между рогами являются отражением идеи о небесной
      корове-матери, которая заботится о Солнце в течение ночи. Великая
      Мать и лунные богини зачастую изображались с коровьими рогами.<br>
      https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Хатхор - В древнейший период Хатхор
      почиталась как небесная корова, родившая солнце<br>
      &gt;&nbsp; Даже если заблокирована какая-то чакра на спинном
      мозгу, необходимо поработать руками.<br>
      эти две дополнительные чакры отвечают за руки? (ссылка на

        different fields (orthography &amp; phonetics) <br>
        and phonetics being so abundant in its symbolics still places
        same signs in different cells, which tells it's all not certain
        (and different people pronounce the same sounds differently) and
        unnecessary when audio-recordings is widely available (but not
        in books made out of trees)<br>
        and I still didn't find the one I needed: Åå so it was too much
        of an honour indeed, or am I just grumpy?<br>
