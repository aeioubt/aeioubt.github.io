      It is volume V of one weird book: <a href="http://aeiou.ru/">0</a>

      <font color="#cccccc">it is all not always anything more than a
        draft, read at your own risk. </font><br>
      That fourth volume ends as if would end if I died in the end, one
      thought in front of the other. <br>
      I was going to speak of Λ as ^<br>
      check this out:<br>

          ball group" was to be here, or how does it relate to kesler? I
          cannot understand this part myself, and I'm shocked by that a
          little) </font>so dare I say could kesler<a
          href="https://vk.com/doc17768761_42678478">'</a>s assumption
        of letters having one(?) to five(?) semantic meanings it can
        take in different words, dare I say, correct? That was a good
        classification of language by semantics, it was an awesome work
        I read in the 90s I think, though I put it away when he began
        building his lexics, because I wanted to make it myself,
        independently, so I could compare my findings to his dictionary.
        And now it seems I can do it:</font><br>

      With these two raw aſf but neverthe less dictionaries to what
      kessler theorized and thus to Kessler<a
        href="mirrors/Ya_A_Kesler_Azbuka_i_russko-evropeyskiy_slovar.pdf"><font
          color="#000000">'</font></a>s:.<br>
      but no, let some ai (artificial or augmented intelligence) does it
      afterwards, because I tried to find алый in his Ъ groups, and I
      couldn't find it. I would place it whether in Ъ6 next to fire
      (look at the very end of the book to see his rationalization of
      fire being with Я) or to Ъ18 next to ярый (яркий, эти группы
      связаны и не понятно умышленно или случайно, и не известно что
      страшней, ууууу)<br>
      <br>
      so I put a mirror to his book at that previous ' in case the link
      in the one before it dies, <br>
      <br>
      even though he's considered to be a freak. I think he't the best
      of all freaks, and now it's time to collect them all in one place,
      so both me and we can learn from their flaws so my work is more
      likely to be accepted if I avoid all their flaws I will make my
      best to notice:<br>

      See how halaḥam follow the tradition I've seen first in Arabic
      vowel diacritics:<br>
      unlike philippines writing system make it, here u gets a high
      mark, and i gets a low mark, which would be more natural for me as
      a child (elephant is high, so why his sound is low? and mouse is
      visa versa)<br>

      <img src="img/141.png" alt="" width="378" height="404"><br>
      But here we see why it could be: in philippines the order is AIU,
      and this one is the other order, and it makes these writing
      systems related to ogham of all things, which could be related to
      some berber ancients. The following research is needed, and it's
      time to add english version of colored ge'ez to vol.1.<br>
      <br>
      But I only added the text version, maybe some day will remake it

      This time I also noticed what I misse the first time (other than
      хы хо во in ge'ez part) the other b-line, in the final row of ኀ:
      not only ጰ, but also some ፐ which is out of the structure, and yet
      to be archeologized in the archives of ethiopean philology.<br>
      <br>
      (that piece I copy-pasted from vol.1 where I just put it. well, at
      least for those who missed this edition, because he reads vol.2 or
      3 when I update vol.1<br>
      And more than that to speak more about it not overcomplicating
      vol.1 with this autism:<br>
      <br>
      ሀ and በ oppose each other as a opposes б if you can see it. and we
      were talking of b reflecting d this way, but a &amp; d are
      probably historically the same letter, then e is c, o is ?, u is
      v=в=b, and we return to A reflecting V which is D reflecting B, I
      hope you follow this.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc"><br>
        And suddenly.. halaḥam, ogham (both has u's before i's)<br>
        ham is a rude person in russian (хам) <br>
        so does it make cultures that let i's (thin people, ladies(?))
        front more civilized? than those where big ones go first because
        it's better not to stand on their way: if they fall on you it
        may be a naughty knock-out. only guessing, hardly scientific is
        this guess, but hypotheses do belong scientific literature, I
        already said why, they can be proven or disproven by the reader.
        They also remind the reader, that some scientific information is
        not valid, even when it is displayed arrogantly certainly it can
        be false or wrong.</font><br>
      <br>
      I speak of someting important and on the same breath I speak of
      something hardly right or important, at least I can put it into
      grey. <font color="#cccccc">and it was here before I copypasted
        that vol.1 thing + its autism, so it's not on the same breath</font><br>
      <br>
      ሀ (a) turning into ሁ (u) in its diacritic form could be an attempt
      to notify u when it comes out of a and into u as it is bሀs, but
      abሁse. or it could be some other story, but actually I came here
      to say that in this ሀ both a &amp; u meet, it could be from those
      time when A &amp; U wasn't separated, but that sets an important
      question of how would people distinguish speech if so many now
      different things were the same.<br>

      The beginning of this volume will always want me to do something
      else, so embarrasing it is.<br>
      But I keep on digging, because sometimes some treasures appear.<br>
      <br>
      I also write in my notebooks (another portion of scans is coming
      in several months only, when the summer comes, I don't want to go

      <br>
      <br>
      Russian orthography is made up by the germans (and etymology too)
      yet<br>
      if we write russian word for blue not the way they tell us, but
      the way we speak it, it's синии, сини is also that word (a short
      form of it) thus that reminds very much egyptian 𓏭 and 𓏼
      standing in egyptian grammar for a suffix of plural form.<br>
      <br>
      That made me think that what if russian has roots to those ancient
      languages of the past, and it doesn't mean aothers don't. And I
      know we all do, we relate them one way or another, and what if
      it's so fit we can write russian in it and read it rather easily
      because the things there sound like ours? What if egyptian
      hieroglyphs could be read in oter cultures by their scolars who
      could read it in their own language? I can test it right here,
      let's find how blue is in egyptian, and if it's near s, it is
      interesting.<br>
      <br>
      http://hieroglyphs.net doesn't know neither blue nor green, but it
      knows man, it's s, and it doesn't help.<br>
      and for whatever reason in reads king not how it's written,
      because it's literally satan:<br>

      while I was trying to find what I believe to be a berry, I found a
      weird sign I saw somewhere else:<br>
      𓊖 looks like one of phaestos disk's so whether the forger took
      this peculiar sign from egyptian, or that disk is authentic script
      not far from egyptian (then we have to compare these two, even
      though I posted someone showing how phaestos disk is a fraud, but
      I didn't read into that myself, so I can keep my intellectual
      freedom on this subject)<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      once again about tolkien:<br>
      He's littered the pool of linguistic information with his invented
      writing systems.<br>
      The only writing system he took without much change (but to which
      he only made several weird additions) was nordic runes Nazi
      Germany was researching the most. And of course those runes were
      used by the bad guys (I'm speaking of Uruk Runes. Cyrth was much
      more different than the anglo saxon runes, and I don't know if
      calling some nation dwarves is actually flattering)<br>
      But when some Norwegian journalist noticed that, Tolkien cared
      enough to try to refute it with his response about him not having
      a slightest intention to have such parallels in mind, that he's
      apolitical and blablabla, that he's very offended by that
      interpretation of his work (as if it was much more than mere
      propaganda)<br>
      &gt; In the Foreword to the revised edition of The Lord of the
      Rings, Tolkien cautioned strongly against viewing it as an
      allegory, saying that he disliked allegory himself. Furthermore,
      according to his own claims, Tolkien denounced Hitler, Nazi
      beliefs, "race-doctrine" and apartheid and praised the Jews,
      calling them a "gifted people".<br>
      <br>
      Jews are gifted people alright, but even not speaking of the
      nature of that gift, that guy licks their asses for politically
      correct reasons, and he is successful, so maybe someone will learn
      from his example. But as for that work it would be a false note, I
      sympathize them and I dare I say it, fear them, even that, but
      that's another reason for me to be brave and honest, also because
      as Camus righteously said, nothing is more despicable than respect
      based on fear.<br>
      And though I lack that very portion of respect, I still offer some
      ambiadvantageous solutions, because it's the most rational thing
      to do in this situation. Hate the sin, not the sinner, remember?<br>
      People have little to no responsibility for whether genome they
      were born with or the culture they were plunged into. But both
      factors can be improved by genetic therapies and friendly
      counteractions.<br>
      Do you call such rants friendly? Yes, I do, honesty is friendly.
      Just as banters, they help us all evolve. Even when it hurts, its'
      medicinal, really.<br>
      <font color="#ffffff" size="-1"><br>
        Only now have I realized why does this work sound antisemitic
        (4снад screenshot was only natural) and that's the notion that
        semitic linguistic, the very centre of it, rots. Even though I <br>
        show that every other branch is not much better (I don't, I'm an
        antisemite, because many jews will not like that. Then let's not
        notice it. keep it in mind, but at least hide it from a plain
        sight, they will survive, help them) and I was brainwashed by
        some jew saying "antisemite as every great russian writer"
        Zionists support antisemitism. And they're white.
        overcompensate.<br>

      Back to that J is L hermesy, <br>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBjOs-egFMs"><font
          color="#000000">Here</font></a> a drunk mason claims that
      jewish god is Lucifer, and where I took I sent this response:<br>
      <blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3263153">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        Sombody didn't make his homework properly and got it all wrong.<br>
        Jesus and Lucifer is probably the same figure.<br>
        The jewish god though is the satan (as Book of Revelation
        righteously repeats at least twice)<br>
        In early christianity (aka gnosticism) Jesus was allegorically
        reprsented as a snake. And there are some ancient images, on
        coins for example with snake on a cross.<br>
        Masonry seems to be some gnostic school of whatever, though I'm
        not sure we really need this mumbo-jumbo for anything else other
        than to comprehend the rationale of those top-rank religious
        pricks. They'd rather have you not knowing the difference
        between good and evil, for being ignorant you would obey much
        easier and with less of uncomfortable quesions. <br>
        Also many satanists borrowed the Lucifer's image from his
        enemies, who are the Devils themselves (Mary'ed people, if I
        understand it right that Devil is suffixed form of Deva and Evil
        is of Eve, but of course it all seems pretty relativistic today,
        even though women and evil are on the same side in Tai Chi, but
        probably because when we're in love our hormones drive us dement
        (which could be a suffixed form of demon: mad is beshen in
        russian, bes is a demon) but that hormone disbalance's our
        problem, gals shouldn't be held responsible, that would be some
        catholic-tier satanism, and it makes the world uglier: a good
        excuse for ugly muslims who hate beauty, because Lucifer is told
        to be the prettiest of all the angels and the most beloved of
        that heavenly king who is a satan in palms of whom this world is
        until Esus comes back for good, but that reference make it all
        even more complicated, some ancient cults with their savage
        barbarian traditions, we should't be reconstructing those stages
        of our society, maybe only to look at it and laugh, because by
        laugh we get rid of the past)<br>
        Also both Jesus and Lucifer bear the title of Moring Star (the
        very last plot-twist of the new testament) and so on.</blockquote>

            seth, who was not only satan but also the third son of some
            biblical figure, so the trick of this rite is that we should
            realy take it easy because we're not capable of

      <font color="#999999">Informational singularity is probably here,
        according to how fast information travels. It was just yesterday

        proteineinsaider insane with my spheric capsule thing. Or maybe
        he just looks this way, because his poor drawing skills and with
        his being a lady maybe, otherwise why'd he use so much pink.
        That would explain it a lot. I also foud some AnyaLove000001 who
        is whether that proteineinsaider or a huge fan of his (her first
        posting is years after it appeared at 2ch, but it literally uses

        просторов интернета на тему вечной автономной капсулы, as if she
        knew about it because somebody in the comments told her about
        it, but I suppose it's for conspiracy (для конспирации, a
        disguise) but why I mention it here is that I should be careful
        with all this information, because it can lead people further
        out of balance. I wish that lady well. And I will probably
        contact her to use her in our documentary (a friend from tv is
        making a film with me and some other weird guys, and I openly
        highjack his project into a direction he will also like) so that
        lady who tells that Jesus is Lucifer published it probably a
        year ago (according to the comments) and she could also be
        influenced by me, so at this point I should be careful with
        references, not to bring some circular references. Either way,
        references never proved anything, no matter how important they

      explored that rostral opening) and this hypothesis can be
      confirmed if some terracotta used to complete the sculpture, or
      refuted if such artifacts are never found. A decade ago I noticed

      position В is probably the Ш or T or D or whatever lingual, just

        too, but only it's </font>ugaritic<font color="#cccccc">, and
        this ugh cannot relate to those ogh and agh, because it stands

      Russian band Нуки can be transliterated as Noockie, if we want to
      make a magic four-letter name (кино, cure, abba) into
      seven-lettern name (madonna, michael jackson)<br>
      but it shows how it's similar to russians, which is rooskie in
      russian (c is always read as in cinema in russian, like s) rookie
      is новичок, новобранец, рекрут, n instead of r makes it
      new-russians, as if n is another r, Н another R, h ~ R, п looks
      exactly like n in cursive, п is p in lating, p is r in russian. We
      are noockie, but it looks like носки (socks) and many russian
      surnameds end на sky.<br>
      And ruckie is probably <br>
      <br>
      как может N быть Т это понятно, обе язычны, но как мог П оказаться
      в этой группе, Fart sound stands for No. N &amp; V meet in ν<br>
      see how many cases of lingual and labial having met!<br>
      also m is both M &amp; T, n is both N &amp; P (looks like since N
      and M are invariants, and one is lingual, the other is labial, all
      the letters after them are their whispering invariants: but why
      not T to M &amp; not P to N, but in reverse? if M and N are
      ivariants, then so is T &amp; П, 3 &amp; 2, both are пара, so what
      the difference.<br>
      I M N<br>
      O P T<br>

      dice are du? two dies? a pair of bones (one animal has exactly two
      of those bones used for divinations)<br>
      and initially it was not 6 digits per die, but only 4 (ctrlF vol.1
      for ашички)<br>
      <br>
      and because there were only 3 vowels... or could there be 4 vowels
      already when that divination appeared? then... one bone is left,
      the other right and... which is vowel which is consonant? or is it
      labial and lingual and vowels don't play here, they are for
      singing and from other culture or whatever.<br>
      Could common traits give birth to different notation languages?

      Ruck is чернь (rookie is probably related, as fookie would be
      related to fuck) which correlates to rus standing for village in
      latin. kievan rus is kievskaya oblast, skaya is the female form of
      -sky, thus both suffixes are fimininized, thus is y (which is ya)

      Some glagolythic for me to ponder on:<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">(the same I attached before, this time only
        the images I need, books should be with pictures)</font><br>
      <a href="http://www.croatianhistory.net/glagoljica/crogl1.pdf"><img

      I missed MSPaint so I found KolourPaint, it works well, like that
      one, maybe even better, but text cannot be copy-pasted when you
      still type it there. And now I cannot exit it directly, let's keep
      this drafty leaf there, for those who doesn't see it, it tells
      that glagolitic vowels are double forms of european, so he who
      invented it probably did it on purpose so someone who knows
      european and knows the keys can read it (thus it could be invented
      if not by kirl, by some other nationalist, I should be not biased,
      but based) I missed E: in glagolica it has not three strokes, but
      four (or not 1 but 2 depending on how you look at that)<br>
      and their ω looks like double ω.<br>
      <br>
      And I don't know why that pdf cuts the M's balls, but in this form
      M also looks like double M, two inverted M's, doubleW:<br>
      <img src="V_files/glagolythic-edit2.png" alt="" width="362"
        height="388"><br>
      And L looks like double lamed, so now I wouldn't be surprised if
      that was some later form of alphabet, fabricated by doubling the
      wide-known european ones, But what if other european alphabets
      just simplified this form? But where are archeologic evidence of
      the spread of glagolitic writing? In greek cursive δ looks like Ⰴ
      as it's written on the table below: <font color="#cccccc">(and in
        that first one with text on it)</font><br>

      Iroha system... I thought there was many, but it seems like

      the point. eVe, de'Ve.<br>
      but where did that fifth vowel were? In hebrew it's F, and in
      russian vowel Ё stands at that place, but it doesn't make much
      sense, because why is E a form of A and thus Ё was the true E? but
      ЁЖЗ for a lign don't make more sense (lign is unconsciously

      nevermind, back to lucifer. If it's Ё next to E, was E one of
      archangels who betraied Lucifer? For whatever reason I want to
      believe (believe, but not 100%) that the history of writing system
      is preserved in the mythology, especially since Sefer Yetzirah

      but temper is next to honor, thus that typo above is of no value:
      whores are the opposite of гонор, мэйби онли ту зэя хасбандс, but
      actually whore is no honour,&nbsp; honor ~is~ not a whore, bitch
      has some honour, but I don't like bitches, but I do not like whore
      either, in every woman I find some flaw not to be disturbed from
      my magical science oh magnificient science, looks what I'm doing,
      probably wouldn't be able to do if my cock was sucked. But I never
      really tried fat women, oh they're so easy to dismiss, fat looked
      ugly to me as to many other guys, only recently have I began
      looking at their plump cunts as when they're in clothes, I only
      avert when I imagine their bellies bigger than their tits, it's as
      if I fuck some fat dude, I don't mind titless gals really, even
      though pedoa is taboo to me, but if they're slim I watched a lot
      of fashion magazines to find bonies attractive af. Should I design
      clothes for fatsos to fuck? Should I pretend to be gay not to
      sleep with my models or should I claim my asexuality and then
      should I demand my A in their lgbt quiz or should I sustain from
      their озабоченного community?<br>
      I guess it will be a bridge for h to join their party, and what
      other reasons for heroin addicts to join gay community if not to
      sell drugs? to make monety (what a magnificient typo for mone!@Y)
      монетой,? из ит уот зыс нью тайпо теллс? I was talking of
      heterosexuals, but if gay is g, straight is S, and that is gay af.
      (some gay voice "you're the bottom" and it all relies to that

      <br>
      Back to that IFBW (and that the name for one of my bands, because
      they all may differ) and it a little surprises me that it's as if
      I tried to say I'm, but mentioned all the other labials instead
      (is V ~ N ~ M?)<br>
      And I was also surprised to notice, that Feed and Fuck are
      somewhat similar; Both is similar to Black, because if I fuck the
      blacks, I do fuck the whites, whites are more valuable where I
      live; (I read that ; was used to be a ?, but here it's a form of
      ,) Women and Wolves, or Wolverines (are those two species
      misinterpreted as ВорОны (Crows) and ВОроны (Ravens) in russian?)
      <br>
      And I tried to decipher some wide-known abbreviatours with that
      formula, and the first I found was FBI, which I immediately
      translated as Fuck Bad Individuals (actually the first guess was
      Fuck Black Individuals, but I thought that it's a racist
      misconception to call them blacks, because they're actually
      different shades of brown, but brown also begins with B, so that
      could be where I hit the core of that: B is yin, T(D) is yang,
      both black and bad are yin features, afaik) far isn't fuck or
      feed.. We'll wait for other hypothetic bandnames to find other
      basal meanings of cool official abbreviatures)<br>
      <br>
      That IFBW thing appeared <font color="#cccccc">(in this terms,
        the concept is at least a couple of years old, and the concept
        of which it's a part of is much more ancient decision to keep

        negotiate peace between the parties for mutual benefits) </font>after






































































      I met Nuki, and realized that they're pretty jewish, and АХС are
      the opposite (even though some people say Hitler was a jew) and
      good thing is I realized they don't need money (the jews have all
      the money in the world) so I will keep on donating to AXC only, to
      avoid being a glore.. I mean, glory-hunter, and here it seems how
      the words appear: a bro is a huge football fan, and he went to
      some game in London, where he found the term глоры, as if he was
      told "those are glores we don't like them" probably he was told
      "those are glory hunters", but he considered hunters be some sort
      of bastards, as if glory is the term per so, because -y is how you
      make plural in russian. (somehow some time ago I found the term
      glors or glores, as if it was shortened for glory-hunters, so I
      searched for glory-hunters and found many times urbandictionary
      saying it's those fans who always support the winning team, and
      only some gothic whores (goth-loli-whores?) for glores (non for
      glors)<br>
      Or I found it because глоры is a term in russian football fans
      terminology: has brother found it there? or have he sew it there?
      nah, 592 million cases of глор in google. Or is it a common
      mistake of the foreigners? probably so, or urbandictionary doesn't
      register brittish slang (I tried a few brit.slang.terms I know and
      it seems it knows) <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      that academia.edu thing, I like them: they just recommended me to

      I wanted to do for such a long time, and now I see it has
      references to King Jesus I probably stumbled upon trying to read
      it the last time. Now I ctrlFed it for alphabet, and try it out by

      they weigh the same!) <br>

      And here I understand another reason for my work unfit for the
      other academia: it discovers that information from somebody they
      disregarded happened to be the authentic and more accurate then
      the record they preserved (or have they left it out to disturb
      those fields and thus they preserved some doors we can now travel

      recommendd me I think of jews who probably produce all that good
      black stuff, and Suddenly I realize we cannot kill the jews,
      because they contain enourmous ammount of knowledge and culture:
      in russia they probably killed most of intelligent people, but
      they probably kept few good ones to teach their children, so their
      children would be the only cultured ones (and some goy-dogs can
      eat whatever falls from their masters' tables) I'm so mean at the
      way I deliver this stuff, but I dare to say it because... ah, I
      would dare anyway, but I make it so boldly because this good je<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDeCl3w2wo0"><font
          color="#000000">w</font></a> told me (yes, good jews are
      another reason holocoast must be prevented, some jews are great,
      as any other population has its percentage of brighties, it's only
      the most of overexposed jews that annoy us, but no need to throw
      the babies with the water, god knows we're all shit, different
      proportions of shit in each of us, but probably noone has that
      proportion at zero) That thought began few hours before that when
      I thought of musical education mostly jews was welcome into, so it
      seems to me when I look at my friends, musical school gives so
      many benefits to the child's development: they <br>

      This session (from "I'm going to keep these rants..") is so
      productive (I smoked weed twice though) because this is the
      session I also figured out E. Elias Merhige probably didn't film
      Begotten and Cryptorchid, but stole it from the artsy cinema he
      liked to get into as a kid (just compare those two and the birds
      to to his other crap and how he struggled to imitate that style in
      Antichrist Superstar, but it don't belong here, I analyzed it well
      elsewhere, and here I said enough for anyone to line the dots) and
      also found that Pizza Face (one of the first videos with Flea,
      which let me into RHCP rabbit hole with Irons and his role in
      Pearl Jam, and their song Immortality, Is it about heroin? some
      satanic shit I discover, and why do I share it so unnecessarily?
      Oh gosh, some part of me wants to die, but my allies are too
      strong for any perpetrator to stay safe. I also said I will turn
      it all into something friendly with my plot twists. So don't get
      jumpy, ai or any enhanced intelligence will figure it all in a
      whim)<br>

      <br>
      Funny that it also goes vowel-labial-linguals, if we look by
      pronounciation of the actual words.<br>
      Funny, that the final letter of the first line is to (十) in 十日
      [とおか] but in all other cases it's じゅう so I'm not sure if this
      similarity I found in a dictionary is reliable. <br>
      Funny, that that form of to in first line is read as do, as D in
      the first line of the alphabet.<br>
      Funny, that it's I, that is read as 1 sometimes, and 一 is read as
      い [i] <br>
      Funny, that ro can be a later grammatic suffix or vowel added in
      sanskrit.<br>
      Funny, that only one syllable in the labial word<br>
      Funny, that third word is all lingual syllables.<br>
      Funny, that there're 7 signs in the first line, just as if 7
      musical notes, for which those 7 syllables are used, and 8th most
      probably isn't (jisho.org translates only those 7 as musical
      notes)<br>
      <br>
      Let's rewrite the first line, this time in text:<br>
      いろはにほへと &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iro ha nihoheto &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      色は匂えど &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iro wa nioedo &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      So I guess that the first form of this line could have been in
      this form: いはと (i wa do) <br>
      And in this I cross out linguists reconstruction of ancient form
      of は as of ha (because hu is fu, and there was something else I
      don't remember at the moment)<br>
      いはと<br>
      Funny, that cursive א is very similar to い (the same strokes only
      in different order, and japanese is written in the different
      direction)<br>
      Funny, that は graphically reminds B, or even more so Б<br>
      Funny, that と reminds both c &amp; d (and thus stands for both,
      see ᚦ)<br>
      <br>
      <br>

      I claim so much in this book, all of it is so new and unheard of
      before, but is it wrong or write? on ly ti me wi ll sh ow<br>
      <br>
      what if not and into are relatives and one is negation of the
      other?<br>
      what if into is i-not as بلى (bala) is yes in arabic (bu is no in
      chinese, lo is no in hebrew, if those two syllables are
      etymologically negations giving middleasternly evasive
      confirmation of "not no"?<br>
      <br>
      <i>ba</i> is also <i>in</i> in there, and <i>in</i> stands for
      both <i>inside</i> and <i>not</i> in here<br>

      But it the semi-trolling mode I didn't even notice it, trying to

        That rant about Bologne where I never was was caused by
        something I heard, and though I realize it's completely not sane
        to be tHAT politically incorrect, I must also set an example of
        not being affraid of anything, so I proceded to read some about
        Bologne University and in russian wiki (in 02 2020) it's said
        that the university appeared as a law school to compete the one
        in Ravenna (in english wiki I don't see that) and that Ravenna
        was in opposition to Rome and Bologne was in good conditions
        with Rome (which already controlled another university, in
        Paris, because that one was theologic, and at first Bologne was
        independent university, but eventually Rome got their levers in
        it too, when they demanded a theology department after fine arts
        began teaching medicine too, as far as I got it, could be wrong
        on the bla bal asusal<br>
        So here I've shown that catholic church did establish university
        system, they never really was in opposition, lead what you
        cannot stop, hold your enemies closer than your friends. wise
        politics keeps this obviously fraudulent structure of the church
        in favor of jurisprudence, because those jus juris are in the
        centre of the structure of our society, the true spiders, and I
        dare to fly out of their network, rude.<br>
        <br>
        And I was looking for what ancient university has name similar

      episode can reveal where the fabric of the math itself tears out
      of the grasp os some spider net of overcomplications and I wonder
      how far can it tear. if x^0 being 1 is amon those false concepts
      referring to one another, I won't be surprised, but of course this
      course could be a manifestation of some grandeur delusion on my
      side, even though psychology is not a true science just as its
      marriage to pharmacology also isn't. some Dunning–Kruger effect it
      can be. or the opposite.<br>

      One good think I can say about Bologne U: is that there students
      were the boss.A good example and a perfect standart for any other
      uni of the kind. Also those universities, no matter how flawed,
      probably were a grasp of fresh air in the comparison to the darker
      ages before that.<br>
      And though the scent appearing there from the very beginning is
      the root of the poor state science and education are in today, I
      probably should show some respect to those legacies? Or maybe I
      shouldn't.<br>

      I found my self among math, thinking of what 1-1+1-1+1-1 row is
      and what 1/2 is to it. It is some "constant" (as ramanujan called
      it, not sum) around which the row jumps back and forth, as if at
      that point the sp<font color="#cccccc">r</font>ing is fixed.<br>
      pr is just a form of whriting that sound, which could be

      It's where it makes sense to them, as if it's some modified
      definition of zero, as if where two theories fluctuate around the
      truth. Can we find truth my summation of all possible theories?<br>
      And that fluctuation happens somewhere on the other end of the
      string we were supposed to find by the summation. Why would we
      look at the other end? Is it because that's where 1-1+1-1.. equals
      1/2? at the base of it? where the function was written down by the
      initial number in the substantial part and the rest of he function
      in so called imaginary part - look at how he who invented complex

      Then it correlates the figure of the sieger to nazi swastika, but
      it dissonates that concept of lucky-unlucky. Could nazi swastika

      no. <br>
      So &amp; no are the opposites. So = yeS. No is "clockwise",

      they are inversed because they wrote right to left and greeks went
      left to right) if my comparisons don't look like relating to
      either of these representations of phoenician (the one above and
      one below) compare them between themselves and see that there are

      ᚴ makes k inversed h? but k in h form is also seen. <br>
      also 𐤅, which stands where F is, looks just like Y (especially in
      the image) which combines Y &amp; F even stronger than 𐤉 standing
      for i, or they even transliterate as Y in that image, looking just
      like inverted F.<br>
      And if we recognize Ḥ as fowel (vowel) - just as H is E, and EWZ
      is a linge alright - then ḤṬY (𐤇 𐤈 𐤉) could be another line,
      which places L into vowel position and LMN becomes a valid line.
      word line can be that very lmn structure, if m does relate to y
      (which it does over v &amp; n, but that's still not convincing

      Socrates taught both monotheism and pederasty, and it could be not
      a coincidence: before monotheism at least duality was present,
      after that some hermaphrodite appeared instead of Hermes and
      Aphrodite.<br>
      <br>
      There also was a more explicit form of обожение in polytheism,
      monotheism stopped that, but only until baby Jesus came, but not
      for long, the antichrist of Saul tuned it all back but forcing his
      way claiming that J was that very monotheistic g.o.d. himselſ.
      Even though J himself taught that he is OUR celestial father, and
      that he baby j is no different in that we all can do what he did.<br>

      <br>
      &gt; Луна соответствует чакре сердца, а лунные узлы Раху и Кету<br>
      Раха и Кет - нзвание этих дополнительных чакр? <br>
      Эти три чакры - три фазы Луны? (триединое божество в
      дохристианской традиции было женского пола (тридеви хронологически
      раньше тримурти) и общеиндоевропейским:
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moirai (три женщины, молодая,
      взрослая, старая как фазы луны растущая, полная, стареющая)<br>
      Фазы луны намекают на четвёртую ноту (мёртвую?) сокрытую
      (захороненую?) и в алфавите (который по легенде был этим же
      триединым божеством создан (aeiou.ru) uvw имеют четвёртую сестру:
      y (а ъыь имеют то ли б то ли ѣ, но б-ѣ имя табуированное, но и не
      факт что это связано, потому что иначе это и есть dieu bla,
      Deva'l, Eve'l, ибо в тай-чи солнцу противопоставлена луна, но lune
      = moon, maður = man говорит о том что это слово матриархальной
      культуры? Тогда как S-n это и Son, и Sun, и Satan, божество
      которому плевать на наши молитвы? тогда как луна непосредственно
      связана с жидкостями на нашей планеты, что объясняет
      противопоставление воды и огня, но луна ассоциировалась с
      зеркалом, в которое лишь смотрится земля? потому что материнский
      культ связан с землёй, змеёй? god ~ гад? это какое-то гадание,
      извините за сырую информацию, но я не ожидал что гадание так
      похоже на гад, это камлание? нет, это что-то другое скорее всего,
      но земля как раз жертвы (удобрения) принимает, может индусы потому
      и уважают матушек коров, <br>
      http://www.symbolarium.ru/index.php/Корова - Основные значения:
      Великая Мать, богини Луны;<br>
      я видел конечно корову с луной (ниже пишут, что с солнцем) меж
      рогов, и что рога в форме месяца, серпа? mes меч в монгольском
      вроде и нож в нидерландском, месник и мясо могут тоже быть от
      этого месяца<br>
      https://www.newacropol.ru/Alexandria/symbols/cow/ - Она также
      представляла луну и небо; ее рога напоминали полумесяц, а молоко
      ассоциировалось с Млечным Путем. Встречающиеся изображения коровы
      с диском Солнца между рогами являются отражением идеи о небесной
      корове-матери, которая заботится о Солнце в течение ночи. Великая
      Мать и лунные богини зачастую изображались с коровьими рогами.<br>
      https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Хатхор - В древнейший период Хатхор
      почиталась как небесная корова, родившая солнце<br>
      &gt;&nbsp; Даже если заблокирована какая-то чакра на спинном
      мозгу, необходимо поработать руками.<br>
      эти две дополнительные чакры отвечают за руки? (ссылка на

      Когда я думаю стоит ли мне отправлять копию этой книги в синагогу,
      как я в некоторой степени обещал. Я думаю не дразни гусей: гуси
      довольно мирные ребята, но если их разозлить, можно получить как
      следует. <br>
      <br>
      И меня осеняет: гус джус, не те ли это гуси что спасли мир
      (интересно будет почитать как именно) гуси что спасли рим я хотел
      написать, но джус сэйвд зы уорлд? эм ай крэйзи? бат зэя ауа

      русские зайчики, евреи гусята, носята, гнусята, гундоситъ,&nbsp;
      надо для остальных наций подумать.<br>
      americans eagles? зайчики завидуют птицам обзывают петухами всех?

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      А̃<br>
      это один символ сверху, и это каким-то образом я начало чататься в
      обратную сторону: <br>
      вики на эту букву выдаёт Ꙗ, ꙗ, а в А̃ здесь есть прабел, попробуй
      выделить эту букву, она необычная. И словно ~ есть и (и всё это
      читается в обратную сторону)<br>
      И это перекликается с тем, что Я и I (ай) также произносятся в
      противоположные стороны.<br>
      Ⱑ is what's used in glagolica instead of Ꙗ (three pieces of Ⱑ tell
      it couild be three mothers, and fourth is traditionally hidden, if
      it's in 3d) Ⱑ три матери? и гласная А, и язычная J и губная? Ю is
      IO and it's the very Я in italian, jo in spannish, Я could be a
      way to write Ⱑ<br>
      I need to find out what tradition uses А̃ in the first place.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      евреи не только гуси, но и лисы, что удивительно в свете того, что
      л и г перекликаются своими формами и вот такими примерами. go no
      lo? what are other examples? I just found a new<font

      третья буква в этой группе - й и она попадает прямо в цель: йуси,
      йоси <font color="#cccccc">ez</font><br>
      Если так я могу эту букву крутить, то давай покрутим и остальные:
      лисы лусы? теряют добычку когда за ними гонятся? волк бы уволок,
      он сильный.<br>
      лисы гуси козы? что между ними общего? гуси вкусни, козы вкозны
      входят, но это подгон под ответ какой-то, ассоциативные связи.
      ассоциативное мышление самый примитос, гони на абстрактном. но
      абстрактное ближе к математике, а ей можно что угодно... это я
      повёлся на какой-то засёр науки, который хапанул и в котором
      заслуженно даже поучаствовал, матеша не докажет, что 2+2=3
      например, это бред и ошибочность его доказывается на основе

      Я назыаю русских зайцами (русаки - порода зайцев, в детстве
      мальчиков зайчиками наряжают (а девочек белочками. но чаще
      снежинками, так дешевле)) но зачастую их называют медведями.<br>
      Волки и лисы только прикрываются зайчиками чтоб обстряпывать свои
      грязные дела? Алсо зайчики когда не загорелы беленькие, лисоньки
      кстати тоже беленькими бывают, волки бывают белыми если полярны,
      но их серая шкура позволяет чеченцам ассоциироваться с волками.
      Русские зачастую хотят ассоциироваться с медведями, но тогда им
      нужно жить на севере, потому что все белые медведи там, здесь их
      скорей всего вырезали. Может затем и вырезали, чтоб русские с
      белыми медведями себя не ассоциировали. В этом свете слава
      Трактору за продвижение образа белого медведя (в современном мире
      в любом случае ни бурым ни белым медведям нечего делать на воле.
      это я так решил? это людям нечего делать на улицах. искусственные
      вирусы уже не шутка нихуя) <br>
      USA is further to south, and they have bears walking their streets
      robbing their trashcans, and there are no white bears in USA
      except Alaska, which used to be russian, thus it was a noble
      gesture to sell it to USA so they have their own white bears too.
      But still bear is associated with brown gay raper there<br>

      что всё надо раскапывать? к тому же это лажа из серии все изыки
      произошли от русского. Кто сказал все? Не всё, а тольок часть
      каких-то слов. и в данном случае это не в пользу русских говорит
      (хотя как посмотреть) что в говне разбираться они первые начали.
      Пометить, марать - в русских эти слова и про письмо и про говно,
      охотничьи узнавания того, что было оставлено неумышленно есть
      основа языка. <br>
      Только ли на охоте подобным заниматься приходилось? Не только, но
      там это было острее<br>
      В центральной России, до того как она была завоёвана русскими,
      были охотничьи системы письма, где-то в первом томе об этом
      сказано вскользь, и до сих пор ничего об этом не узнавал.<br>

      never go labial in the even position, it seems this culture puts
      females first.<br>
      the only somewhat lingual in the odd position are H T N, and they
      all are somewhat labial: <br>
      H gives birth to P F B W in japanese, it stands in that labial
      claster between N &amp; M <br>
      N is some invariant of M <font color="#cccccc">- I am still not
        sure if invariant is the word, but I've been using it in this
        work for some reason so if I find that it's not correct term,
        I'll replace it all together) </font><br>
      T there is probably Theta, θ which is actually some of these:

      another case of B as first letter have found me:<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      And that pdf gave the source of that image and I went to that site
      for more, and I searched it for alphabet and the first gem I found
      also had b as the first letter:<br>

      this interesting B to T thing suddely makes eochian alphabet more
      reliable to me, and that is from glorious John Dee, whom I liked
      before, but mostly because we share the name.<br>
      <br>
      I wonted to collect all the alphabets, so it's a good context for
      this part I craved to know but was too materialistically snobbish
      to d<font color="#cccccc">w</font>elve into.<br>
      But the fact that b &amp; d are not opposed make me turn on
      scepcis back. p &amp; q are but in the opposite way I'd expect
      them to be when I compared them to Ⰲ&amp;Ⰴ, but then again P could
      stand for d (papa &amp; daddy) while q could be a form of b (baba
      &amp; queen) <br>
      <br>
      But Agrippa's Of Occult Philosophy, Book II. (part 2) seemed
      unreliable to me: it contradicts what I know and what I don't know
      also don't ring no bell, as if he made it all up (except some
      banal יהוה thing)<br>
      But then I notice he also knows Īv̄ X̄ <font color="#cccccc">здесь

        I think was the word</font><br>
      <br>
      and while I was looking for those macroned letter I found
      something interesting:<br>
      https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/burts#Latvia<a
        href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/burts#Latvian"><font
          color="#000000">n</font></a><br>
      <font size="+1">Originally the masculine past participle of the
        verb burt (“to conjure magic”) (q.v.). Just as burt originally
        meant “to carve (marks, on a tree),” burts was originally
        “mark(s) carved on a tree.” Cognates include Lithuanian bùrtas
        (“lot, (pl.) sorcery”).[1]</font><br>
      isn't this find at this very moment magic? If I asked if Agrippa
      based, I think I found my response.<br>
      <br>
      And the third find was some riveting Dr. Dee's literature I don't
      dare to descend into, because I don't understand it and don't feel
      fond of that enough to read it all now (I have some more both
      comprehensible and reliable literature in my shelves) but I post
      the images that could lead somewhere:<br>

      That last one is something pythagorean, so it is here to look at
      it later or who knows<br>
      <br>
      then fourth book in the search was Agrippa, and it didn' ring no
      bell again, so it isn't here<br>
      the fifth was John (or Jean) Dee and before I looked into it, I
      expect it to bring something for me:<br>
      but it's the same book, yet a couple of images are in better
      quality:<br>

      Everybody heard of Agrippa, almost nobody among common public have
      heard of Dee.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">(don't believe the hype, aye)</font><br>
      The sixth find is again something of Agrippa and I realize how he
      is relevant: <br>
      he probably was the one, who popularized hebrew, and now I don't
      find it something special. it was.<br>
      All the other books I found that way seemed to be some
      nothingburger, just playing around hebrew alphabets, as those
      witch alphabet<a
        href="http://www.esotericarchives.com/fonts/index.html"><font
          color="#000000">s</font></a><font color="#000000"> <font
          color="#cccccc">(I don't find them authentic, so I don't feel
          like inserting them into this book, or else I'd have to
          collect all the other artistic artificial alphabets, which I
          will not)</font></font> <br>
      and here's a brightest example: they claim hebrew letters are the
      best (obvious propaganda) and yet they don't even notice that
      their chart is all out of order:<br>
      <a href="http://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/agripp1d.htm"><img
          src="V_files/table1.gif" alt="" border="0" width="593"
          height="949"></a><br>
      or amy I just an ignorant fool and this table wasn't supposed to
      tell מ is L and נ is M, but it could show how different cultures
      numerate those astrologic signs? (see Z &amp; F, those are greek
      and latin)<br>
      And in that book Agrippa touches the subject of three mothers, but
      in his book it's somewhat different from what Sefer Yetzirah
      tells:<br>
      <font size="+1">Of these, amongst the Hebrews, are three mothers,
        viz., [Alef, Vav, Yod] א, ו, י&nbsp; </font><font
        color="#cccccc"><font size="+1">seven double, viz. ב ג ד כ פ ר ת
          The other 12, viz. ה ז ח ט ל מ נ ס ע צ ק ר are simple. </font><br>
      </font>but they agree in the main feature of those letters, that
      it's vOwel, laBial, linGual<br>
      it could be that these beliefs come from the same source, because
      when there were only these three letters, they were both either
      and neither ו &amp; מ, or and nor (י &amp; ש (ת (and aleph
      probably was stated expicitly, or these two sources I have simply
      coincide in that one)<br>
      <br>
      I've decided to enter a image from Agrippa book I only mentioned:<br>
      <a href="http://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/agripp2b.htm"><img
          src="V_files/op2_p258L.jpeg" alt="" border="0" width="645"
          height="328"></a><br>
      because it made me thinking: not only have I never seen 10 as Δ, I
      also didn't think of 5 a of П, and it's fascinating how this
      labial reminds runic ᚢ which stands for V otherwise used for 5,
      and it aligns them in some other alphabetic sequence of ΙΠΔ <font
        color="#cccccc">(пять = 5)</font><br>
      which makes Agrippa even more reliable than Dee for me, I yet have
      to figure out if enochian alphabet is based or not: it begins with
      B reminding V and C reminding K, but the rest is way more messy,
      both in order and graphic.<br>
      They both are not respected by modern scientists, like those
      freaks I mentioned earlier, I wonder if they are destined to leave
      their own retarded traditions. They alrady did. Do I envy? I awe
      how they ever..<br>
      So here I look at what he tells further and it looks lame and gay
      how he writes 50 and 500 and Η four hundred could be unrecognized
      shortening for hundred (as M for mile) thus 50 and 500 are that
      very Π over 5 of what. M as 10000 kind of contradicts the other
      tradition, where it's 1000, but it relates to some other one, the
      chinese-japanese where 10000 is named san, so that M could be Ϻ,
      but my memory failed me, it's not san, but man: 万 (san is three:
      三) so it correlates it even more, or am I only trippin..<br>
      that X/M doesn't relate to roman numerals, because X is also a
      shortening for Χίλια (thousand)<br>
      П is not directly for пять, but for penta, πέντε, of course, and M
      could be for something greek too, but I haven't found what word
      that could be.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Academia doesn't allow this way of writing: when I say one thing,
      but then refute myself in thinking somewhat otherwise, but their
      rules are understood, but despised: they allow students to prove
      their words by referring to some book, as if books never lie (I
      won't go further explaining why it was made so and why it's bad,
      not in the mood to diss)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Another example of H standing for B: musical notation (hardly can
      it be a coincidence, somebody knew japanese or both he and
      japanese knew something else I yet to find out)<br>
      <br>
      <br>

      Did I know that fame destroys and maky faky so I made this work so
      toxic they yet have to extract the safe fruit out of it into their
      brochures?<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      And I look at the way we cheer up greeks to shoot the rapefugies,
      and I understand the germans who wanted a total war.<br>

      Лицо краснеет когда гонишь от себя дурные мысли., когда мозг

      подумал что наверное покраснел от стыда почувствовав себя оленем и

      сейчас вспоминал это настолько интенсивно фракталя мысль всё

      больше, освобождая место для новой нейроткани, куда записалась
      предыдущая мысль:<br>
      <br>
      чуреки лезут в европу, они отсталые и до сих пор хотят войну, и мы
      все хотим войну, с кем поведёшься от того и наберёшься. Так это
      всегда происходило? мир позволял свободное передвижение, свободное
      прибытие иноземцев заставляла аборигенов видеть гостей как
      пришельцев, как противников, чужие обычаи противны, иначе мы бы
      давно приняли их, стали бы одним народом, но мы разделены по
      причине личных (возможно генетически обусловленных) противоречий.
      итак, неприятие порождает неприятие, провоцирующее вооружённый
      конфликт, как было во вторую моровую с евреями и прочими
      коммунистами, так похоже готовится в третью с арабами и прочими
      мусульманами. История рифмуется, как сказал Марк Твен.<br>

      doesn't make much punishment when there are thousands of the

      That's a crap solution, see, we need something else.<br>

      And it's psychiatry's possibilities: if a person adapts some

      closed as some special secret soviet town, but then their country
      of origin should share their land to such a city in their country

      don't be affraid of them, change life so much that the old

      It may seem that this book is satanic, but Jesus is the only demon
      I allowed to enter, because christian bible teaches this, and it's
      its positive value: it leads its readers to ibbur to prevent
      dibbuk.<br>
      The idea of Jesus being a Luciferian figure is hermetic, but
      probably was considered heretic too.<br>
      But we shouldn't forget who considers this, in whose grasp this
      world is according to that very bible.<br>

      Если воспринимать бога не как образ для поклонения, а как символ

      обожающих мужиков собирающихся вместе. Более древние культы
      наверное не ограничивали присутствие женщин, но женщины отвлекают
      от настоящего обожения, но на него большинство племени неспособно,
      только на обожание, восхищение, и даже это если повезёт, прошедших

      Suddenly I realize my beef with Agrippa is that he placed yahweh
      into tetraktis, which tells me he didn't know what tetraktis was,
      that is why magicians are not recognized by scientists: they
      cannot distinguish their creative inventions from actual
      scientific revelations. I still don't know about Dr. Dee's
      enochian alphabet. The story of how they acquired that tells it's
      of their invention and shouldn't have been taken seriously.
      Compare it to how armanen runes were acquired according to their
      author (his word is not reliable enough to say it's authentic, but
      this research's proven them to be) read the parenthesis (a long
      word, but shorter than "what's in the brackets" and that's why
      russian has to change or go: when I write in paper, sometimes page
      ends before the long russian word ends, so I just shortened it by
      substituting all the russian suffixes with an english one. многа

      ведь моя проблема была в том, что меня ломало писать, что это за
      болезнь, при помощи которой можно зарабатывать - так я оставался в
      непонятке, пока не получил письмо от одного бывшего чиновника,
      которого пробило на откровенность и он начал присылать мне полотна
      текста о своём сыне, о машине, о всякой фигне, и я понял "а.. вон
      оно что.." <font color="#ffffff">(про то что бывший чиновник это
        я в ходе его откровений выяснил, решив поддержать разговор (он
        от кореша пришёл с просьбой помочь типа это и корешу надо,
        кореша предупредил что у чела жена бывший главпрокурор какой-то
        области и сам он назвал себя был цербером власти, поосторожней с
        ним, хотя откуда мне знать что кореш на свободе не потому что не
        от этих же) и для того чтоб сказать ему что графомания не есть
        гут, хороший вроде мужик при всём остальном, по крайней мере на
        этой ноте мы расстались)</font><br>

      parentheisis tells that among other words I've confirmed the
      authentity of runic script commonly known as armanen, but I'm not
      sure about this name, so I call it Bornholm runes (armanen have
      different G, and that swastic G I haven't met elsewhere, so I
      recognize it as the difference between bornholm runes and armanen
      runes)<br>
      <img src="V_files/armanen_runes.png" alt="" width="512"
        height="512"><br>
      <br>
      As you can see, you can compare them all to the alphabetic runes
      of bornholm, <br>
      except G, which is the only dotted letter in bornholm stone. and
      that stone doesn't have C, thus this G thing could also be caused
      by K column trying to break through. It's a weird letter, yet to
      be understood.<br>
      <img src="img/030.png" alt="" width="684" height="493"><br>
      <br>
      Now I see that armanen runes are in their aettir, so I want to
      colour the stone with those aettir,<br>
      but it returned no symmetry, pure random chaos, in case you'd like
      to see it, I'll publish the negative results, as many theorists of
      science tell academia should:<br>
      <img src="V_files/030aettired.png" alt="" width="684" height="493"><br>
      So it made me think tht Bureus is like those magicians invented
      things he thought he's discovered.<br>
      But then I realize Bureus separated those aettir differently:<br>
      <a
href="https://gangleri.nl/articles/44/the-rune-cross-of-johannes-bureus/"><img
          src="V_files/bureusfuthark.gif" alt="" border="0" width="530"
          height="159"></a><br>
      I had to walk this road at least to see this interesting numeral
      system <br>
      <font color="#999999">(I'll yet research if it's authentic, but
        click the image, it goes deeper)</font><br>
      so I'll repaint it differently:<br>
      <img src="V_files/030aettired..png" alt="" width="684"
        height="493"><br>
      and still nothing.<br>
      But Bureus builds some other symmetries, but I suspect a hairy paw
      of Vatican in this one:<br>
      <img src="V_files/200px-Runa_ABC.jpg" alt="" width="200"
        height="329"><img src="V_files/bureusrunecross.jpg" alt=""
        width="202" height="266"><img src="V_files/lapisbureus.GIF"
        alt="" width="233" height="263"><br>
      <br>
      But that linked image leads to where it's said that Bureus used
      numerology to tie runes to the christian date of him "inventing"
      those runes:<br>
      <a
href="https://gangleri.nl/articles/44/the-rune-cross-of-johannes-bureus/"><img
          src="V_files/bureusnumbercross.gif" alt="" border="0"
          width="309" height="201"></a><br>
      Once again a christian authority claims to author nation's trea<font
        color="#999999">th</font>ure.<br>
      But it's more like he invented this cross, for which he could also
      change the graphical part of some runes to make them lay into the
      symmetry:<br>
      <font size="+1">All of the letters of Bureus’ futhark can be found
        in the rune-cross, so also all the numbers can be found in it,
        as you can see below. The total of the cross comes to 2775, I
        don’t think this number has any special significance. A few
        things are that the right (for the viewer left) arm of the cross
        counts up to 366 or a year in the complete cycle of the sun, the
        left arm 794 which according to Bureus is the number of years
        between the conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn. Leaving out the
        K-rune, the vertical beam counts 1605, the year in which Bureus
        <i>invented</i> his runes. As you can see, you can make anything
        out of a figure like this. Bureus used a lot of number symbology
        in his writings, so it is not unlikely that he did they same
        with his cross, but this is about as far as I know of meanings.
        and the rest I didn't read</font><br>
      Or was it a way for him to preserve this writing system? I should
      be careful with my remarks.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      But I have to apply that retransliteration of futhark to see what
      those aettir are.<br>

      How jews could be associated with thieves? Воры иногда меняют
      внешний вид: ты не можешь сделать нос маленьким, но ты можешь
      сделать накладной нос. дёсны будут как у многих евреев от рождения
      если вставить в рот вставные зубы, т.о. многих евреев заметали по
      ошибке, или обвиняли по ошибке, используя словесный портрет от
      очевидца. Как в одной голливудской комедии словесный партрет
      рисовал кого-то с картин пикассо, и именно такого поймали на фоне
      совсем другого эпизода.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      the words jews and thieves are somewhat similar: some weird
      lingual and a labials<br>
      in russian they are also similar: евреи и воры, consonants are
      exactly the same.<br>
      <br>
      Но могут быть и другие факторы, и я не уверен что воры
      гримируются, актёры имеют право законно иметь гримёрный набор. он
      должен играть такого где-то, чтоб профессиоалы <br>
      <br>
      if I make such comparison (similar words could influence one
      another by associative links of misheard) then I would also
      compare women to witches, the same w I believe.<br>

      <font color="#cccccc">a guy I knew passed away (yet I don't know
        how) he shared a couple of ideas before he went: a teleporter,
        which was just a telephone booth, which yould let you see the
        other city of your choice, in that city would stand another
        booth - that was his weird idea the way I understood it, but
        what is much more interesting is where it led me: you can make
        it not some booth, but from home, and you can attach it in that
        other city not to some static booth or even pole (or many poles
        would do too) but to a drone in a form of a fly the tynier you
        can make it the longer it can stay unnoticed. I don't know if
        smal things can travel fast. Probably some bigger drone should
        be used to transport it. In a form of a bird, for example. <br>
        another idea was even weirder than that, he said you place
        plastic film on the ends of a barrel, and you pump out the air,
        so the film concave, and thus you have a plastic lens. I told
        him the laws of optic will see this film as two planes breaking
        the space in three parts without much of magnification. He had
        nothing to counter-argue, but it made me think what if we fill
        it with water? And what if we remove plastic, and use some
        transparent gas of high pressure from both ends of that water?
        wouldn't it concave with atomary precision?<br>
        I don't feel like I may patent it (though it's such things bring
        people fortunes) so I will share it on 4chan soon after I upload
        it on github, so it happens on two independent platforms, so I
        can prove that it was in public domain with a higher
        probability.<br>
        I don't feel like I should patent it for many reasons, and that
        it belongs to the guy I didn't even like or value (too bad, I'm
        ashamed, he could have more, I had nothing to do with it, but I
        could value him more. I should have shared the way I extended
        his revvelations with him, but he really pissed me off, but it
        was immature of me to be mad, I should have become a more of a
        friend to him)<br>

      I stared at this image in the context of A(XH)(CS)ИМСЗ and I saw
      it beginning from A and going to Z in a very specific manner: I
      didn't see C, I saw S, because that's the russian С. And it just
      jumped from the first column into the fourth whether to H or X.
      And what I actually saw first was the fifth column, which included
      YMS, the three mothers I conceptualized as the abbreviation of my
      band: ИМС where З is 3 and it's that other band A works with after
      X&amp;S dropped off (S even worked with that second band together
      with A) but I didn't think of them.<br>
      And before I saw иМС in that column I first saw Y &amp; M being
      the exceptions and one aboue the other and then I saw that S
      probably used to be written as Ϻ and it's still Σ in greek. <br>
      So I wasn't looking for it there, it came to me itself and for the
      other time this band's name returns into this book, whether to
      show hou much it all can be an apopheny or to show how mystic is
      actually true in magicians' lives.<br>
      And it goes further with it's З, because it's that very Z in the
      end, but I wrote about int before.<br>
      And like genetif code this septagrammaton can also be read
      differently: so that second состав didn't know what I know and
      they just named their new старуха with the final trigrammaton MCЗ
      also stands for the guy who came instead of Старуха Изергиль. and
      if А is still Alex and И is still Игорь, then in that compound
      Tanya Voyna is whether X as she was initially presented as another
      Xenya, Katarakta was the nickname, which made those other three
      KKK, KataraktaKonstantinovKulakov, and now when Konstantinov left
      (even before that) she's Tanya Voyna, which is TV, the final
      letters in a way. And that V is the labial she had to be if she
      came instead of Х(B) <br>
      <br>
      this is me smoking after a day off, but in the evening, my mind

          That link is to Pervushin telling of a physical theory which
          came to the same conclusions I did: not universe expanding,
          but objects shrinking (because any rotating movement creates
          move of matter towards it (even if it releases it ont the
          other side of it, just as stars emit light but attract matter
          of the space to burn into that light) it just was my own
          interpretation, I don't understand the math beyond his words,

      Let me hit the(ir) edducation system instead: I taught a kid to
      learn in one lesson: after the classes I took the money from a
      coffy table and told him: see, your mother is ready to speand on
      yout study, so if you studies yourself you could hav ethis money.
      But wageslave teachers cannot teach like this, or they will have
      no wage.<br>
      So it's another reason why the best way to learn is to learn for
      free. You're free to donate to a teacher. But it's smarter to pay
      him only after you know <font color="#cccccc">s</font>he is true,

      What that etruscan canon tells is that letters fro A to I could
      all be vowels:<br>
      the middle form of alleged H is strokingly between A &amp; E, the
      other two can be double E's<br>
      alleged TH (T) can be O or be related to I written as T on those
      clocks where it could be easily fixed if that was but and not
      feature.<br>
      And K begins the sequence of consonants as it does in eastern
      alphabets and syllabaries.<br>
      <br>
      I woke up with my eyes closed after a bright dream with
      beyonce-like nigerette singing some modern pop with an
      accompanient of one short sample repeated fast and changing its
      tone for melody and two niggers in the audience were dancing by
      sitting lower and lower to шпагат as if it was a contest or a
      challenge, a duel, and then he who was the offender sat two deep
      and tore apart. and the defender (the one who was challenged by
      the offender) was only half-torn and that was that his legs were
      lying on the floor, but he could move along by moving them across
      the floor. <br>
      And so I woke up and decided not to open my eyes, but to smoke
      some weed if I can find it, which I did, and I went to bath with
      my eyes closed and there I made that высь &amp; низ session, and I
      thought about how did people keep information before writing. And
      poems and songs was the answer. And I tried to write about высь
      (upwards) &amp; низ (downwards) выше и ниже, v &amp; ν, both are
      ends: v in archaic roman and in runes, and n is in the half of the
      alphabet:<br>
      a b c d&nbsp; e f g h i j kl m n<br>
      o p q r&nbsp; s&nbsp; t u v w&nbsp; x&nbsp; y&nbsp; z<br>
      here w reflects ij<br>
      here y reflects m<br>
      and M reflects W<br>
      here x is another double letter<br>
      thus it reflects kl and thus l ~ s, for l ~ c ~ s<br>
      In russian first half of the alphabet is voiced, and that could be
      what B represents<br>
      in russian last half of the alphabet is voiceless, and that could
      be what T represents.<br>
      And if it's an universal pattern, we can see the letters added
      later.<br>
      And we begin with greek, because all its first row is voiced, and
      that's the link with russian:<br>

      </font> here vowels are black, voiced are red, voiceless are blue,
      and it seems nobody but russians care about this division, evern
      georgian, which saved lineal and axial symmetries thoroughly
      didn't seem to care about preserving voiced-voiceless structures
      when it added many lingual to its end.<br>
      let's try it with the other two:<br>
      א<font color="#ff0000"> ב ג ד ה ו ז</font> <font color="#3333ff">ח
        ט</font> י<font color="#3333ff"> כ</font> <font color="#ff0000">ל

      <font color="#cccccc">I coloured <font color="#ffcccc">ה</font>
        red even though I consider it vowel, but it is voiced (as any
        vowel, duh)</font><br>
      And we see that where russians only have k, other europeans also
      have whether H or Θ<br>
      (though those who have Θ also had H as a voiceless, even though in
      runic form it's ᚼ<font color="#cccccc">(or ᛡ)</font> which exactly
      repeats russian Ж which stands exactly there, or before Z which
      was probably there when θ was the f. <font color="#666666">or Ж
        and З are invariants (Ж is transliterated as whether J or ZH (З
        is Z))</font><br>
      And suddenly I realize that italian doesn't have K <font
        color="#cccccc">(but they do have H, and in my notebooks I
        theorized that h k R are three forms of the same something)</font><br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_orthography"><img
          src="V_files/italian_orthography.png" alt="" border="0"
          width="898" height="755"></a><br>
      and though it tells that jkwxy are part of the alphabet, it seems
      they are not:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="V_files/index.gif" alt="" width="596" height="273"><br>
      <br>
      A B <font color="#3333ff">C</font> D E F G H I L M N O P Q R S T
      U V Z<br>
      But all the alphabet descending from latin have this C (which all
      the others: greeks, russians, jews, arabs, recognize it as a
      voiced letter, and runic alphabet doesn't include it at all. And
      here it's obvious that ᚦ is a voiced letter, ð,<font
        color="#cccccc"> just as Δ is,</font> even though it's told that
      it's representing [θ] or [ð]<br>
      whispering ᚦ is θ alright. And another revelation I had today is
      that if velars began the language, it could be because the most
      quiet letter you can pronounce is soft k, and thus whispering is
      rational thought, unlike scream. And what caused this revelation
      is me walking around with eyes closed being rather high and I saw
      the alphabet in an unusual way it was<br>
      A Г..<br>
      Е..<br>
      ..<br>
      this angle of it, and I saw that it actually was<br>
      A<font color="#c0c0c0">Б</font>Г..<br>
      Е..<br>
      ..<br>
      where Б was a form of Г, thus it's not с from b, but b from c? can
      I even trust that vision?<br>
      Г as the first consonant would arrange european alphabet along
      with the indian ones.<br>
      and in japanese it's Ba(バ) being the form of Ha(ハ), not the other
      way around.<br>
      or is it the other way around? is it voiced form the more
      primitive than the whispering ones?<br>
      because runic alphabet knows ABD, but not C. But what if ᚦ is c?
      because ᚲ looks pretty much like it's staveless form. And ᛒ could
      be the double form of ᚦ and then Б is a derivative of Г<br>
      and if Г is ᚦ it refers to Р(r) even more then by phonetic an the
      graphic side of r &amp; г, and thus q &amp; Р<font color="#cccccc">(R)</font>
      are even more relative, just as the halves of the alphabet. Those
      halves worked so well together in english form of latin, lets look
      at them again, and let's try it again, and let's also do it with
      italian (because I like its way of saying Z is whether [ds] or
      [ts] thus ts it is, just as ц and צ and ת actuallly, and just as v
      is f in german.<br>
      A B C D E F G H I L M N<br>
      O P Q R S
      T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      U V Z<br>
      italian Is weird. but let's find its own middle:<br>
      A B C D E F G H I L M <br>
      N O P Q R S T U V Z<br>
      And we just found where M is the Middle letter. in italian it is.<br>
      but i don't see much of resemblance between these halves.<br>
      Let's return to more common european double 13s:<br>
      A B C D E F G H I J KL M N<br>
      O P Q R S T U V W&nbsp; X&nbsp;&nbsp; Y&nbsp; Z <br>
      I read that C used to be read as G, thus voiced form here IS the
      original one. But that I read, it doesn't make it automatically
      true. but it allows us to suggest that those halves could be
      voiced and voiceless counterparts, then it demands rearrangement
      so not only f reflects t, but, well, I changed my mind already,
      but lets' see what I wanted to see::<br>

        Although strongly associated, indeed often referred to as the
        “Celtic Tree Alphabet”, Ogham is a distinct medieval tradition
        that uses the names of trees to denote its individual letters in
        a written alphabet. Since Ogham of itself covers neither the
        mythology nor botanical lore of trees, it is better understood
        as an ‘add-on’ to the subject of the tree alphabet, and not as
        an explanation or umbrella to it.<br>
        The Irish og-úaim (‘point-seam’), refers to the ridge or groove
        made by the point of a sharp weapon, which explains the
        technique, however it is traditionally credited as having been
        invented by Ogma, the patron of poetry and eloquence, and one of
        the three key gods of the Tuatha de Danaan (along with Lug and
        the Dagda). Ogma’s first message was written as seven b’s on a
        birch tree, a warning to Lug Lamfhota that “your wife will be
        carried away seven times to the otherworld unless the birch
        protects her”. Strictly therefore, the word ogham refers only to
        the form of letters or script, while the letters themselves are
        known collectively as the Beith-luis-nin after the letter names
        of the first letters (as ‘alphabet’ refers to Alpha and Beta in
        the greek alphabet). Because the word nin (as opposed to nuin)
        literally means ‘a forked branch’, Beith-luis-nin can be assumed
        to mean the ‘forked-branch’ style of written letters, or simply
        the ‘Beith-luis letters’. The ogham alphabet originally
        consisted of twenty distinct characters (feda), arranged in four
        groups or aicmí (families). Each aicme was named after its first
        character (Beithe, Huath, Muin, Ailm)</font><br>

      That was a easy part, to compare these two runic traditions (and
      the ammount of those traditions can tell how ancient the tradition
      is)<br>
      I like how ᚦ and ᛒ are at the opposite sides, and how ᚿ is in the
      centre, and ᛘ is in the end. even though the other way around
      would scream of the obvious similarities. M &amp; N are
      invariants, cognates maybe, or N is "in" M is море, N is налим
      (маим &amp;.. I heard that nun is fish, but in hebrew fish is dag)<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ᛘ<br>
      Too my surprise, everything but ᛘ and ᚓ correlates. At first I
      didn't know what to do with ᚦ until I saw d in ogham, I would
      equalize R to Q, but let's leave it laying uncoloured, because I'm
      not sure if it isn't within statistical expectation.<br>
      I don't know much about statistical expectations, but here not a
      single <font color="#cccccc">aet aekm </font>aicme has more that

      will can in russian is сможешь. can is можешь. it's interesting
      how russian verbs get into future forms with the help of prefixes:
      бьёшь, но убьёшь, едешь, но уедешь, even though in these examples
      у cand stand for away, but it could be relative to dutch ge-,
      because dutch -g is english -y: dag &amp; weg are day &amp; way.
      с- is another prefix to make future or совершённую форму, and c-
      isnot htat far from ge-<br>
      ем, но съем, еду, но съеду, заеду, за- ещё один префикс подобного
      рода. приеду, отъеду is future, but отъезжаю is present, where
      that longer suffix is similar to -ing. actually in seems every
      prefix turns russian present simple verb of present into future
      form<br>

      divide a pie in five pieces this way that there are exactly the
      same distance between the cuts and the ends of the pie, what will
      be the size of those pieces, and what would be the voume if it was
      a ball.<br>
      here's a previous task: what if we cut the ball in half, and then
      cut those halves in unequal halves by the same method (the same
      distance between previous cut and the end of the ball or a disc)<br>

      Why would it be so, that right triangle with sides 3 and 4 had
      another side of 5?<br>
      Understanding that would probably lead to simple understanding of
      the great theorem of Fermat.<br>

      also understand why 3<sup>3</sup>+4<sup>3</sup>+5<sup>3</sup>=6<sup>3</sup><br>

        title="Aa1 [x]" alt="x" height="18"> tasks immediately demand
      some complex geometry. There are formulas of chords, but my task
      here is to find them myself, and to show you whow we do it.<br>
      It would be easier if some of those lines were of the inscribed
      square, but if it's diagonal equals D, not a single side of it can
      be the fraction of it. because pythagoras theorem declares, that
      2a<sup>2</sup>=D<sup>2</sup>, thus a thus a deminishes D in
      irrational number of √2<br>
      &nbsp;and that exact number relates to post-pythagorean proof of
      irratinal numbers being neither even nor odd or something like
      that. I didn't understand that proof, so I left if for some later
      times when I whether find a better version of it, or when I
      augment my intellect. For now I would say that they began breaking
      th math when they introduced the irrational numbers, or even
      before thant, but I worked with irrational numbers (not the
      fractions they appear out of, or they appear not from fractions
      but from roots) so I found them at least convenient (but I never
      used them in real life maybe, or I somehow know 1.4 as something
      similar to √2 so I guess I did.<br>
      That proof that √2 cannot be seen as a fraction is something I yet
      have to understand and how did they make it by showing that it's
      neither odd nor even? can fraction be odd or even? 2/3 = two 1/3s?
      I seriously doubt you can play this way, because 1/3 = 2 1/6s. is
      6 what make that 2 non valid? so 1/3 is an odd fraction and 1/2 is
      en even fraction? or only 2/3 is? 2/4 is not a fraction it's 1/2.
      what is 3/5? ultra odd? 4/5 is even? okay, let's suppose such
      thing ass odd or even fraction exists, let's try to see how it
      looks:<br>
      evens: 2/3, 2/5, 4/5, 2/7, 4/7, 6/7 <br>
      odds: 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/7, 3/4, 3/5, 3/7, 5/6, 5/7<br>
      it is as if there are twice as many odd fractions than there are
      even ones.<br>
      but 1/3 can be seen as two 1/6's, so this whole idea of odd and
      even fractions is rather shaky, so I have to research it further
      if that idea ever existed or merely a product of my imagination.<br>
      Well, I guess it's not just my imagination, they actually do:<br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">A proof that the square root of 2 is irrational<br>
        <br>
        Let's suppose √2 is a rational number. Then we can write it
        √2&nbsp; = a/b where a, b are whole numbers, b not zero.<br>
        <br>
        We additionally assume that this a/b is simplified to lowest
        terms, since that can obviously be done with any fraction.
        Notice that in order for a/b to be in simplest terms, both of a
        and b cannot be even. One or both must be odd. Otherwise, we
        could simplify a/b further.<br>
        <br>
        From the equality √2&nbsp; = a/b it follows that 2 = a<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup>,&nbsp;




























        or&nbsp; a<sup>2</sup> = 2 · b<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp; So the square
        of a is an even number since it is two times something.<br>
        <br>
        From this we know that a itself is also an even number. Why?
        Because it can't be odd; if a itself was odd, then a · a would
        be odd too. Odd number times odd number is always odd. Check it
        if you don't believe me!<br>
        <br>
        Okay, if a itself is an even number, then a is 2 times some
        other whole number. In symbols, a = 2k where k is this other
        number. We don't need to know what k is; it won't matter. Soon
        comes the contradiction.<br>
        <br>
        If we substitute a = 2k into the original equation 2 = a<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup>,
        this is what we get:<br>
        2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2k)<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup><br>
        2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4k<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup><br>
        2*b<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4k<sup>2</sup><br>
        b<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2k<sup>2</sup><br>
        <br>
        This means that b<sup>2</sup> is even, from which follows again
        that b itself is even. And that is a contradiction!!!<br>
        <br>
        WHY is that a contradiction? Because we started the whole
        process assuming that a/b was simplified to lowest terms, and
        now it turns out that a and b both would be even. We ended at a
        contradiction; thus our original assumption (that √2 is
        rational) is not correct. Therefore √2 cannot be rational<a

      <br>
      This time I understood it, and I'm not sure they said that
      fraction were even, but the numbers in those fractions are even or
      odd, not the fraction itself. Here I leave this pondering to show
      you how good brains should work. I found that I just was wrong, or
      I just named fractions odd or even which oesn't make sense. or
      have I been proving that I'm also wrong when I tell I'm wrong?
      Thats not how it should work to prove that thus you werre right,
      admit being wrong, live with it a little, then you can play the
      other part, that will help you grow by seeing different
      perspectives, as I tend to believe in god from time to time,
      bringing new arguments to accept it: to contradict the commies, to
      see what it will look like if I'm wrong on that one, to see how
      those who invented tha alphabets did. and after years of living
      those beliefs, to find new arguments to disbelieve again: it
      doesn't make much sense and religious people are fags, it drives
      me crazy but religious people are based, and I'm actually still
      waiting for the third reason to fall out of it when I found some
      events, only easiliy explained by the spiritual realm (literally
      AXC) so I've got the fourth reason to believe, after I began
      fading out of faith by reasoning of who gives a fuck about these
      letters, delve into biotech instead, you're using your powers

      I believe I've already spoken in this book on who invented ti note

      find it, so I have to return to this research once more: <br>
      Solfège is, like alphbet, is named on the basis of two consequent
      letters of its sistem:<br>
      <font size="+1">In music, solfège (UK: /ˈsɒlfɛdʒ/,[1] US:
        /sɒlˈfɛʒ/; French: [sɔlfɛʒ]) or solfeggio (/sɒlˈfɛdʒioʊ/;
        Italian: [solˈfeddʒo]), also called sol-fa, solfa, solfeo, among
        many names</font> <br>
      but why would they name it from the middle, the modern
      letter-notation also goes from the middle, A is that very la, so
      whoever named the system sol-fa probably used some mode beginning
      with even more previous key.<br>
      <font size="+1">Through the Renaissance (and much later in some
        shapenote publications) various interlocking 4, 5 and 6-note

      <br>
      <br>
      That fact that I couldn't find a piece I wrote and it demands some
      other form of the book. It's way too big to be just one book. I
      will split it into form of several cross-linked blocks, and maybe
      that will one day be<font color="#006600">come</font> a standart.

      Italian alphabet is the only one I know that has 21 letters. And
      in it M is indeed the middle letter. And QR or PQ look to be out
      of place, and when I used that botched form of italian alphabet, I
      also came to the same conclusion, that when V was the final
      letter, it could have been like this:<br>

      just as Y in other latin structures can be either vowel or
      lingual, in italian it could be the same conflict of these two
      schools, when school of axial symmetry added Vowel V, and school
      of lineal symmetry insisted on reading it as consonant. They
      probably didn't distinguish labials and linguals in their
      theories, because otherwise they would do something with that M
      mess, and they wouldn't tolerate two labials in one line. But
      runic alphabet testifies that P is not labial P, but lingual Р[R]
      and in runic alphabet ᚢ(V) seems to be always consonant. That
      lineal school also distinguished only vowels and&nbsp;&nbsp;
      consonants (only they matter in axial symmetry) or they didn't
      feel like telling that labial secret to the axial band, because in
      our times we only know vowels and consonants. Other division among
      consonants we usually know is voiced and voiceless, which can be
      observed only in russian alphabet, whch could be nothing or
      further work of some protomasons who could have emigrated to
      peaceful rural lands. Or it could be an evidence that those rural
      lands are the third root of this alphabetic tree. Three mathers,
      three matters, and we noticed that there could be more than three,
      fourth column is considered to be alright, even though three is
      enough.fifth column is no-no, probably because it tends to stand
      where the fire is supposed to burn.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      And when I was trying to figure out what forms did italian
      alphabet take before the modern one, I found italian site speaking
      of etruscan alphabet as its roots (not greek the way post-greek
      russians are taught) <br>
      It speaks of umbrian <font color="#cccccc">(the image is
        clickable as usual)</font> and it compares them:<br>

      in that very same intervies the interviewer says abolishing and it

      Back to music (and to playing cards) an interesting personality
      named itanimull just visited a discussion we had with the guy who
      discovered that russian alphabet begins with voiced letters and
      ends with voiceless ones: <a
        href="https://roouh.livejournal.com/150582.html?thread=2000950#t2000950"><font

      and his name just told met hat that word can be translated as you
      me knаете.<br>
      K ~ З EЁЖЗИЙК З &amp; К are on other sides of I, which could be a
      single form of H. and Ж reflect K that both are after vowels as
      they shouldn't be, but Z in greek reflects the same tradition. Z
      could be a way to write I or it was = as in japanese にニ (japan is
      the most cultural province of the imperial china, chinese could
      have just usurped japanese culture the same way arabs usurped some
      persian stuff, maybe even writing system, I think I read something
      like that, but it's not for sure.<br>

      In icelandic illu is evil, ill kill, oh boy! that's why we see
      them as evil, killuminati is the term. But I just offered that
      bright guy a partnership in building those uteric capsules, and
      it's 1 of April, and he could be anything. But he is smart and he
      answered my questions comprehensibly. Maybe it's a headhunt (who
      hunts who? it's a bad term) <br>
      illud is it in latin. oni (they in russian, some abstract evil
      force (больный большой) and demons in japanese)<br>

      I smoke weed and the flow coming out of my mind is rather massive,
      and it could be the reason it's hard for me to read large texts,
      and if that inner flow stops, it means that tide goes the other
      way and it's time to read what I had. Though I hope it doesn't
      program my head to stop. Head, don't stop, I enjoy you r flow.

      It's been ten to rwenty years since I began this work<font

        about it about twenty years ago. I began reading it</font><font
        color="#cccccc"> (about writing systems)</font> <font
        color="#999999">about ten years ago)</font><br>
      and only a couple days ago have I known of причерноморские
      письмена (that regious is full of writing systems, turkic runes,
      finno-ugric runes, all sorts of runes, greek and latin and
      georgian, and even armenians were not that far, and if you read my
      book, you know georgians and armenians actually had writing
      systems before christians. and Parma had writing system or two.
      slaves are cyberhumilated. etruscan could be theirs, but romans
      had slavery, so that is their substrate, they enslaved etruscans,
      at rural side lived some pieceful, too peaceful how comes they're
      so evil now? how come all their history они раздавали кому-то
      пиздов и хвастались этим. сначала хазарам (евреев били и считают
      это достойным эпоса. based, biased. затем татаров били (хотя долго
      дань униженно платили, так что теперь их земли поработили типа
      заслуженно, но дань до сих пор платим, хотя грабим наверное на
      много большие суммы. И не мы, то немцы то евреи. мы мясо.<br>
      <br>
      В общем, мне сложно что-то рассказать, я просто пяснически
      накурен. мяснически.<br>
      Only yesterday have I heard of one interesting theory that
      причерноморская writing system is the link between cypriot
      syllabary which I wouldn't distinguish from linearB:<br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_syllabary"><img

          width="1139" height="761"></a><br>
      <br>
      Here's the page of that theory:<br>
      <a href="V_files/8czb8mdg.jpg"><img src="V_files/km11.jpg" alt=""
          border="0" width="767" height="1299"></a><br>
      <br>
      and a discussion after I was told about it, I googled some and
      criticize the critics:<br>
      <div class="comment-text j-c-resize-images">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        <font size="+1"><i>&gt; Главный недостаток гипотезы Н.А.
            Константинова в том, что она оставляет открытым вопрос,
            почему сарматы, а затем славяне заимствовали слоговое
            кипрское письмо, а не звуковое греческое. Ведь последнее
            было больше известно жителям Причерноморья и гораздо лучше
            передавало фонетику сарматской и славянской речи. </i><br>
          Потому что причерноморское старше греческого? там и Колхида
          ближе куда за золотым руном гоняли. А ты об этом и говоришь
          (или ты не так говоришь, ты говоришь что греческий минускул
          возник под влиянием глаголицы, что вполне может быть: говорят,
          что греческий минускл только в средние века возник (не знаю
          правда-нет) а в греческих рукописях δ один в один Ⰴ <br>
          <i>&gt; Другой крупный недостаток гипотезы Н.А. Константинова
            — это то, что она базируется на графическом сходстве
            некоторых причерноморских знаков со знаками, с одной
            стороны, кипрского и, с другой — глаголического письма. Ведь
            значение причерноморских знаков, которые служили, согласно
            Н.А. Константинову, посредствующим звеном между кипрскими и
            глаголическими знаками, пока еще не расшифровано. </i><br>
          Ну типа он его и попытался расшифровать, просто сравнив знаки
          с соседскими. ага.<br>
          Я впервые встретил эту тему, что удивительно конечно. А потому
          не могу пока прокомментировать. Я даже до кипрского письма ещё
          не добрался, когда встречал думал что линеар а или б
          какой-нибудь. </font></div>
      <br>
      <br>
      to be continued, that dialogue are going to bring forth something
      wonderful, it allows me to understand linears A and B, my bridge
      to that topic, we'll see how long that bridge will take.<br>
      I told you, I was told not to take on faith (not to memorize what
      I cannot understand, so I never learned linears, and I learned
      runic and greek when I began to see how they are very similar to
      the latin and russian and others I knew. And I just began (or
      continued) to recognize georgian letters<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      That other guy, named aaaaaaaaaaaa_a who told me of
      причерноморские writings, also shared with me this weird detail:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="V_files/456px-Cyrillic_cursive.png" alt="" width="456"
        height="600"><br>
      <br>
      it's fascinating, because remember how I mentioned ГПТ as another
      tritinty in russian capital cursive:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="V_files/%D0%93%D0%9F%D0%A2.png" alt="" width="251"

      <br>
      those strokes above u &amp; ш turning them into n &amp; m (reading
      as p &amp; t) look like those dots at 6's &amp; 9's in lottos.<br>
      and that serbian г cursive tells a different story: <br>
      it refrects i, and reflected i is sometimes j, and j is next to g,
      which is г (even though г stands where c does, yet as you probably
      know c &amp; g are invariants) all this also correlated that weird
      Г ~ L symmetry emerging all the time, because another reflection
      of j is l. (g is reflected by ж, which is more often
      transliterated as j or zh, and z reflects it in greek, even though
      russian e-line includes both zh &amp; z, which whether make them a
      claster (which it is) and/or H which can be transliterated as ᚼ
      reflects Ж, and it once again makes H belong to the I-claster,
      together with J, which can sound as both ж &amp; x[h]) <br>

      I like it how they use that ' only to avoid the heresy of

      Was it because vowels were used in egyptian magic? Tabooed as

      Science institutions declare self-experimentation unscientific
      based under anecdotal evidence premise.<br>
      I wanted to add something else here, closer to the subject of this
      bok, but I spoke about medicine, I promised to turn focus to
      medicine more, so let's speak medicine right here: a guy
      discovered vaccination by anecdotal evidence of a self-experiment:
      who would allow such an experiment on larger population?! so
      vaccines are unscientific, what a surprise, I'm glad, I didn't
      like them before.<br>
      <br>
      So what is the conclusion:? I see many, I make none. I just take
      this weird link between self-experimentation and anecdotal eidence
      memes into account.<br>

      Jewish word make people golems? Christians are their "greatest
      ally", so are muslims, who pray even lower and don't even see
      whose myths are those. The myth is mostly about what their supreme
      leader said, when jews say that koran is plagiarized judaism, they
      could be speaking not of tanah, but of talmud, which could be (I
      didn't read it enough to say quran is not the same, they have
      similar criminal code muslims and ancient jews, so it could be.
      Isn't it funny, how they fight eachother (just like people who
      care too much about music hate the most not those who don't care
      about music at all, but those who prefer some ot<font

      But if it's the case, than the word is not only bible, but also
      אמת which stands for "truth" and also is written at golem. But אמת
      is kinda structure of the alphabet: the first letter, the middle
      letter and the final letter. But though מ is na<font
        color="#cccccc">a</font>m<font color="#cccccc">e</font>d
      middle-letter, it's not exactly the middle in hebrew, there's no
      middle in hebrew:<br>
      <br>
      א ב&nbsp; ג&nbsp; ד ה ו&nbsp; ז&nbsp; ח ט י
      כ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      ת ש ר ק צ פ ע ס נ מ ל <br>
      <br>
      But though אמת follows the structure of three matters (vowel,
      labial, lingual; air(or earth) water fire; earth is water or air
      is fire? It used to be yin-yang. labial-lingual and vowels can
      fill in any of them. That is why vowels are separated from the
      main set sometimes in India, for example.<br>
      Three mothers of sefer yetzirah are אמש which could be a
      misleading road to some plot twist caused by the secrecy of this
      knowledge (sefer yetzirah openly tells that it's a great secret)
      or it could be more useful: imagine that s &amp; t are invariants,
      I'm pretty sure I saw it at some ancient charts. (here eeds to be

      could be the actual initial-middle-final of some 21-letter set of

      Here, somebody sent this image my way:<br>
      <img src="V_files/1587062913488.jpg" alt="" width="720"
        height="1280"><br>
      with this text: <font size="+1">The Phoenician word for the
        planet Saturn is "Yesreile" (Israel).<br>
        The Phoenicians were the original Israelites, "those who follow
        Saturn".<br>
        Many different sects of the Phoenicians spread out through
        Eurasia, becoming the Scythians, Celts, Germanic, etc... people.<br>
        They eventually settled Ireland, making it the last place where
        the ancient Aryans resided. Rome and Britian would eventually
        purge this land of thos people, but not before they could sail
        the globe spreading their religion of Sun worship. Hence the
        many Sun Pyramids and worship sites scattered throughout the
        world. They were the ancient builder race. Hence the Red haired
        Mummies and Swaztikas found at practically every ancient
        civilization.<br>
        Rome could not contain the spread of their religion and
        eventually appropriated and made it their own.<br>
      </font>So I used some text from that image to find the source,
      it's The affinity between the hebrew language and the celtic:
      being a comparison between hebrew and the gaelic language, or the
      celtic of scotland. by Thomas Steatton<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      which is porbably just a coincidence, that I was just speaking of
      gaeilge (goidelic) and now I meet another similar term, gaelic. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      It's sorta wonderful I return here to add up the following and I
      find that I stopped at gaelic.<br>
      <br>
      I found a linguistic thr<a
        href="https://warosu.org/sci/thread/11561546"><font
          color="#000000">ea</font></a>d recently so I fpbp'ed it and
      few days later I made these outrageous claims you're probably
      aware of by now:<br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">&gt; Lots of old linguists thought Hebrew was the
        original language of the world before the tower of Babel<br>
        <br>
        Because bible told them so. We were literally taught the concept
        of "soul of the language" which was completely undefined, just
        some abstract something you are supposed to know what some dead
        professors thought about. Only in the 20th century. Karl Vossler
        identified soul of language as its accent. Why would I want to
        spend my time of my prime brain activity to memorizing all that
        crap? Probably so I have even less opportunity to challenge
        kikes teaching phoenician to be the first alphabet, even though
        it's not remotely true. <br>
        <br>
        &gt; based. what is the first alphabet then? <br>
        <br>
        Most probably Ogham.<br>
        I think phenotype was the same centuries down:<br>
        whites were inventing everything, while jews were scheming as
        usual. </font><br>
      <br>
      The thread is active at this point, but I'm prepared the trumps of
      a &amp; o being the same in runes and carbon analysis being a
      nothingburger. We'll se how it goes from here.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      and why I decided to pring it here is because at the same time my
      eye fell at the Gaeilge alphabet from vol1:<br>
      <img src="img/230.png" alt="" width="417" height="288"><br>
      and I noticed that it's even more based than italian. And looking
      further I noticed that it would be perfect rhombus with vowel U if
      we unify P &amp; R(Р) or S &amp; T <font color="#cccccc">(this
        line that used to be the most based is now challenged, okay,
        we'll see where it will lead us too)</font> and then it will be
      an alphabet of 17 letters. But now it's of 18, just as runic
      alphabet from Bornholm. Only ᚴ is transfered from the third line
      to the first. and if it's true, then the fourth line must be the
      same ᚮᚱᛣᛋᛏᚢ and just as I supposed before ᚱ is П and ᛣ is R. And
      ᛋᛏ are out of question, so I suppose it was like this:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="V_files/hypothetic_gaeilge.png" alt="" width="417"
        height="288">where R is just swashed form of P, just as K is of
      ᚴ<font color="#cccccc">(Г)</font><br>
      <br>
      and the thread oes on: <br>
      <font size="+1">&gt; What makes you think that?<br>
        In few words: decades of digging in that field.<br>
        Let me give you a more extended argument from the top of my
        head:<br>
        a) the most primitive forms<br>
        b) parallels with the second most primitive in graphics: ᚐ is to
        ᚑ just as ᛆ is to ᚮ just as a is to aa (aa is o in Denmark)<br>
        the third most primitive is whether paleohispanic syllabaries or
        tifinagh (picrelated) where a is also one dot and two dots are
        labial vowel, and I can go for hours about it.<br>
        c) radiocarbon dating being one of the biggest nothingburgers I
        know of: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Present</font><br>
      <img src="V_files/Tifinagh_abjad.png" alt="" width="441"
        height="1025"><br>
      and that picrelated made me think that just as N of ogham was
      replaced from the third position to the fifth, so could ᚒ stand
      for ᚔ? could ⵗ be tifinagh's original i reduced by berberic
      pronounciation to j and further into k's of all forms (just as k
      is between I &amp; l as it's in the same claster, hinting that i
      is originally hiccup)<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">and that makes ogham originally a
        three-vowel system and for the first time can I give the
        historic spread in the first approach: from ogham to runes and
        paleo-hispanic, from runes to etruria, from spain to berbers,
        from berbers to meroe, from meroe to egypt, and to ethiopia,
        from ethiopia to sinai, from there further to the east: egyptian
        hieroglyphs to chinese hieroglyphs and alphabetic systems to
        india. but you know it's probably dead wrong, so let's put it in
        some noble gray. More likely both Egypt and China were
        influenced by completely different writing systems: around Vinca
        (vicca?) excuse my wild gussing, but I wouldn't get this far if
        I didin't allwo all of them to go all the ways - which was
        probably related to linearA and it could predate more abstact
        alphabetic system.</font><br>

      words are not necessary. Easier for mof earworm when the song

      vesyolkin+pivovarova and changed to kolpak garkushi and a good way
      to recall memory is by words. Words in songs are only to remember

      I was only speaking negatively about artificial languages before,
      but here's a really good one, with enormous scientific value: <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona"><img

          width="192" height="1117"></a><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      They managed to create usable language in only this many words.<br>
      It's somewhat about how many smaller signs chinese hieroglypics
      consists of, btw.<br>
      Could it be some unaccepted scientific therory unifying mayan with
      others presented as invention insted? There's only one way to find
      out. Great introduction into mayan, btw.<br>
      <br>
      here, they also have syllabary:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="V_files/toki_pona_syllabary.png" alt="" width="817"
        height="1213"><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      About 120 words are all their dictionary. Which corresponds basic
      elements of chinese hieroglyphics, but this language is believed
      to have only good words (but I see hunt, it's alasa)<br>
      And they have only 19 verbs or so.<br>
      I don't know if this language counts, but I will learn it just to
      brag knowing one artificial language.<br>
      <br>
      But let's pray it's not gonna fuck with my understanding of
      natural languages. Pray ~ pay <br>
      (pay attention in this case, usually prayers pay with prayers,
      with praise, prey ~ beg, pay ~ bag? buck?)<br>

      &gt; Mathe Mythe Muse<br>
      Math is from mother (because kitchen works with proportions, and
      generally numbers)<br>
      Music could be a cognate with мужик muzhik, myж, marida, someone
      mother's. Girls love musicians, so most musicians are males. Most
      of artists are males, maybe because muses were rationalized as
      females, which contradiction could be caused by females inventing
      arts when males were hunting. Io and Seshat both invented writing
      systems, both are women. So when <br>
      Myth stands for The My, of Me. both The and of could be θ so if it
      i about family, M is probably our, own, my and A U I are three
      forms of gender suffixes: female, male, neutral. Mother Father

      and child was of female gender (women invented writing systems, so
      I believe as today mostly gals go for language science
      departments, it was always the case (gals make great poets, and
      many male poets are gay, the king of them all taught that a poet
      has to become everything, many priests were castrated probably for
      similar reasons)<font color="#cccccc"> it was self-censored from

        <font size="+1">&gt;Thd critical period part basically says that
          languages use rules that can never be learned from using the

          talk. But that seems to me to be the opposite of what you
          said: If it was hardwired, why would he miss it. It seems like
          neuroplasticity wrote onto those parts we use for speech with
          something else.</font></font><br>
      <font color="#cccccc"><font color="#cccccc">Isn't it the opposite
          of what chomskians teach? Was it necessary for their lies to
          be that gross and explicit that people who would want to
          oppose would be confused by all the swamp singing bravo to
          that obvious absurd (as they probably did many times before)
          so that any opposition would be demoralized and averted for
          some other field? Because linguistics is too deep into
          politics (no wonder translators are allowed into the highest
          corridors, of which they're enormously proud.) imaging dating
          holy books not when they were supposed to originate or god
          forbid reinterpreting them. Imaging creating your own tribe
          with some new dialect and demands of independance. Imagine
          discovering previous mythology in the bodies of natural
          languages. Imagine understanding all the nlp-tier magic tricks
          priests and wizards of the past wove into the structure of our
          everyday life. Which reminds me of one interesting lecture, of

      looking guy, speaking sometimes outrageously baseless things,
      mixed with some probably authentic information:
      http://esotericawakening.com/elder-futhark-the-secrets-of-the-runes<br>
      so I responded, but wakaba swallowed few symbols, such as <font
        size="+1">♓︎</font><br>
      <font size="+1">&gt;&gt;11606523<br>
        Now that is definitely some pseudoscience, but it's not exactly
        linguistics (which is also not science enough yet or anymore)<br>
        connection of the sacred berberic letter ⵣ to ♓︎ is interesting,
        but vague. You should better compare it to ᛯ (these are
        different symbols. if all you can see is some rectangles,
        install universalia or some other font-pack) which could be a
        bind rune of ᛘ(or ᛉ) with ᛣ, or it could be ᚼ(or ᛡ) which is
        probably related to russian Ж, mostly because ⵣ is told to sound
        like z (while Ж is zh) yet there's another sign: ⵥ (which is
        further from Ж graphically, but closer to it phonetically) and
        all this beauty could be just a schematic depiction of the Sun,
        also because Ж pretty much stands for G, which is literally
        called sol in musical notation, which is told to be relatively
        recent invention, but I seriously doubt it was inveted from
        scratch: mucial notation by letters was known even to ancient
        greeks.<br>
        ᚼ(or ᛡ) could be related to ж not only because it stands at the
        similar position in the alphabet, but also because j can sound
        as both ʒ and h, roughly speaking. which makes that rune,
        together with H which turned into russian И [i] an allomorph of
        I (a double form of it or something) which could go further back
        to 𓇋 and 𓇌(𓏭) <br>
        I also watched the video in the middle of that page you sent
        (after the main part and before Related Posts and Comments) and
        I have no idea why he tells that perfect system is 26 (when
        numeral system takes 27) and that some full ammount of letters
        "for original root language of the universe" (oh may goat woah)
        is 29 - no idea where he took it, probably from some
        "revelation" (direct source, lol)<br>
        Also the runic chart he uses in to original, but some pulling in
        upon english alphabet (you can see it among other things by rune
        ᚲ repeating three times (c k q) <br>
        He could be right that (he quotes here someone else) english
        language being somewhat authentic (after all it's name is close
        to angelic (engels is both english and angels in Dutch, actually
        I'm lying, they have another suffix for plural form, and angels
        is engelen) but it's one of the less based elements of my
        theory, yet one of the most based parts of his rant.<br>
        Then he tells that etymology is the universal language, which is
        very smart. He also seems to be a sincere guy, so I could be the
        missing links between academic science and the freaks like him,
        who actually also collect enormous ammount of obscure
        information on this little-studied subject, they only lack some
        self-irony and healthy scepticism to distinguish righteous
        knowledge from ridiculous fabrications (but who of us is not
        guilty, we all want it all and right now)<br>
        He also pronounces etymology as if it's from atom, very
        interesting interpretation. It's at least poetic, or maybe even
        accurate, I cannot tell for sure yet.<br>
        8 minutes deeper into his lecture, and I got irritated by his
        not exactly scientific approach, but when he mentions that
        rune=ram it made me go hm... because golden fleece is zlato
        runo, which could explain argonauts' trip full of dangers for
        some fur with golden pieces, it didn't make much sense, but if
        it was some furry parchment, it makes perfect sense: it was on a
        tree, protected by some mighty snake, which correlated norse
        mythology of tree of life where probably Odin hanged for three
        days when he conceived them. Also the trip took place after
        LinearB was lost and Alphabet wasn't acquired yet (and this
        interpretation btfo the phoenician origin) <br>
        And when he began saying lamb is the light because lamb is the
        lamp - I got overirritated and stopped at around 10:00 so I will
        maybe return to his babble later. don't disconnect.<br>
      </font><br>
      so I keep watching that video of 1:49:55 I didn't manage to
      download with a pencil in my hand:<br>
      <br>
      He speaks of aries, probably connecting it to aryans (because
      their heads are curly? I told you every national name could be
      slur) and that sign is also interesting, because it looks like
      вилочковый крест: ♈︎ (which reminds me of that terracota crucifix
      looking like a pagan bull or goat scull)<br>

      <br>
      now I turn that video on, from minute 10, because those who wove
      that narrative probably did it not by scientific method but by
      some magical babble of that very level <font color="#cccccc">(is
        bible babble?)<br>
      </font>but I turn it back off, because that is some apophenic
      study which could have some good seeds, but more likely will just
      fuck my lucidity up.<br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">pt3 <font color="#cccccc">(to that video from
          newagers' link above </font></font><font size="+1"><font

        10:00 and on:<br>
        &gt; qrstu christu, because this is christian science<br>
        which makes it no more science than some islamic science<br>
        &gt; lmn, not lemon, lumen (light)<br>
        &gt; abca defgi, abracadabra, to create with opening words<br>
        &gt; diplomacy mad policy, moon-light thin gloom (embedded with
        the moon light, this is the power of english language), it's a

        &gt; that's just to show you the power of lexigrams<br>
        I'm sorry kid, I'm not impressed.<br>
        And I don't know if I'm going to look into his rant further, but
        I'm definitely not going to post it here, because that level of
        apophenic studies belong to /x/ or who knows where else.</font><br>
      <br>
      I think I have to watch it all, because that esoterist seems to be
      convinced in what he's saying, thus there can be something
      valuable, which made him accept the rest of theat theory, with all
      its weaker parts which annoy me with that wickedness. <br>

      all those new age gals who thing he's just gorgeous, and that's

      Muslims ae even further on this scale, and they are worse than

      Why are they angry? Because they're further on the scale, they're
      angry they chose the wrong team. Atheists team seem to be winning,
      and hindus probably taught tham that blind faith can lead them to
      success. <br>

      I should avoid falling into mere wordplay. But wordplays brought

      that's not how it works, sly is the opposite of wise.<br>

      And I bumped that thead with lol op is right whether because I was

      Wat is my strategy? I'm affraid I have none. I go wherever my view
      express. I focus it, but I have to know what I focus it on.<br>
      I want universal morphemes, so start building the database. I need
      ai for it.<br>
      I have to calculate when I can afford the ai of those features.<br>
      I have to ask a program to collect all shor words of same meanings
      from different languages, then to find the average pronounciation,
      and then to compare it to all the examples.<br>
      There will be different strategies and I have to choose which
      algorhythm delivers the best results. They will all probably have
      interesting coincidences, And if I can use few algorhythms to

        the next comment confused me because I wasn't sure what it was

        program of unifying all the languages.<br>
      </font><br>
      <br>
      this is what I wanted to add to that thread and it's why it was
      bumped by me, because I didn't close the subject:<br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">&gt;&gt;11605335<br>
        How can one scientifically determine if Evropa is jewish
        princess which conquered the continent across the sea on the
        back of some bull (baal?) or if evri are jews who pretended to
        be europeans (a german girl told me that germans dislike jews
        for stealing their german names) - I think this one of many
        manes of jewish nation is not known in english? hebrews is the
        closest cognate? he could be their "the" (ה) and brews could be
        their professional name for brewing or for belief (vera is faith
        in russian) or for liar and thief (vri is lie, vrun is liar, vor
        is thief) and another russian word jid (geed) is a cognate of
        your jew and german jude and the same jid as in polish, and it's
        recognized as greedy (and also liquid: jidok &amp; jidok are
        different only in which vowel is stressed)<br>
        Now you understand why true linguistics is impossible by
        political reasons? Every nation name is a slur, and it crushes
        all their patriotism wider than your own inherited property. And
        it undermines basis of the tax collecting. But world is really
        changing, for many reasons, and for good. We only have to change
        too. I haven't told you about russians yet, to balance that
        rant:<br>
        R in russian Rus is made with tongue, which makes it sorta tRus,
        and that is a russian word for coward. their family names often
        end with ow and owa (and sometimes kow and kowa, and sometimes
        sow and sowa, cowers and sowers? because Rus is village in
        Latin, coyboys ans soyboys? too used to cows who allow to be cut
        peacefully, not a warrior) russian boys are dressed as hares for
        new year events, another word rusak stands for both russian and
        a hare. <br>
        And on the top of that all, most of nation names correspond with
        personal names (so to call them christian names is not always
        correct, most of them are not related to christians: Dmitry is
        of ancient goddess Demetra) so Slavik is the basis for many
        common russian names: Vyacheslav, Vladislavj.<br>
        also Ruslan's, Dan's, German's, Frantz's, (have deeper meanings
        too) <br>
        <br>
        but the thread died on a perfect accord of linguistics being
        mostly a pseudoscience. I think that was what I wanted? or what
        I needed, for real. If I don't like the department I am supposed
        to be a part of, I have to expose them as impostors. I will
        build this field anew. I do. I reallly do.</font><br>

      If this diagram is correct (The Three Mother Letters' part is
      about or just right)<br>
      Then these three mothers should come through the other groups.<br>
      ב and פ are definitely of מ <br>
      כ looks so similar to ב which could be related to c connected to b
      so much.<br>
      but כ is more probably of ש group, then we have gropus of 1 2 and
      4 letters with ר being the only one somehow related to א (in
      srbsko-hrvatski and sanskrit R is considered vowel)<br>
      The third group has vowel ה י ע, (maybe ל is of that vowel group
      too (because it is in sanskrit and ר) <br>
      The third group has only one explicit vowel: ו (but maybe נ ט and
      ס are of that group too)<br>
      If what is in the brackets is true, then <br>
      the third group has only four left for linguals: ז ח צ ק<br>

      living cell, I inevitably come to chicken egg, and that it could
      be possible to dissolve the yolk into chromosomes by its
      coagulation maybe?<br>
      And it leads me to thinking of solve/coagula and it becomes too
      opposite chemical processes of solution and coagulation
      (растворить и свернуть)<br>

      <br>

      I think of how I should be the first row. because of the form of

      And I think that if E is three, then what would be the succession?
      There's no letter between I and E.<br>
      What if A is not 4our, but 3 for a, △<br>
      Then E is between I &amp; A, and thus 2 e as an open form of в? Е
      can be open form of B too.<br>
      and I drow cursive e in my mind, and I see it looks like some

      ע as э is fascinating.<font color="#999999"> א as o is confusing,

        color="#cccccc">(у is u in russian, and it all ring the bell on

        vowels look the same in form of u (which is и (i) in russian
        cursive))</font><br>
      the name of letter is вов (vov) <font color="#cccccc">which is
        actually a strong meme for soviet jews: it's acronim of великая

      pronounce tet as e.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      That א as o is my misreading, it's explained at previous page (I
      made the image clickable) it's a by default and only when the
      combination of vertical and horizontal lines colour it o, as if
      those lines were au, because wh were taught at hebrew school that
      just horizontal line is a, and that the t mark is also a, but now
      it seems it's o (at least in yiddish, why would hebrew dare to
      change it? some moscovite akanye maybe) so horizontal line is a,
      and vertical is vav.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      so if vertical and horizontal line are otherwise counterpositioned
      A &amp; V,&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;which is the same story of D &amp; B, <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then the third mother is expected to be I &amp;

      Which returns us to the three mothers in the form of three birds:

      of bear less than you <br>
      <br>
      It went all the ways, but I didn't feel like talking about it
      right now: I'm high and social interactions even in the internet
      are harmful for the high.<br>
      <br>
      let's go all the ways instead:<br>
      we're affraid of bear less than you in two meanings: we're affraid
      of you more, you're afraid more.<br>
      <br>
      so is it a coincidence or a psy-p?<br>

      is it a c or p-0p?<br>

      if it's natural, russians associated themselves with hares, and
      thus they ran from cities to hide from wars. until the mongols
      came, duh? russians were not nomad, thus they lived in cities
      before they went to rus, to лес. роща is the word.<br>
      forrest = for rest? рости в лесу? лес растения <br>

      o is more regular line than u-line<br>

      e is a form of i, because both lines replace labials (e only does

      Г F Б В? it's ᛒᚦᚠᚴ in runes of Bornholm (I should just say runes
      by now, but I'm so modest, so I think of someone who just had this
      piece quoted somewhere, but then a<font color="#cccccc">g</font>ain

      there are anglo-saxon runes, that are different, there are runes
      of different periods, both old and young futhark have different
      number of runes from that Bornholm runes (the only going in
      alphabetic order I know of, they're the number of armanen runes
      and I would treat them less serious if I didn't know that they
      follow the structure and support other structures I discovered
      before: B D was followed in the second raw (never seen before, but
      some old greek I heard of but never saw, will google now, it's
      said to be EF.. no, wasn't ABГ they have. but in latin it's EFG,

      It would seem that runic preserved this system better, because
      both&nbsp; F &amp; Г:&nbsp; ᚠ &amp; ᚴ <br>
      but they don't have E, they have some ᚾ <br>
      which tells that runes don't go three lines if ᛋ is one and ᚱ is
      two.<br>
      either way, only two or one places of contact to the staff. I
      think ᛋ is st<font color="#cccccc">e</font>aveless ᚱ <br>
      or that they were mirroring eachother at first as S &amp; Z (R is
      Zh in chinese and some other)<br>

      <font face="MathJax_Caligraphic">Z</font> is crossed in other
      fonts (here I choose some I hope you can see) with the middle

      Initial-middle-final? RST UVW XYZ seems right. LMV OPQ<br>
      it's awesome! IJK? or HIJ? ABCD EFGH thus IJK but what if it was
      ABC, ABC it is! DEF is deaf? I don't know what follows, I want to
      have a bath, and I don't have warm water. ABC DEFGHIJK until I
      know LMN as the triad. HIJK is the three: HYK, as XYZ? k~R<font
        color="#999999">~Z</font><font color="#cccccc">~T</font> and H ~
      Х! it is awesome!<br>
      EFG is that very EFГ we were just talking in this very session.<br>
      Thus ABCD is ABC as is the name, just as it is in ᛆᛒᚦ and I think
      etruscan AC [AB] makes sense if it was the even more primal form
      of ABCD.<br>
      Thus there were not 26, but 24 letters in the alphabet? 8 triads?
      with 27th letter it could be 9 triads which would also divide into
      3 nines. which allows to use it as numeral system (cycle of 27
      goes to 999, and thousands go with strokes or other marks)<br>

      trinity? Where could it be?<br>
      ABD EFГ HIJK LMN OPQ RST UVW XYZ<br>
      and I see that R is of OP QR. STV? this way it would be not 8 but
      7 trinities, this is closer to my noon noone known to my
      knowledge, my noosphere if I dare. 3 and 7 are some universally
      recognized holy numbers (I don't really know why, but I think I
      found one of reasons why it could be. if the alphabet is of 7
      trinities: 3 &amp; 4our? ABD EFГ HIJK<br>
      LMN yea! it's literally known as the beginning of the second half
      of the alphabet.<br>
      LMN OPC? OПР СТУ<br>
      OPS repeats ABC better, but we have ABD.. <font color="#cccccc">Ꙙ</font>ѦBD?

      321? d as in odin, a din? or add un?<br>
      ОПР reflect ABD better, even though it doesn't have to. Or does
      it? do others do? <br>
      is ᚾ four? and it is fourth. and I thought of Ꚛ without circle, +<br>
      while ᚠ is only two right segments, ᚴ is the upper right fourth,
      thus 1? <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">Га-плоид отсюда? я вообще не уверен что га-
        stands for one.</font><br>
      I didn't expect ᚾ also look like 4 when it's closer to Ч, <font

      <br>
      So ABD is 321, EFG is 421 HIJK? I don't knoe not only if that
      theory is correct but also if it is universal through all the
      triades, but I surely will see.<br>

      O P R? О П Р? is P half of O or is it fourth? O Р С is the trinity
      of moons. But why is such an order?<br>
      The same reason other numbers don't go srtaight, not to turn
      alphabet into calendar. I isn't a calendar, that's the idea. So di
      alphabet evolve from calendar? Is it 28 moon days one not playing
      in numeral systerms? then it's 2.5 not playing, because google
      tells that moon is 29d8h to 29d18h<br>
      are they jokers? because other 28 can be divided into four by
      7AKQP1098? or AKQP123? isn't A 1?<br>
      K 2 again? Q 3? P 4? 5 6 7? на златом крыльце сидели царь царевич
      король королевич сапожник портной кто ты будешь такой?<br>
      There are 5 of them. And that moon's OPC ends it without T or V.
      TVX though another way to end it. I think, I read, I never met it
      myself yet. <br>

      here, I sent him the message:<br>
      <div class="u-tcGrayDarkest u-lineHeight1_6">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        &gt; lingual D, the palatal I, the guttural A, labial U, and the
        dental S.
        <br>
        Lingua is the tongue. Palate and dents are where that tongue is
        pressed, which is rather inconsistent. What structure will you
        see if you unite D I(and e) S and other in the group of lingual?
        And U(and o) among labial, but also aeiou are vowels at the same
        time (there are lingual and labial consonants, so there're
        lingual and labial vowels, and A is being none, as maybe H in
        english unless it depends on the back of the tonge for K does) I
        understand why you call A guttural: so semitic alphabets dogmas
        don't conflict your theory and I can be of some other group. Gut
        could be the cognate of God (when a man is poisoned, he often
        can only pray (and praise?) gut to overcome that poison) also
        good is gut in german and snake is гад [gad] in russian. It also
        relates to wisdom in symbology and wisdom is a godly attribute,
        while madness is demonic: бес [bes] is demon in russian, besheny
        and bezumny is mad and crazy. It all also relates to snake being
        related to both Lucifer and Jesus who are very similar figures,
        but I probably shouldn't go into this fusion beyond linguistics
        because it can upset some people.</div>
