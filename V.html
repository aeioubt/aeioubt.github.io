      That fourth volume ends as if would end if I died in the end, one
      thought in front of the other. <br>

        of letters having one(?) to five(?) semantic meanings it can
        take in different words, dare I say, correct? That was a good
        classification of language by semantics, it was an awesome work
        I read in the 90s I think, though I put it away when he began
        building his lexics, because I wanted to make it myself,
        independently, so I could compare my findings to his dictionary.

      With these two raw aſf but neverthe less dictionaries to what
      kessler theorized and thus to Kessler<a
        href="mirrors/Ya_A_Kesler_Azbuka_i_russko-evropeyskiy_slovar.pdf"><font
          color="#000000">'</font></a>s:.<br>
      but no, let some ai (artificial or augmented intelligence) does it
      afterwards, because I tried to find алый in his Ъ groups, and I
      couldn't find it. I would place it whether in Ъ6 next to fire
      (look at the very end of the book to see his rationalization of
      fire being with Я) or to Ъ18 next to ярый (яркий, эти группы
      связаны и не понятно умышленно или случайно, и не известно что
      страшней, ууууу)<br>
      <br>
      so I put a mirror to his book at that previous ' in case the link
      in the one before it dies, because it's an outstanding work,
      whether it is correct or not, and it would be a bummer if it's
      lost, because it could be the biggest loss in that Fomenko
      scandal, when some historic works were made by mathematician and
      published in the most prominent soviet university and later
      historic department labelled them as pseudoscientific (look who's
      talking!) but failing to attach any constructive criticism to his
      work for at least three years (I was watching that situation
      closely) maybe even five (so long ago it was, that my memory is
      not sure about this digit in it) and only after let's say 3 to 5
      years an engineer or a mathematician (memory also doubts what
      version is true) began public intellectual battle with Fomenko,
      and I wasn't able to follow their conversation, because whether
      their argumentations required some level of competence I didn't
      feel like achieving educating myself, or just the interest to this
      situation faded with time, because what the situation taught me is
      that fuck academia, those clerks don't know shit, so I was
      liberated to begin my work from scratch without leaning onto the
      academia speers. And the same rationalization could be beyond
      Kessler's attempt to group all the dictionary into lesser semantic
      groups without bringing reconstructed forms and structures made
      before them (they can always be wrong, and me personally, I don't
      believe in established language families, because of how russian
      and japanese are similar. If I want to preserve the family
      structure which is wide accepted today, I should attach japanese
      to slavic languages, but it would be so insane and actually why
      not to combine chinese to english because of some similarities? wo
      &amp; we and short words and simple grammar, that probably were
      the two huge branches we initially were on, but cross-culture
      communications made russian drift further from japanese and closer
      to english, just as japanese drifted towards chinese, so it's not
      a tree, but a jar or aminoacids the way I imagine it.<br>
      But after saying all that I decide to not dig into his theory
      until I develop my own dictionary and let it be better than his,
      with much less semantic clasters.<br>
      I dare to mention Fomenko more and more explicitly in these texts
      probably because I grew more hostile towards academia, but also
      because a friend of mine mentioned him as a freak not worth
      mentioning and I asked him why exactly doesn't he like what he
      said, and I couldn't receive a coherent answer to that, he simply
      accepted that academia is always right. Even though history of
      science here and again prove otherwise.<br>
      So about the freaks, we should distinguish between them: there are
      obvious freaks like Chudinov who's probably there to smear some
      authentic artifacts like that Bornholm alphabet runestone; then
      there are those freaks who are whether fools or trolls like
      Oreshkin; then there are some clinically insane freaks like
      Lukashevich. Those evaluations are purely subjective, but they
      allow to understand where I stand.<br>
      The other group of linguistic freaks are Vashkevich and Dragunkin,
      who pull some outrageous conclusions out of their observations,
      but the observations itself may be rather useful for those who
      learn foreign languages (Vashkevich compare arabic words to greek,
      russian and whatever else, I didn't even read him. Dragunkin
      compares russian to japanese and to english. All that can be
      incredibly useful as mnemonic tools) <br>
      Fomenko also belongs to that second group of semi-correct
      scientific marginals, and the most prominent reason of his
      theories not being taken serious (I'm not even talking of them
      being accepted) is that he doesn't have historian education. But
      seriously, if prominent mathematicians use some previously
      published tools and models to the structure of historic data, that
      alone demands a proper outlook from scientific society, which
      didn't happen when he was relatively alright, and now there's even
      less chance of that being done properly, for that guy whether went
      trolling or was sold out or whatver happened to him, that the
      level of his scientific thought dropped from mathematical
      modelling to mere speculations. Or it could be because it's easier
      to notice what is wrong with the state of affair happening at the
      moment, but one has ever-growing tendency to fall short when (s)he
      tries to describe as it was or what's supposed to be done in the
      future. Me myself, I'm definitely in that second group of freaks,
      and some of my assumptions are probably dead wrong, but those main
      elements of this theory the structures and some other findings may
      persist and sustain. And I actually except some academic
      recognition in the following three years or so. Even though I was
      recently told that <font size="+1">Ignaz Semmelweis was
        disregarded for awhile because MDs are psychopaths: see
        Semmelweis effect. Gregor Mendel's founding of genetics was
        completely ignored for thirty something years </font>I began
      that path believing that anything can be achieved in mere ten
      years, also they say history goes faster than before, so I expect
      it to take society ten years to recognize what it's all about. And
      it's been over six years now since I went public, so..<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      An awesome stuff waves of the internets bring my way<br>
      <a href="https://warosu.org/sci/thread/11295132"><img

      <br>
      Yeah, no use to reform the academia, leave it completely, create
      your own castle on clearer spot and firmer ground.<br>
      My next task on this way is to create some information resource,
      where all ALL the information on the planet weraltdh is united
      into a net of references, which would show russian literary
      publications and global academic science, and maybe some
      paraacademic figures like Heaviside will be in its orbits.<br>
      <br>
      I will be in freaky nebulas, because I refered to people standart
      academia doesn't dare to mention. I will be their weak bond to
      some obscure linguistics of more academic figures, with all the
      respect academic, my punk rock is justified, but as I said in the
      very beginning, some of them are alright, some of them are very
      alright, but i don't know any very alright individual in
      linguistics, even myself is too weird to be a king, and above
      whom? fuck them, gosh. But they milk go-t, but insane militaries
      milk the goat much better, it doesn' make me want' to participate
      in their deeds. But what if we make military actions agains us
      ineffective? they are not interested, because they want to reserve
      the possibility to successfully bomb their own population if they
      must, for themselves. or am I just way too cynical?<br>
      <br>
      I think it's time to draw a draft of that structure, and I will
      probably make it in private, so I develop it first, but I gave you
      the idea, make your own attempt, or join my team.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      See how halaḥam follow the tradition I've seen first in Arabic
      vowel diacritics:<br>
      unlike philippines writing system make it, here u gets a high
      mark, and i gets a low mark, which would be more natural for me as
      a child (elephant is high, so why his sound is low? and mouse is
      visa versa)<br>
      <img src="img/140.png" alt="" width="378" height="444"><br>
      <img src="img/141.png" alt="" width="378" height="404"><br>
      But here we see why it could be: in philippines the order is AIU,
      and this one is the other order, and it makes these writing
      systems related to ogham of all things, which could be related to
      some berber ancients. The following research is needed, and it's
      time to add english version of colored ge'ez to vol.1.<br>
      <br>
      But I only added the text version, maybe some day will remake it
      into english:<br>

      This time I also noticed what I misse the first time (other than
      хы хо во in ge'ez part) the other b-line, in the final row of ኀ:
      not only ጰ, but also some ፐ which is out of the structure, and yet
      to be archeologized in the archives of ethiopean philology.<br>
      <br>
      (that piece I copy-pasted from vol.1 where I just put it. well, at
      least for those who missed this edition, because he reads vol.2 or
      3 when I update vol.1<br>
      And more than that to speak more about it not overcomplicating
      vol.1 with this autism:<br>
      <br>
      ሀ and በ oppose each other as a opposes б if you can see it. and we
      were talking of b reflecting d this way, but a &amp; d are
      probably historically the same letter, then e is c, o is ?, u is
      v=в=b, and we return to A reflecting V which is D reflecting B, I
      hope you follow this.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc"><br>
        And suddenly.. halaḥam, ogham (both has u's before i's)<br>
        ham is a rude person in russian (хам) <br>
        so does it make cultures that let i's (thin people, ladies(?))
        front more civilized? than those where big ones go first because
        it's better not to stand on their way: if they fall on you it
        may be a naughty knock-out. only guessing, hardly scientific is
        this guess, but hypotheses do belong scientific literature, I
        already said why, they can be proven or disproven by the reader.
        They also remind the reader, that some scientific information is
        not valid, even when it is displayed arrogantly certainly it can
        be false or wrong.</font><br>
      <br>
      I speak of someting important and on the same breath I speak of
      something hardly right or important, at least I can put it into
      grey. <font color="#cccccc">and it was here before I copypasted
        that vol.1 thing + its autism, so it's not on the same breath</font><br>
      <br>
      ሀ (a) turning into ሁ (u) in its diacritic form could be an attempt
      to notify u when it comes out of a and into u as it is bሀs, but
      abሁse. or it could be some other story, but actually I came here
      to say that in this ሀ both a &amp; u meet, it could be from those
      time when A &amp; U wasn't separated, but that sets an important
      question of how would people distinguish speech if so many now
      different things were the same.<br>

      The beginning of this volume will always want me to do something
      else, so embarrasing it is.<br>
      But I keep on digging, because sometimes some treasures appear.<br>
      <br>
      I also write in my notebooks (another portion of scans is coming
      in several months only, when the summer comes, I don't want to go
      there before that)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Russian orthography is made up by the germans (and etymology too)
      yet<br>
      if we write russian word for blue not the way they tell us, but
      the way we speak it, it's синии, сини is also that word (a short
      form of it) thus that reminds very much egyptian 𓏭 and 𓏼
      standing in egyptian grammar for a suffix of plural form.<br>
      <br>
      That made me think that what if russian has roots to those ancient
      languages of the past, and it doesn't mean aothers don't. And I
      know we all do, we relate them one way or another, and what if
      it's so fit we can write russian in it and read it rather easily
      because the things there sound like ours? What if egyptian
      hieroglyphs could be read in oter cultures by their scolars who
      could read it in their own language? I can test it right here,
      let's find how blue is in egyptian, and if it's near s, it is
      interesting.<br>
      <br>
      http://hieroglyphs.net doesn't know neither blue nor green, but it
      knows man, it's s, and it doesn't help.<br>
      and for whatever reason in reads king not how it's written,
      because it's literally satan:<br>

      while I was trying to find what I believe to be a berry, I found a
      weird sign I saw somewhere else:<br>
      𓊖 looks like one of phaestos disk's so whether the forger took
      this peculiar sign from egyptian, or that disk is authentic script
      not far from egyptian (then we have to compare these two, even
      though I posted someone showing how phaestos disk is a fraud, but
      I didn't read into that myself, so I can keep my intellectual
      freedom on this subject)<br>

      <br>
      once again about tolkien:<br>
      He's littered the pool of linguistic information with his invented
      writing systems.<br>
      The only writing system he took without much change (but to which
      he only made several weird additions) was nordic runes Nazi
      Germany was researching the most. And of course those runes were
      used by the bad guys (I'm speaking of Uruk Runes. Cyrth was much
      more different than the anglo saxon runes, and I don't know if
      calling some nation dwarves is actually flattering)<br>
      But when some Norwegian journalist noticed that, Tolkien cared
      enough to try to refute it with his response about him not having
      a slightest intention to have such parallels in mind, that he's
      apolitical and blablabla, that he's very offended by that
      interpretation of his work (as if it was much more than mere
      propaganda)<br>
      &gt; In the Foreword to the revised edition of The Lord of the
      Rings, Tolkien cautioned strongly against viewing it as an
      allegory, saying that he disliked allegory himself. Furthermore,
      according to his own claims, Tolkien denounced Hitler, Nazi
      beliefs, "race-doctrine" and apartheid and praised the Jews,
      calling them a "gifted people".<br>
      <br>
      Jews are gifted people alright, but even not speaking of the
      nature of that gift, that guy licks their asses for politically
      correct reasons, and he is successful, so maybe someone will learn
      from his example. But as for that work it would be a false note, I
      sympathize them and I dare I say it, fear them, even that, but
      that's another reason for me to be brave and honest, also because
      as Camus righteously said, nothing is more despicable than respect
      based on fear.<br>
      And though I lack that very portion of respect, I still offer some
      ambiadvantageous solutions, because it's the most rational thing
      to do in this situation. Hate the sin, not the sinner, remember?<br>
      People have little to no responsibility for whether genome they
      were born with or the culture they were plunged into. But both
      factors can be improved by genetic therapies and friendly
      counteractions.<br>
      Do you call such rants friendly? Yes, I do, honesty is friendly.
      Just as banters, they help us all evolve. Even when it hurts, its'
      medicinal, really.<br>
      <font color="#ffffff" size="-1"><br>
        Only now have I realized why does this work sound antisemitic
        (4снад screenshot was only natural) and that's the notion that
        semitic linguistic, the very centre of it, rots. Even though I <br>
        show that every other branch is not much better (I don't, I'm an
        antisemite, because many jews will not like that. Then let's not
        notice it. keep it in mind, but at least hide it from a plain
        sight, they will survive, help them) and I was brainwashed by
        some jew saying "antisemite as every great russian writer"
        Zionists support antisemitism. And they're white.
        overcompensate.<br>

      Back to that J is L hermesy, <br>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBjOs-egFMs"><font
          color="#000000">Here</font></a> a drunk mason claims that
      jewish god is Lucifer, and where I took I sent this response:<br>
      <blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3263153">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        Sombody didn't make his homework properly and got it all wrong.<br>
        Jesus and Lucifer is probably the same figure.<br>
        The jewish god though is the satan (as Book of Revelation
        righteously repeats at least twice)<br>
        In early christianity (aka gnosticism) Jesus was allegorically
        reprsented as a snake. And there are some ancient images, on
        coins for example with snake on a cross.<br>
        Masonry seems to be some gnostic school of whatever, though I'm
        not sure we really need this mumbo-jumbo for anything else other
        than to comprehend the rationale of those top-rank religious
        pricks. They'd rather have you not knowing the difference
        between good and evil, for being ignorant you would obey much
        easier and with less of uncomfortable quesions. <br>
        Also many satanists borrowed the Lucifer's image from his
        enemies, who are the Devils themselves (Mary'ed people, if I
        understand it right that Devil is suffixed form of Deva and Evil
        is of Eve, but of course it all seems pretty relativistic today,
        even though women and evil are on the same side in Tai Chi, but
        probably because when we're in love our hormones drive us dement
        (which could be a suffixed form of demon: mad is beshen in
        russian, bes is a demon) but that hormone disbalance's our
        problem, gals shouldn't be held responsible, that would be some
        catholic-tier satanism, and it makes the world uglier: a good
        excuse for ugly muslims who hate beauty, because Lucifer is told
        to be the prettiest of all the angels and the most beloved of
        that heavenly king who is a satan in palms of whom this world is
        until Esus comes back for good, but that reference make it all
        even more complicated, some ancient cults with their savage
        barbarian traditions, we should't be reconstructing those stages
        of our society, maybe only to look at it and laugh, because by
        laugh we get rid of the past)<br>
        Also both Jesus and Lucifer bear the title of Moring Star (the
        very last plot-twist of the new testament) and so on.</blockquote>

            It gets even more complicated when we notice that bothe
            Snake and Earth in russian are З-я (змея &amp; земля [zmeja
            &amp; zemlja]) and 3 looks like 3, and it's the third rock
            from sun (though here it could be some apophenia, but a
            funny one, but let's go the full circle: third sounds like
            seth, who was not only satan but also the third son of some
            biblical figure, so the trick of this rite is that we should
            realy take it easy because we're not capable of
            distinguishing gods from devils, because both are smarter
            than we're and can deceive us easily if they must) </span><span

      <font color="#999999">Informational singularity is probably here,
        according to how fast information travels. It was just yesterday
        when I found that I probably turned a good guy named
        proteineinsaider insane with my spheric capsule thing. Or maybe
        he just looks this way, because his poor drawing skills and with
        his being a lady maybe, otherwise why'd he use so much pink.
        That would explain it a lot. I also foud some AnyaLove000001 who
        is whether that proteineinsaider or a huge fan of his (her first
        posting is years after it appeared at 2ch, but it literally uses
        tag моё for something very similar to what (s)he posted at 2ch
        and later she uses proteineinsaider's work with title of С
        просторов интернета на тему вечной автономной капсулы, as if she
        knew about it because somebody in the comments told her about
        it, but I suppose it's for conspiracy (для конспирации, a
        disguise) but why I mention it here is that I should be careful
        with all this information, because it can lead people further
        out of balance. I wish that lady well. And I will probably
        contact her to use her in our documentary (a friend from tv is
        making a film with me and some other weird guys, and I openly
        highjack his project into a direction he will also like) so that
        lady who tells that Jesus is Lucifer published it probably a
        year ago (according to the comments) and she could also be
        influenced by me, so at this point I should be careful with
        references, not to bring some circular references. Either way,
        references never proved anything, no matter how important they
        become in contemporary academia (which is still a bunch of
        faggots, pun intended)</font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      And just before that J=L thing I saw that music vide<a

          color="#000000">o</font></a> (Kelli Ali's Hunter)<br>
      and here's the comment I'm not sure I should post or not (I will)<br>
      : seconds in and I've already realized that those skulls could be
      representing female figures (it became more obvious when I
      explored that rostral opening) and this hypothesis can be
      confirmed if some terracotta used to complete the sculpture, or
      refuted if such artifacts are never found. A decade ago I noticed
      that some terracotta crucifices look pretty much like bovine
      skulls and now this. <br>

      If this image demonstrates all the possible knots of it, I'd

      or three main syllables of B- G- D-<br>
      position Б is probably B<br>
      position А is probably A (because it's the simplest letter in

        too, but only it's </font>ugaritic<font color="#cccccc">, and
        this ugh cannot relate to those ogh and agh, because it stands

        with my research, because this shit is probably apophenic and

      Russian band Нуки can be transliterated as Noockie, if we want to
      make a magic four-letter name (кино, cure, abba) into
      seven-lettern name (madonna, michael jackson)<br>
      but it shows how it's similar to russians, which is rooskie in
      russian (c is always read as in cinema in russian, like s) rookie
      is новичок, новобранец, рекрут, n instead of r makes it
      new-russians, as if n is another r, Н another R, h ~ R, п looks
      exactly like n in cursive, п is p in lating, p is r in russian. We
      are noockie, but it looks like носки (socks) and many russian
      surnameds end на sky.<br>
      And ruckie is probably <br>
      <br>
      как может N быть Т это понятно, обе язычны, но как мог П оказаться
      в этой группе, Fart sound stands for No. N &amp; V meet in ν<br>
      see how many cases of lingual and labial having met!<br>
      also m is both M &amp; T, n is both N &amp; P (looks like since N
      and M are invariants, and one is lingual, the other is labial, all
      the letters after them are their whispering invariants: but why
      not T to M &amp; not P to N, but in reverse? if M and N are
      ivariants, then so is T &amp; П, 3 &amp; 2, both are пара, so what
      the difference.<br>
      I M N<br>
      O P T<br>
      seems right, the other half. the first one was (or is)<br>
      A B C<br>
      E F Г<br>
      dice are du? two dies? a pair of bones (one animal has exactly two
      of those bones used for divinations)<br>
      and initially it was not 6 digits per die, but only 4 (ctrlF vol.1
      for ашички)<br>
      <br>
      and because there were only 3 vowels... or could there be 4 vowels
      already when that divination appeared? then... one bone is left,
      the other right and... which is vowel which is consonant? or is it
      labial and lingual and vowels don't play here, they are for
      singing and from other culture or whatever.<br>
      Could common traits give birth to different notation languages?
      they shoure scould.<br>
      <br>
      Ruck is чернь (rookie is probably related, as fookie would be
      related to fuck) which correlates to rus standing for village in
      latin. kievan rus is kievskaya oblast, skaya is the female form of
      -sky, thus both suffixes are fimininized, thus is y (which is ya)
      I (me(? thus the shourt form of that adjective<br>
