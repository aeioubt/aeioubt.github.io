      <font color="#cccccc">it is all not always anything more than a

      That fourth volume ends as if would end if I died in the end, one
      thought in front of the other. <br>

        of letters having one(?) to five(?) semantic meanings it can
        take in different words, dare I say, correct? That was a good
        classification of language by semantics, it was an awesome work
        I read in the 90s I think, though I put it away when he began
        building his lexics, because I wanted to make it myself,
        independently, so I could compare my findings to his dictionary.

      With these two raw aſf but neverthe less dictionaries to what
      kessler theorized and thus to Kessler<a
        href="mirrors/Ya_A_Kesler_Azbuka_i_russko-evropeyskiy_slovar.pdf"><font
          color="#000000">'</font></a>s:.<br>
      but no, let some ai (artificial or augmented intelligence) does it
      afterwards, because I tried to find алый in his Ъ groups, and I
      couldn't find it. I would place it whether in Ъ6 next to fire
      (look at the very end of the book to see his rationalization of
      fire being with Я) or to Ъ18 next to ярый (яркий, эти группы
      связаны и не понятно умышленно или случайно, и не известно что
      страшней, ууууу)<br>
      <br>
      so I put a mirror to his book at that previous ' in case the link
      in the one before it dies, because it's an outstanding work,
      whether it is correct or not, and it would be a bummer if it's
      lost, because it could be the biggest loss in that Fomenko
      scandal, when some historic works were made by mathematician and
      published in the most prominent soviet university and later
      historic department labelled them as pseudoscientific (look who's
      talking!) but failing to attach any constructive criticism to his
      work for at least three years (I was watching that situation
      closely) maybe even five (so long ago it was, that my memory is
      not sure about this digit in it) and only after let's say 3 to 5
      years an engineer or a mathematician (memory also doubts what
      version is true) began public intellectual battle with Fomenko,
      and I wasn't able to follow their conversation, because whether
      their argumentations required some level of competence I didn't
      feel like achieving educating myself, or just the interest to this
      situation faded with time, because what the situation taught me is
      that fuck academia, those clerks don't know shit, so I was
      liberated to begin my work from scratch without leaning onto the
      academia speers. And the same rationalization could be beyond
      Kessler's attempt to group all the dictionary into lesser semantic
      groups without bringing reconstructed forms and structures made
      before them (they can always be wrong, and me personally, I don't
      believe in established language families, because of how russian
      and japanese are similar. If I want to preserve the family
      structure which is wide accepted today, I should attach japanese
      to slavic languages, but it would be so insane and actually why
      not to combine chinese to english because of some similarities? wo
      &amp; we and short words and simple grammar, that probably were
      the two huge branches we initially were on, but cross-culture
      communications made russian drift further from japanese and closer
      to english, just as japanese drifted towards chinese, so it's not
      a tree, but a jar or aminoacids the way I imagine it.<br>
      But after saying all that I decide to not dig into his theory
      until I develop my own dictionary and let it be better than his,
      with much less semantic clasters.<br>
      I dare to mention Fomenko more and more explicitly in these texts
      probably because I grew more hostile towards academia, but also
      because a friend of mine mentioned him as a freak not worth
      mentioning and I asked him why exactly doesn't he like what he
      said, and I couldn't receive a coherent answer to that, he simply
      accepted that academia is always right. Even though history of
      science here and again prove otherwise.<br>
      So about the freaks, we should distinguish between them: there are
      obvious freaks like Chudinov who's probably there to smear some
      authentic artifacts like that Bornholm alphabet runestone; then
      there are those freaks who are whether fools or trolls like
      Oreshkin; then there are some clinically insane freaks like
      Lukashevich. Those evaluations are purely subjective, but they
      allow to understand where I stand.<br>
      The other group of linguistic freaks are Vashkevich and Dragunkin,
      who pull some outrageous conclusions out of their observations,
      but the observations itself may be rather useful for those who
      learn foreign languages (Vashkevich compare arabic words to greek,
      russian and whatever else, I didn't even read him. Dragunkin
      compares russian to japanese and to english. All that can be
      incredibly useful as mnemonic tools) <br>
      Fomenko also belongs to that second group of semi-correct
      scientific marginals, and the most prominent reason of his
      theories not being taken serious (I'm not even talking of them
      being accepted) is that he doesn't have historian education. But
      seriously, if prominent mathematicians use some previously
      published tools and models to the structure of historic data, that
      alone demands a proper outlook from scientific society, which
      didn't happen when he was relatively alright, and now there's even
      less chance of that being done properly, for that guy whether went
      trolling or was sold out or whatver happened to him, that the
      level of his scientific thought dropped from mathematical
      modelling to mere speculations. Or it could be because it's easier
      to notice what is wrong with the state of affair happening at the
      moment, but one has ever-growing tendency to fall short when (s)he
      tries to describe as it was or what's supposed to be done in the
      future. Me myself, I'm definitely in that second group of freaks,
      and some of my assumptions are probably dead wrong, but those main
      elements of this theory the structures and some other findings may
      persist and sustain. And I actually except some academic
      recognition in the following three years or so. Even though I was
      recently told that <font size="+1">Ignaz Semmelweis was
        disregarded for awhile because MDs are psychopaths: see
        Semmelweis effect. Gregor Mendel's founding of genetics was
        completely ignored for thirty something years </font>I began
      that path believing that anything can be achieved in mere ten
      years, also they say history goes faster than before, so I expect
      it to take society ten years to recognize what it's all about. And
      it's been over six years now since I went public, so..<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      An awesome stuff waves of the internets bring my way<br>
      <a href="https://warosu.org/sci/thread/11295132"><img

      <br>
      Yeah, no use to reform the academia, leave it completely, create
      your own castle on clearer spot and firmer ground.<br>
      My next task on this way is to create some information resource,
      where all ALL the information on the planet weraltdh is united
      into a net of references, which would show russian literary
      publications and global academic science, and maybe some
      paraacademic figures like Heaviside will be in its orbits.<br>
      <br>
      I will be in freaky nebulas, because I refered to people standart
      academia doesn't dare to mention. I will be their weak bond to
      some obscure linguistics of more academic figures, with all the
      respect academic, my punk rock is justified, but as I said in the
      very beginning, some of them are alright, some of them are very
      alright, but i don't know any very alright individual in
      linguistics, even myself is too weird to be a king, and above
      whom? fuck them, gosh. But they milk go-t, but insane militaries
      milk the goat much better, it doesn' make me want' to participate
      in their deeds. But what if we make military actions agains us
      ineffective? they are not interested, because they want to reserve
      the possibility to successfully bomb their own population if they
      must, for themselves. or am I just way too cynical?<br>
      <br>
      I think it's time to draw a draft of that structure, and I will
      probably make it in private, so I develop it first, but I gave you
      the idea, make your own attempt, or join my team.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      See how halaḥam follow the tradition I've seen first in Arabic
      vowel diacritics:<br>
      unlike philippines writing system make it, here u gets a high
      mark, and i gets a low mark, which would be more natural for me as
      a child (elephant is high, so why his sound is low? and mouse is
      visa versa)<br>
      <img src="img/140.png" alt="" width="378" height="444"><br>
      <img src="img/141.png" alt="" width="378" height="404"><br>
      But here we see why it could be: in philippines the order is AIU,
      and this one is the other order, and it makes these writing
      systems related to ogham of all things, which could be related to
      some berber ancients. The following research is needed, and it's
      time to add english version of colored ge'ez to vol.1.<br>
      <br>
      But I only added the text version, maybe some day will remake it
      into english:<br>

      This time I also noticed what I misse the first time (other than
      хы хо во in ge'ez part) the other b-line, in the final row of ኀ:
      not only ጰ, but also some ፐ which is out of the structure, and yet
      to be archeologized in the archives of ethiopean philology.<br>
      <br>
      (that piece I copy-pasted from vol.1 where I just put it. well, at
      least for those who missed this edition, because he reads vol.2 or
      3 when I update vol.1<br>
      And more than that to speak more about it not overcomplicating
      vol.1 with this autism:<br>
      <br>
      ሀ and በ oppose each other as a opposes б if you can see it. and we
      were talking of b reflecting d this way, but a &amp; d are
      probably historically the same letter, then e is c, o is ?, u is
      v=в=b, and we return to A reflecting V which is D reflecting B, I
      hope you follow this.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc"><br>
        And suddenly.. halaḥam, ogham (both has u's before i's)<br>
        ham is a rude person in russian (хам) <br>
        so does it make cultures that let i's (thin people, ladies(?))
        front more civilized? than those where big ones go first because
        it's better not to stand on their way: if they fall on you it
        may be a naughty knock-out. only guessing, hardly scientific is
        this guess, but hypotheses do belong scientific literature, I
        already said why, they can be proven or disproven by the reader.
        They also remind the reader, that some scientific information is
        not valid, even when it is displayed arrogantly certainly it can
        be false or wrong.</font><br>
      <br>
      I speak of someting important and on the same breath I speak of
      something hardly right or important, at least I can put it into
      grey. <font color="#cccccc">and it was here before I copypasted
        that vol.1 thing + its autism, so it's not on the same breath</font><br>
      <br>
      ሀ (a) turning into ሁ (u) in its diacritic form could be an attempt
      to notify u when it comes out of a and into u as it is bሀs, but
      abሁse. or it could be some other story, but actually I came here
      to say that in this ሀ both a &amp; u meet, it could be from those
      time when A &amp; U wasn't separated, but that sets an important
      question of how would people distinguish speech if so many now
      different things were the same.<br>
      <br>

      I was looking for a languae where JK would stand for Jesus Christ,

      The beginning of this volume will always want me to do something
      else, so embarrasing it is.<br>
      But I keep on digging, because sometimes some treasures appear.<br>
      <br>
      I also write in my notebooks (another portion of scans is coming
      in several months only, when the summer comes, I don't want to go
      there before that)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Russian orthography is made up by the germans (and etymology too)
      yet<br>
      if we write russian word for blue not the way they tell us, but
      the way we speak it, it's синии, сини is also that word (a short
      form of it) thus that reminds very much egyptian 𓏭 and 𓏼
      standing in egyptian grammar for a suffix of plural form.<br>
      <br>
      That made me think that what if russian has roots to those ancient
      languages of the past, and it doesn't mean aothers don't. And I
      know we all do, we relate them one way or another, and what if
      it's so fit we can write russian in it and read it rather easily
      because the things there sound like ours? What if egyptian
      hieroglyphs could be read in oter cultures by their scolars who
      could read it in their own language? I can test it right here,
      let's find how blue is in egyptian, and if it's near s, it is
      interesting.<br>
      <br>
      http://hieroglyphs.net doesn't know neither blue nor green, but it
      knows man, it's s, and it doesn't help.<br>
      and for whatever reason in reads king not how it's written,
      because it's literally satan:<br>

      Dictionary of Middle Egyptian by Paul Dickson (2006) (Gardiner
      list) returns irtyw (𓇋𓂋𓄿.. and I don't know how to write what
      falllows (falls later, follows, it's som folk etymology alright, I
      am sorta poet, but I'm better than those) so I don't know why a of
      the 𓄿 became tiw, but if ir is some plant, than both ira and
      irtыв could be genetivus suffixes, but as I said I cannot write
      further, so I screenshot:<br>

      while I was trying to find what I believe to be a berry, I found a
      weird sign I saw somewhere else:<br>
      𓊖 looks like one of phaestos disk's so whether the forger took
      this peculiar sign from egyptian, or that disk is authentic script
      not far from egyptian (then we have to compare these two, even
      though I posted someone showing how phaestos disk is a fraud, but
      I didn't read into that myself, so I can keep my intellectual
      freedom on this subject)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I would say 𓂂 is that "berry", but it is told to be the pupil of
      the eye of Horus <font size="+1">or <a
