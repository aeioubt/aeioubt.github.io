        take in different words, dare I say, correct? That was a good
        classification of language by semantics, it was an awesome work
        I read in the 90s I think, though I put it away when he began
        building his lexics, because I wanted to make it myself,
        independently, so I could compare my findings to his dictionary.

      With these two raw aſf but neverthe less dictionaries to what
      kessler theorized and thus to Kessler<a
        href="mirrors/Ya_A_Kesler_Azbuka_i_russko-evropeyskiy_slovar.pdf"><font
          color="#000000">'</font></a>s:.<br>
      but no, let some ai (artificial or augmented intelligence) does it
      afterwards, because I tried to find алый in his Ъ groups, and I
      couldn't find it. I would place it whether in Ъ6 next to fire
      (look at the very end of the book to see his rationalization of
      fire being with Я) or to Ъ18 next to ярый (яркий, эти группы
      связаны и не понятно умышленно или случайно, и не известно что
      страшней, ууууу)<br>
      <br>
      so I put a mirror to his book at that previous ' in case the link
      in the one before it dies, because it's an outstanding work,
      whether it is correct or not, and it would be a bummer if it's
      lost, because it could be the biggest loss in that Fomenko
      scandal, when some historic works were made by mathematician and
      published in the most prominent soviet university and later
      historic department labelled them as pseudoscientific (look who's
      talking!) but failing to attach any constructive criticism to his
      work for at least three years (I was watching that situation
      closely) maybe even five (so long ago it was, that my memory is
      not sure about this digit in it) and only after let's say 3 to 5
      years an engineer or a mathematician (memory also doubts what
      version is true) began public intellectual battle with Fomenko,
      and I wasn't able to follow their conversation, because whether
      their argumentations required some level of competence I didn't
      feel like achieving educating myself, or just the interest to this
      situation faded with time, because what the situation taught me is
      that fuck academia, those clerks don't know shit, so I was
      liberated to begin my work from scratch without leaning onto the
      academia speers. And the same rationalization could be beyond
      Kessler's attempt to group all the dictionary into lesser semantic
      groups without bringing reconstructed forms and structures made
      before them (they can always be wrong, and me personally, I don't
      believe in established language families, because of how russian
      and japanese are similar. If I want to preserve the family
      structure which is wide accepted today, I should attach japanese
      to slavic languages, but it would be so insane and actually why
      not to combine chinese to english because of some similarities? wo
      &amp; we and short words and simple grammar, that probably were
      the two huge branches we initially were on, but cross-culture
      communications made russian drift further from japanese and closer
      to english, just as japanese drifted towards chinese, so it's not
      a tree, but a jar or aminoacids the way I imagine it.<br>
      But after saying all that I decide to not dig into his theory
      until I develop my own dictionary and let it be better than his,
      with much less semantic clasters.<br>
      I dare to mention Fomenko more and more explicitly in these texts
      probably because I grew more hostile towards academia, but also
      because a friend of mine mentioned him as a freak not worth
      mentioning and I asked him why exactly doesn't he like what he
      said, and I couldn't receive a coherent answer to that, he simply
      accepted that academia is always right. Even though history of
      science here and again prove otherwise.<br>
      So about the freaks, we should distinguish between them: there are
      obvious freaks like Chudinov who's probably there to smear some
      authentic artifacts like that Bornholm alphabet runestone; then
      there are those freaks who are whether fools or trolls like
      Oreshkin; then there are some clinically insane freaks like
      Lukashevich. Those evaluations are purely subjective, but they
      allow to understand where I stand.<br>
      The other group of linguistic freaks are Vashkevich and Dragunkin,
      who pull some outrageous conclusions out of their observations,
      but the observations itself may be rather useful for those who
      learn foreign languages (Vashkevich compare arabic words to greek,
      russian and whatever else, I didn't even read him. Dragunkin
      compares russian to japanese and to english. All that can be
      incredibly useful as mnemonic tools) <br>
      Fomenko also belongs to that second group of semi-correct
      scientific marginals, and the most prominent reason of his
      theories not being taken serious (I'm not even talking of them
      being accepted) is that he doesn't have historian education. But
      seriously, if prominent mathematicians use some previously
      published tools and models to the structure of historic data, that
      alone demands a proper outlook from scientific society, which
      didn't happen when he was relatively alright, and now there's even
      less chance of that being done properly, for that guy whether went
      trolling or was sold out or whatver happened to him, that the
      level of his scientific thought dropped from mathematical
      modelling to mere speculations. Or it could be because it's easier
      to notice what is wrong with the state of affair happening at the
      moment, but one has ever-growing tendency to fall short when (s)he
      tries to describe as it was or what's supposed to be done in the
      future. Me myself, I'm definitely in that second group of freaks,
      and some of my assumptions are probably dead wrong, but those main
      elements of this theory the structures and some other findings may
      persist and sustain. And I actually <font color="#cccccc">except
        (</font>expect<font color="#cccccc"> to accept)</font> some
      academic recognition in the following three years or so. Even
      though I was recently told that <font size="+1">Ignaz Semmelweis
        was disregarded for awhile because MDs are psychopaths: see
        Semmelweis effect. Gregor Mendel's founding of genetics was
        completely ignored for thirty something years </font>I began
      that path believing that anything can be achieved in mere ten
      years, also they say history goes faster than before, so I expect
      it to take society ten years to recognize what it's all about. And
      it's been over six years now since I went public, so..<br>

          reform the academia, leave it completely, create your own
          castle on clearer spot and firmer ground.</font><br>
        My next task on this way is to create some information resource,
        where all ALL the information on the planet earth.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">I will be in freaky nebulas, because I
        refered to people standart academia doesn't dare to mention. I
        will be their weak bond to some obscure linguistics of more
        academic figures, with all the respect academic, my punk rock is
        justified, but as I said in the very beginning, some of them are
        alright, some of them are very alright (who?), but i don't know
        any very alright individual in linguistics, even myself is too
        weird to be a king, and above whom? fuck them, gosh. But they
        milk go-t, but insane militaries milk the goat much better, it
        doesn' make me want' to participate in their deeds. But what if
        we make military actions agains us ineffective? they are not
        interested, because they want to reserve the possibility to
        successfully bomb their own population if they must, for
        themselves. or am I just way too cynical?<br>
        and here I realize (a couple of months later actually, I'm half
        through this volume now) that business is the new science. Those
        cool guys who dropped unis they made it not in academia, but in
        business.<br>
        You can change the world via business too. And I watched pe<a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89Vpqm2IaPE"><font
            color="#cccccc">t</font></a>erson my man no matter what
        explained that different people have different roles in
        business: conscientious people are good as managers, and creatve
        people are good at bringing up new ideas. You need managers when
        you know what you're doing. You need creative people when you
        don't know what you're doing. I will practice what I just
        preached, because I was the one who motivated my mom to make
        business and I wasn't much needed ever since, I guess she knows
        what to do, she has some creativity herself, even though she's
        very conscientious unlike me, who is irresponsible as fuck.<br>

      See how halaḥam follow the tradition I've seen first in Arabic
      vowel diacritics:<br>
      unlike philippines writing system make it, here u gets a high
      mark, and i gets a low mark, which would be more natural for me as
      a child (elephant is high, so why his sound is low? and mouse is
      visa versa)<br>

      <img src="img/141.png" alt="" width="378" height="404"><br>
      But here we see why it could be: in philippines the order is AIU,
      and this one is the other order, and it makes these writing
      systems related to ogham of all things, which could be related to
      some berber ancients. The following research is needed, and it's
      time to add english version of colored ge'ez to vol.1.<br>

      This time I also noticed what I misse the first time (other than
      хы хо во in ge'ez part) the other b-line, in the final row of ኀ:
      not only ጰ, but also some ፐ which is out of the structure, and yet
      to be archeologized in the archives of ethiopean philology.<br>
      <br>
      (that piece I copy-pasted from vol.1 where I just put it. well, at
      least for those who missed this edition, because he reads vol.2 or
      3 when I update vol.1<br>
      And more than that to speak more about it not overcomplicating
      vol.1 with this autism:<br>
      <br>
      ሀ and በ oppose each other as a opposes б if you can see it. and we
      were talking of b reflecting d this way, but a &amp; d are
      probably historically the same letter, then e is c, o is ?, u is
      v=в=b, and we return to A reflecting V which is D reflecting B, I
      hope you follow this.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc"><br>
        And suddenly.. halaḥam, ogham (both has u's before i's)<br>
        ham is a rude person in russian (хам) <br>
        so does it make cultures that let i's (thin people, ladies(?))
        front more civilized? than those where big ones go first because
        it's better not to stand on their way: if they fall on you it
        may be a naughty knock-out. only guessing, hardly scientific is
        this guess, but hypotheses do belong scientific literature, I
        already said why, they can be proven or disproven by the reader.
        They also remind the reader, that some scientific information is
        not valid, even when it is displayed arrogantly certainly it can
        be false or wrong.</font><br>
      <br>
      I speak of someting important and on the same breath I speak of
      something hardly right or important, at least I can put it into
      grey. <font color="#cccccc">and it was here before I copypasted
        that vol.1 thing + its autism, so it's not on the same breath</font><br>
      <br>
      ሀ (a) turning into ሁ (u) in its diacritic form could be an attempt
      to notify u when it comes out of a and into u as it is bሀs, but
      abሁse. or it could be some other story, but actually I came here
      to say that in this ሀ both a &amp; u meet, it could be from those
      time when A &amp; U wasn't separated, but that sets an important
      question of how would people distinguish speech if so many now
      different things were the same.<br>

      The beginning of this volume will always want me to do something
      else, so embarrasing it is.<br>
      But I keep on digging, because sometimes some treasures appear.<br>
      <br>
      I also write in my notebooks (another portion of scans is coming
      in several months only, when the summer comes, I don't want to go
      there before that)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Russian orthography is made up by the germans (and etymology too)
      yet<br>
      if we write russian word for blue not the way they tell us, but
      the way we speak it, it's синии, сини is also that word (a short
      form of it) thus that reminds very much egyptian 𓏭 and 𓏼
      standing in egyptian grammar for a suffix of plural form.<br>
      <br>
      That made me think that what if russian has roots to those ancient
      languages of the past, and it doesn't mean aothers don't. And I
      know we all do, we relate them one way or another, and what if
      it's so fit we can write russian in it and read it rather easily
      because the things there sound like ours? What if egyptian
      hieroglyphs could be read in oter cultures by their scolars who
      could read it in their own language? I can test it right here,
      let's find how blue is in egyptian, and if it's near s, it is
      interesting.<br>
      <br>
      http://hieroglyphs.net doesn't know neither blue nor green, but it
      knows man, it's s, and it doesn't help.<br>
      and for whatever reason in reads king not how it's written,
      because it's literally satan:<br>

      while I was trying to find what I believe to be a berry, I found a
      weird sign I saw somewhere else:<br>
      𓊖 looks like one of phaestos disk's so whether the forger took
      this peculiar sign from egyptian, or that disk is authentic script
      not far from egyptian (then we have to compare these two, even
      though I posted someone showing how phaestos disk is a fraud, but
      I didn't read into that myself, so I can keep my intellectual
      freedom on this subject)<br>

      <br>
      once again about tolkien:<br>
      He's littered the pool of linguistic information with his invented
      writing systems.<br>
      The only writing system he took without much change (but to which
      he only made several weird additions) was nordic runes Nazi
      Germany was researching the most. And of course those runes were
      used by the bad guys (I'm speaking of Uruk Runes. Cyrth was much
      more different than the anglo saxon runes, and I don't know if
      calling some nation dwarves is actually flattering)<br>
      But when some Norwegian journalist noticed that, Tolkien cared
      enough to try to refute it with his response about him not having
      a slightest intention to have such parallels in mind, that he's
      apolitical and blablabla, that he's very offended by that
      interpretation of his work (as if it was much more than mere
      propaganda)<br>
      &gt; In the Foreword to the revised edition of The Lord of the
      Rings, Tolkien cautioned strongly against viewing it as an
      allegory, saying that he disliked allegory himself. Furthermore,
      according to his own claims, Tolkien denounced Hitler, Nazi
      beliefs, "race-doctrine" and apartheid and praised the Jews,
      calling them a "gifted people".<br>
      <br>
      Jews are gifted people alright, but even not speaking of the
      nature of that gift, that guy licks their asses for politically
      correct reasons, and he is successful, so maybe someone will learn
      from his example. But as for that work it would be a false note, I
      sympathize them and I dare I say it, fear them, even that, but
      that's another reason for me to be brave and honest, also because
      as Camus righteously said, nothing is more despicable than respect
      based on fear.<br>
      And though I lack that very portion of respect, I still offer some
      ambiadvantageous solutions, because it's the most rational thing
      to do in this situation. Hate the sin, not the sinner, remember?<br>
      People have little to no responsibility for whether genome they
      were born with or the culture they were plunged into. But both
      factors can be improved by genetic therapies and friendly
      counteractions.<br>
      Do you call such rants friendly? Yes, I do, honesty is friendly.
      Just as banters, they help us all evolve. Even when it hurts, its'
      medicinal, really.<br>
      <font color="#ffffff" size="-1"><br>
        Only now have I realized why does this work sound antisemitic
        (4снад screenshot was only natural) and that's the notion that
        semitic linguistic, the very centre of it, rots. Even though I <br>
        show that every other branch is not much better (I don't, I'm an
        antisemite, because many jews will not like that. Then let's not
        notice it. keep it in mind, but at least hide it from a plain
        sight, they will survive, help them) and I was brainwashed by
        some jew saying "antisemite as every great russian writer"
        Zionists support antisemitism. And they're white.
        overcompensate.<br>

      Back to that J is L hermesy, <br>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBjOs-egFMs"><font
          color="#000000">Here</font></a> a drunk mason claims that
      jewish god is Lucifer, and where I took I sent this response:<br>
      <blockquote class="postMessage" id="m3263153">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        Sombody didn't make his homework properly and got it all wrong.<br>
        Jesus and Lucifer is probably the same figure.<br>
        The jewish god though is the satan (as Book of Revelation
        righteously repeats at least twice)<br>
        In early christianity (aka gnosticism) Jesus was allegorically
        reprsented as a snake. And there are some ancient images, on
        coins for example with snake on a cross.<br>
        Masonry seems to be some gnostic school of whatever, though I'm
        not sure we really need this mumbo-jumbo for anything else other
        than to comprehend the rationale of those top-rank religious
        pricks. They'd rather have you not knowing the difference
        between good and evil, for being ignorant you would obey much
        easier and with less of uncomfortable quesions. <br>
        Also many satanists borrowed the Lucifer's image from his
        enemies, who are the Devils themselves (Mary'ed people, if I
        understand it right that Devil is suffixed form of Deva and Evil
        is of Eve, but of course it all seems pretty relativistic today,
        even though women and evil are on the same side in Tai Chi, but
        probably because when we're in love our hormones drive us dement
        (which could be a suffixed form of demon: mad is beshen in
        russian, bes is a demon) but that hormone disbalance's our
        problem, gals shouldn't be held responsible, that would be some
        catholic-tier satanism, and it makes the world uglier: a good
        excuse for ugly muslims who hate beauty, because Lucifer is told
        to be the prettiest of all the angels and the most beloved of
        that heavenly king who is a satan in palms of whom this world is
        until Esus comes back for good, but that reference make it all
        even more complicated, some ancient cults with their savage
        barbarian traditions, we should't be reconstructing those stages
        of our society, maybe only to look at it and laugh, because by
        laugh we get rid of the past)<br>
        Also both Jesus and Lucifer bear the title of Moring Star (the
        very last plot-twist of the new testament) and so on.</blockquote>

            seth, who was not only satan but also the third son of some
            biblical figure, so the trick of this rite is that we should
            realy take it easy because we're not capable of

      <font color="#999999">Informational singularity is probably here,
        according to how fast information travels. It was just yesterday
        when I found that I probably turned a good guy named
        proteineinsaider insane with my spheric capsule thing. Or maybe
        he just looks this way, because his poor drawing skills and with
        his being a lady maybe, otherwise why'd he use so much pink.
        That would explain it a lot. I also foud some AnyaLove000001 who
        is whether that proteineinsaider or a huge fan of his (her first
        posting is years after it appeared at 2ch, but it literally uses
        tag моё for something very similar to what (s)he posted at 2ch
        and later she uses proteineinsaider's work with title of С
        просторов интернета на тему вечной автономной капсулы, as if she
        knew about it because somebody in the comments told her about
        it, but I suppose it's for conspiracy (для конспирации, a
        disguise) but why I mention it here is that I should be careful
        with all this information, because it can lead people further
        out of balance. I wish that lady well. And I will probably
        contact her to use her in our documentary (a friend from tv is
        making a film with me and some other weird guys, and I openly
        highjack his project into a direction he will also like) so that
        lady who tells that Jesus is Lucifer published it probably a
        year ago (according to the comments) and she could also be
        influenced by me, so at this point I should be careful with
        references, not to bring some circular references. Either way,
        references never proved anything, no matter how important they
        become in contemporary academia (which is still a bunch of
        faggots, pun intended)</font><br>

      : seconds in and I've already realized that those skulls could be
      representing female figures (it became more obvious when I
      explored that rostral opening) and this hypothesis can be
      confirmed if some terracotta used to complete the sculpture, or
      refuted if such artifacts are never found. A decade ago I noticed
      that some terracotta crucifices look pretty much like bovine
      skulls and now this. <br>

      Russian band Нуки can be transliterated as Noockie, if we want to
      make a magic four-letter name (кино, cure, abba) into
      seven-lettern name (madonna, michael jackson)<br>
      but it shows how it's similar to russians, which is rooskie in
      russian (c is always read as in cinema in russian, like s) rookie
      is новичок, новобранец, рекрут, n instead of r makes it
      new-russians, as if n is another r, Н another R, h ~ R, п looks
      exactly like n in cursive, п is p in lating, p is r in russian. We
      are noockie, but it looks like носки (socks) and many russian
      surnameds end на sky.<br>
      And ruckie is probably <br>

      как может N быть Т это понятно, обе язычны, но как мог П оказаться

      see how many cases of lingual and labial having met!<br>
      also m is both M &amp; T, n is both N &amp; P (looks like since N
      and M are invariants, and one is lingual, the other is labial, all
      the letters after them are their whispering invariants: but why
      not T to M &amp; not P to N, but in reverse? if M and N are
      ivariants, then so is T &amp; П, 3 &amp; 2, both are пара, so what

      and initially it was not 6 digits per die, but only 4 (ctrlF vol.1
      for ашички)<br>
      <br>
      and because there were only 3 vowels... or could there be 4 vowels
      already when that divination appeared? then... one bone is left,
      the other right and... which is vowel which is consonant? or is it
      labial and lingual and vowels don't play here, they are for

      Ruck is чернь (rookie is probably related, as fookie would be

      I missed MSPaint so I found KolourPaint, it works well, like that
      one, maybe even better, but text cannot be copy-pasted when you
      still type it there. And now I cannot exit it directly, let's keep
      this drafty leaf there, for those who doesn't see it, it tells
      that glagolitic vowels are double forms of european, so he who
      invented it probably did it on purpose so someone who knows
      european and knows the keys can read it (thus it could be invented
      if not by kirl, by some other nationalist, I should be not biased,
      but based) I missed E: in glagolica it has not three strokes, but
      four (or not 1 but 2 depending on how you look at that)<br>
      and their ω looks like double ω.<br>
      <br>
      And I don't know why that pdf cuts the M's balls, but in this form
      M also looks like double M, two inverted M's, doubleW:<br>
      <img src="V_files/glagolythic-edit2.png" alt="" width="362"
        height="388"><br>
      And L looks like double lamed, so now I wouldn't be surprised if
      that was some later form of alphabet, fabricated by doubling the
      wide-known european ones, But what if other european alphabets
      just simplified this form? But where are archeologic evidence of
      the spread of glagolitic writing? In greek cursive δ looks like Ⰴ
      as it's written on the table below: <font color="#cccccc">(and in
        that first one with text on it)</font><br>

      but where did that fifth vowel were? In hebrew it's F, and in
      russian vowel Ё stands at that place, but it doesn't make much

      E is not only Esus, but also El, and is it el = the? because ה =
      the.<br>

      It reflectls IK for Isus Kristos (in yiddish it's yoshke krist, in
      hebrew it's <span title="" class=""><span class="tlid-translation

            amharic: እየሱስ ክርስቶስ iyesusi kirisitosi and in japanese:
            イエス・キリスト Iesu Kirisuto (but then again they teach that J is
            an invariant of I so IK = JK = JC<br>
            <br>
            Is JK BC (Б-Г) but in scream or whistle?<br>

            Isn't JC possible to be read as geeze! cheese is holy, it
            doesn't rot as much as other food. it can be held relatively
            safely without being cooked, probably that's why in russian
            cheese is сыр, which could be short form of сырой (raw) and
            that could also explain why cheese with mold can be consumed
            and it's sold to the rich<font color="#cccccc">, probably
              that's a dairie's way to laugh at them, as niggers laugh
              at them drinking copi luwak, as who knows what culinary
              traditions could take roots in deceit: tobacco was used
              for driving evil spirits away, the pipe of peace was
              probably using something way more shamanic, and always
              well, nobody should have died of such pipe, otherwise it
              could be the only peace they'd get. Cannabis seem to be
              that megic pipe that doesn't make it worse. Even though I
              saw cases of panic under the influence of it, but nodody

            IFBW is intuitively translated as <font color="#ffffff">I

        color="#cccccc"> (fade)</font> the variants into white, for your
      pleasure. my honour.<br>
      <br>
      honor is гонор in russian and it's temper, not hoor. <br>
      but temper is next to honor, thus that typo above is of no value:
      whores are the opposite of гонор, мэйби онли ту зэя хасбандс, but
      actually whore is no honour,&nbsp; honor ~is~ not a whore, bitch
      has some honour, but I don't like bitches, but I do not like whore
      either, in every woman I find some flaw not to be disturbed from
      my magical science oh magnificient science, looks what I'm doing,
      probably wouldn't be able to do if my cock was sucked. But I never
      really tried fat women, oh they're so easy to dismiss, fat looked
      ugly to me as to many other guys, only recently have I began
      looking at their plump cunts as when they're in clothes, I only
      avert when I imagine their bellies bigger than their tits, it's as
      if I fuck some fat dude, I don't mind titless gals really, even
      though pedoa is taboo to me, but if they're slim I watched a lot
      of fashion magazines to find bonies attractive af. Should I design
      clothes for fatsos to fuck? Should I pretend to be gay not to
      sleep with my models or should I claim my asexuality and then
      should I demand my A in their lgbt quiz or should I sustain from
      their озабоченного community?<br>
      I guess it will be a bridge for h to join their party, and what
      other reasons for heroin addicts to join gay community if not to
      sell drugs? to make monety (what a magnificient typo for mone!@Y)
      монетой,? из ит уот зыс нью тайпо теллс? I was talking of
      heterosexuals, but if gay is g, straight is S, and that is gay af.
      (some gay voice "you're the bottom" and it all relies to that

      <br>
      Back to that IFBW (and that the name for one of my bands, because
      they all may differ) and it a little surprises me that it's as if
      I tried to say I'm, but mentioned all the other labials instead
      (is V ~ N ~ M?)<br>
      And I was also surprised to notice, that Feed and Fuck are
      somewhat similar; Both is similar to Black, because if I fuck the
      blacks, I do fuck the whites, whites are more valuable where I
      live; (I read that ; was used to be a ?, but here it's a form of
      ,) Women and Wolves, or Wolverines (are those two species
      misinterpreted as ВорОны (Crows) and ВОроны (Ravens) in russian?)
      <br>
      And I tried to decipher some wide-known abbreviatours with that
      formula, and the first I found was FBI, which I immediately
      translated as Fuck Bad Individuals (actually the first guess was
      Fuck Black Individuals, but I thought that it's a racist
      misconception to call them blacks, because they're actually
      different shades of brown, but brown also begins with B, so that
      could be where I hit the core of that: B is yin, T(D) is yang,
      both black and bad are yin features, afaik) far isn't fuck or
      feed.. We'll wait for other hypothetic bandnames to find other
      basal meanings of cool official abbreviatures)<br>
      <br>
      That IFBW thing appeared <font color="#cccccc">(in this terms,
        the concept is at least a couple of years old, and the concept
        of which it's a part of is much more ancient decision to keep
        neutrality in the battle between angels and demons, trying to
        negotiate peace between the parties for mutual benefits) </font>after













































      I met Nuki, and realized that they're pretty jewish, and АХС are
      the opposite (even though some people say Hitler was a jew) and
      good thing is I realized they don't need money (the jews have all
      the money in the world) so I will keep on donating to AXC only, to
      avoid being a glore.. I mean, glory-hunter, and here it seems how
      the words appear: a bro is a huge football fan, and he went to
      some game in London, where he found the term глоры, as if he was
      told "those are glores we don't like them" probably he was told
      "those are glory hunters", but he considered hunters be some sort
      of bastards, as if glory is the term per so, because -y is how you
      make plural in russian. (somehow some time ago I found the term
      glors or glores, as if it was shortened for glory-hunters, so I
      searched for glory-hunters and found many times urbandictionary
      saying it's those fans who always support the winning team, and
      only some gothic whores (goth-loli-whores?) for glores (non for
      glors)<br>
      Or I found it because глоры is a term in russian football fans
      terminology: has brother found it there? or have he sew it there?
      nah, 592 million cases of глор in google. Or is it a common
      mistake of the foreigners? probably so, or urbandictionary doesn't
      register brittish slang (I tried a few brit.slang.terms I know and
      it seems it knows) <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      that academia.edu thing, I like them: they just recommended me to
      read The White Godd<a

      I wanted to do for such a long time, and now I see it has
      references to King Jesus I probably stumbled upon trying to read
      it the last time. Now I ctrlFed it for alphabet, and try it out by
      yourself, I haven't read the b<a

      yet (download pdf with text. who ever needs pdf without text when
      they weigh the same!) <br>
      <br>
      And here I understand another reason for my work unfit for the
      other academia: it discovers that information from somebody they
      disregarded happened to be the authentic and more accurate then
      the record they preserved (or have they left it out to disturb
      those fields and thus they preserved some doors we can now travel
      just as RGraves probably traveled to discover that they were five
      vowels and B/T <br>

      recommendd me I think of jews who probably produce all that good
      black stuff, and Suddenly I realize we cannot kill the jews,
      because they contain enourmous ammount of knowledge and culture:
      in russia they probably killed most of intelligent people, but
      they probably kept few good ones to teach their children, so their
      children would be the only cultured ones (and some goy-dogs can
      eat whatever falls from their masters' tables) I'm so mean at the
      way I deliver this stuff, but I dare to say it because... ah, I
      would dare anyway, but I make it so boldly because this good je<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDeCl3w2wo0"><font
          color="#000000">w</font></a> told me (yes, good jews are
      another reason holocoast must be prevented, some jews are great,
      as any other population has its percentage of brighties, it's only
      the most of overexposed jews that annoy us, but no need to throw
      the babies with the water, god knows we're all shit, different
      proportions of shit in each of us, but probably noone has that
      proportion at zero) That thought began few hours before that when
      I thought of musical education mostly jews was welcome into, so it
      seems to me when I look at my friends, musical school gives so
      many benefits to the child's development: they <br>

      This session (from "I'm going to keep these rants..") is so
      productive (I smoked weed twice though) because this is the
      session I also figured out E. Elias Merhige probably didn't film
      Begotten and Cryptorchid, but stole it from the artsy cinema he
      liked to get into as a kid (just compare those two and the birds
      to to his other crap and how he struggled to imitate that style in
      Antichrist Superstar, but it don't belong here, I analyzed it well
      elsewhere, and here I said enough for anyone to line the dots) and
      also found that Pizza Face (one of the first videos with Flea,
      which let me into RHCP rabbit hole with Irons and his role in
      Pearl Jam, and their song Immortality, Is it about heroin? some
      satanic shit I discover, and why do I share it so unnecessarily?
      Oh gosh, some part of me wants to die, but my allies are too
      strong for any perpetrator to stay safe. I also said I will turn
      it all into something friendly with my plot twists. So don't get
      jumpy, ai or any enhanced intelligence will figure it all in a

      <br>
      Funny that it also goes vowel-labial-linguals, if we look by
      pronounciation of the actual words.<br>
      Funny, that the final letter of the first line is to (十) in 十日
      [とおか] but in all other cases it's じゅう so I'm not sure if this
      similarity I found in a dictionary is reliable. <br>
      Funny, that that form of to in first line is read as do, as D in
      the first line of the alphabet.<br>
      Funny, that it's I, that is read as 1 sometimes, and 一 is read as
      い [i] <br>
      Funny, that ro can be a later grammatic suffix or vowel added in
      sanskrit.<br>
      Funny, that only one syllable in the labial word<br>
      Funny, that third word is all lingual syllables.<br>
      Funny, that there're 7 signs in the first line, just as if 7
      musical notes, for which those 7 syllables are used, and 8th most
      probably isn't (jisho.org translates only those 7 as musical
      notes)<br>
      <br>
      Let's rewrite the first line, this time in text:<br>
      いろはにほへと &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iro ha nihoheto &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      色は匂えど &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iro wa nioedo &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      So I guess that the first form of this line could have been in
      this form: いはと (i wa do) <br>
      And in this I cross out linguists reconstruction of ancient form
      of は as of ha (because hu is fu, and there was something else I
      don't remember at the moment)<br>
      いはと<br>
      Funny, that cursive א is very similar to い (the same strokes only
      in different order, and japanese is written in the different
      direction)<br>
      Funny, that は graphically reminds B, or even more so Б<br>
      Funny, that と reminds both c &amp; d (and thus stands for both,
      see ᚦ)<br>
      <br>

      what if not and into are relatives and one is negation of the

      what if into is i-not as بلى (bala) is yes in arabic (bu is no in
      chinese, lo is no in hebrew, if those two syllables are
      etymologically negations giving middleasternly evasive
      confirmation of "not no"?<br>

      and I was given a perfect answer: &gt;where the left-hand side has
      to be interpreted as being the value obtained by using one of the
      aforementioned summation methods and not as the sum of an infinite
      series in its usual meaning.<br>
      But it the semi-trolling mode I didn't even notice it, trying to
      turn it all into a joke. I didn't even notice, here is how we can
      learn, returning to the words we said which text form allows.
      forms allow. that s..<br>
      form allows many allow, it just does. allowed is probably once, ed
      as in edin (един, one, an) -an is the russian form of -ed.<br>
      Thus <font color="#cc0000">N is final by design, it's a form of D</font>.<br>
      and that perfect answer still didn't answer why did they use name
      and notation of something else. Is it because in India notation
      was different and they unified those systems in such a weird way,

      It is here because I already spoke about false or overobscured
      concepts in other fields of science, now it is time for math.<br>
      I am very suspicious about imaginary numbers, and will make

        That rant about Bologne where I never was was caused by
        something I heard, and though I realize it's completely not sane
        to be tHAT politically incorrect, I must also set an example of
        not being affraid of anything, so I proceded to read some about
        Bologne University and in russian wiki (in 02 2020) it's said
        that the university appeared as a law school to compete the one
        in Ravenna (in english wiki I don't see that) and that Ravenna
        was in opposition to Rome and Bologne was in good conditions
        with Rome (which already controlled another university, in
        Paris, because that one was theologic, and at first Bologne was
        independent university, but eventually Rome got their levers in
        it too, when they demanded a theology department after fine arts
        began teaching medicine too, as far as I got it, could be wrong
        on the bla bal asusal<br>
        So here I've shown that catholic church did establish university
        system, they never really was in opposition, lead what you
        cannot stop, hold your enemies closer than your friends. wise
        politics keeps this obviously fraudulent structure of the church
        in favor of jurisprudence, because those jus juris are in the
        centre of the structure of our society, the true spiders, and I
        dare to fly out of their network, rude.<br>
        <br>
        And I was looking for what ancient university has name similar
        to Phones, and I only see Sorbonne. Is F сорное B?<br>
        phoney and phony two similar words. </font><br>

      I'm not even sure that math part should really be here, but as I
      said, being in the very beginning of the ponderpath is not a
      reason enough to exclude this outta here, this book probably saw

        "theorem" of Jan-Erik Roos in 1961 stated that in an [AB4*]

        disproved by counterexample in 2002 by Amnon Neeman.</font>
      episode can reveal where the fabric of the math itself tears out
      of the grasp os some spider net of overcomplications and I wonder
      how far can it tear. if x^0 being 1 is amon those false concepts
      referring to one another, I won't be surprised, but of course this
      course could be a manifestation of some grandeur delusion on my
      side, even though psychology is not a true science just as its
      marriage to pharmacology also isn't. some Dunning–Kruger effect it
      can be. or the opposite.<br>
      But at least then you'll probably see my comprehension of those
      weird fields of math you all probably would also like to
      understand. Zeta function, I am coming after you!<br>
      <br>
      One good think I can say about Bologne U: is that there students
      were the boss.A good example and a perfect standart for any other
      uni of the kind. Also those universities, no matter how flawed,
      probably were a grasp of fresh air in the comparison to the darker
      ages before that.<br>
      And though the scent appearing there from the very beginning is
      the root of the poor state science and education are in today, I
      probably should show some respect to those legacies? Or maybe I
      shouldn't.<br>
      It's none of my business bashing the collapsing colossus, <font

      It's where it makes sense to them, as if it's some modified

      And that fluctuation happens somewhere on the other end of the
      string we were supposed to find by the summation. Why would we
      look at the other end? Is it because that's where 1-1+1-1.. equals
      1/2? at the base of it? where the function was written down by the
      initial number in the substantial part and the rest of he function

      left to right) if my comparisons don't look like relating to
      either of these representations of phoenician (the one above and

      also 𐤅, which stands where F is, looks just like Y (especially in
      the image) which combines Y &amp; F even stronger than 𐤉 standing
      for i, or they even transliterate as Y in that image, looking just
      like inverted F.<br>
      And if we recognize Ḥ as fowel (vowel) - just as H is E, and EWZ
      is a linge alright - then ḤṬY (𐤇 𐤈 𐤉) could be another line,
      which places L into vowel position and LMN becomes a valid line.

      Socrates taught both monotheism and pederasty, and it could be not
      a coincidence: before monotheism at least duality was present,
      after that some hermaphrodite appeared instead of Hermes and
      Aphrodite.<br>
      <br>
      There also was a more explicit form of обожение in polytheism,
      monotheism stopped that, but only until baby Jesus came, but not
      for long, the antichrist of Saul tuned it all back but forcing his
      way claiming that J was that very monotheistic g.o.d. himselſ.
      Even though J himself taught that he is OUR celestial father, and
      that he baby j is no different in that we all can do what he did.<br>

      B is buki in russian, and now I wonder if that letter represents a
      couple of books? Like old and new testament maybe, or since the
      form appeared before Christ, could this meme of two testaments be
      older than that? Like old and new eddas or something.<br>

      <br>
      Waves of information brought me something relating to what this
      work begins with and it also mentions some other ogham. I will ask
      the author what it all means after I read this chapter myself:<br>
      <br>
      <a

      <br>
      So I asked:<br>
      <span class="js-non-expanded-comment">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        <span class="js-non-expanded-comment">The word ogham used in
          page 14 - how does that term relates to the ogham the writing
          system and where is the best to read about it was my question,

            target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.kenttreeogham.co.uk/ogham/</a>
          where it also tells "Like alpha-beta, the ogham is sometimes
          called by its first letters, beth luis fearn or beith luis
          nin." Which is the question of when did Beth-luis-nun become
          beth-luis-fearn, and doesnt beth-luis-nuin term tell that
          earlier form of ogham was not quinary but ternary?</span></span><br>

      I also wanted to ask him<br>
      &gt; seven Maines and seven Manus of the Irish Texts and of the
      Indian Puranic myths... sons of Medb and Mādhavi <br>
      <br>
      Letter M has some special position in the alphabet. I also read
      somewhere that every letter stands for some deity. Could you
      please look if you can tell which religious tradition fits the
      alphabetic structure the most?<br>
      <br>
      but I decided not to. at least for now.<br>
      <br>
      <br>

      but instead I contacted another big man, with this letter the

      &gt; Луна соответствует чакре сердца, а лунные узлы Раху и Кету<br>
      Раха и Кет - нзвание этих дополнительных чакр? <br>
      Эти три чакры - три фазы Луны? (триединое божество в
      дохристианской традиции было женского пола (тридеви хронологически
      раньше тримурти) и общеиндоевропейским:
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moirai (три женщины, молодая,
      взрослая, старая как фазы луны растущая, полная, стареющая)<br>
      Фазы луны намекают на четвёртую ноту (мёртвую?) сокрытую
      (захороненую?) и в алфавите (который по легенде был этим же
      триединым божеством создан (aeiou.ru) uvw имеют четвёртую сестру:
      y (а ъыь имеют то ли б то ли ѣ, но б-ѣ имя табуированное, но и не
      факт что это связано, потому что иначе это и есть dieu bla,
      Deva'l, Eve'l, ибо в тай-чи солнцу противопоставлена луна, но lune
      = moon, maður = man говорит о том что это слово матриархальной
      культуры? Тогда как S-n это и Son, и Sun, и Satan, божество
      которому плевать на наши молитвы? тогда как луна непосредственно
      связана с жидкостями на нашей планеты, что объясняет
      противопоставление воды и огня, но луна ассоциировалась с
      зеркалом, в которое лишь смотрится земля? потому что материнский
      культ связан с землёй, змеёй? god ~ гад? это какое-то гадание,
      извините за сырую информацию, но я не ожидал что гадание так
      похоже на гад, это камлание? нет, это что-то другое скорее всего,
      но земля как раз жертвы (удобрения) принимает, может индусы потому
      и уважают матушек коров, <br>
      http://www.symbolarium.ru/index.php/Корова - Основные значения:
      Великая Мать, богини Луны;<br>
      я видел конечно корову с луной (ниже пишут, что с солнцем) меж
      рогов, и что рога в форме месяца, серпа? mes меч в монгольском
      вроде и нож в нидерландском, месник и мясо могут тоже быть от
      этого месяца<br>
      https://www.newacropol.ru/Alexandria/symbols/cow/ - Она также
      представляла луну и небо; ее рога напоминали полумесяц, а молоко
      ассоциировалось с Млечным Путем. Встречающиеся изображения коровы
      с диском Солнца между рогами являются отражением идеи о небесной
      корове-матери, которая заботится о Солнце в течение ночи. Великая
      Мать и лунные богини зачастую изображались с коровьими рогами.<br>

      Когда я думаю стоит ли мне отправлять копию этой книги в синагогу,
      как я в некоторой степени обещал. Я думаю не дразни гусей: гуси
      довольно мирные ребята, но если их разозлить, можно получить как
      следует. <br>
      <br>
      И меня осеняет: гус джус, не те ли это гуси что спасли мир
      (интересно будет почитать как именно) гуси что спасли рим я хотел
      написать, но джус сэйвд зы уорлд? эм ай крэйзи? бат зэя ауа

      русские зайчики, евреи гусята, носята, гнусята, гундоситъ,&nbsp;
      надо для остальных наций подумать.<br>
      americans eagles? зайчики завидуют птицам обзывают петухами всех?
      блядь как же я сука охуел<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      А̃<br>
      это один символ сверху, и это каким-то образом я начало чататься в
      обратную сторону: <br>
      вики на эту букву выдаёт Ꙗ, ꙗ, а в А̃ здесь есть прабел, попробуй
      выделить эту букву, она необычная. И словно ~ есть и (и всё это
      читается в обратную сторону)<br>
      И это перекликается с тем, что Я и I (ай) также произносятся в
      противоположные стороны.<br>
      Ⱑ is what's used in glagolica instead of Ꙗ (three pieces of Ⱑ tell
      it couild be three mothers, and fourth is traditionally hidden, if
      it's in 3d) Ⱑ три матери? и гласная А, и язычная J и губная? Ю is
      IO and it's the very Я in italian, jo in spannish, Я could be a
      way to write Ⱑ<br>
      I need to find out what tradition uses А̃ in the first place.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      евреи не только гуси, но и лисы, что удивительно в свете того, что
      л и г перекликаются своими формами и вот такими примерами. go no
      lo? what are other examples? I just found a new<font

      третья буква в этой группе - й и она попадает прямо в цель: йуси,
      йоси <font color="#cccccc">ez</font><br>
      Если так я могу эту букву крутить, то давай покрутим и остальные:
      лисы лусы? теряют добычку когда за ними гонятся? волк бы уволок,
      он сильный.<br>
      лисы гуси козы? что между ними общего? гуси вкусни, козы вкозны
      входят, но это подгон под ответ какой-то, ассоциативные связи.
      ассоциативное мышление самый примитос, гони на абстрактном. но
      абстрактное ближе к математике, а ей можно что угодно... это я
      повёлся на какой-то засёр науки, который хапанул и в котором
      заслуженно даже поучаствовал, матеша не докажет, что 2+2=3
      например, это бред и ошибочность его доказывается на основе
      определений двух и трёх, 1=0 получится если это принять, а то

      Я назыаю русских зайцами (русаки - порода зайцев, в детстве
      мальчиков зайчиками наряжают (а девочек белочками. но чаще
      снежинками, так дешевле)) но зачастую их называют медведями.<br>
      Волки и лисы только прикрываются зайчиками чтоб обстряпывать свои
      грязные дела? Алсо зайчики когда не загорелы беленькие, лисоньки
      кстати тоже беленькими бывают, волки бывают белыми если полярны,
      но их серая шкура позволяет чеченцам ассоциироваться с волками.
      Русские зачастую хотят ассоциироваться с медведями, но тогда им
      нужно жить на севере, потому что все белые медведи там, здесь их
      скорей всего вырезали. Может затем и вырезали, чтоб русские с
      белыми медведями себя не ассоциировали. В этом свете слава
      Трактору за продвижение образа белого медведя (в современном мире
      в любом случае ни бурым ни белым медведям нечего делать на воле.

      USA is further to south, and they have bears walking their streets
      robbing their trashcans, and there are no white bears in USA
      except Alaska, which used to be russian, thus it was a noble
      gesture to sell it to USA so they have their own white bears too.
      But still bear is associated with brown gay raper there<br>

      В центральной России, до того как она была завоёвана русскими,

      another case of B as first letter have found me:<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      And that pdf gave the source of that image and I went to that site
      for more, and I searched it for alphabet and the first gem I found
      also had b as the first letter:<br>
      <br>

          src="V_files/enoch2.gif" alt="" border="0" width="424"
          height="1024"></a><br>
      and it was a decyphering of this sequence:<br>

        height="120"><br>
      <br>
      this interesting B to T thing suddely makes eochian alphabet more
      reliable to me, and that is from glorious John Dee, whom I liked
      before, but mostly because we share the name.<br>
      <br>
      I wonted to collect all the alphabets, so it's a good context for
      this part I craved to know but was too materialistically snobbish
      to d<font color="#cccccc">w</font>elve into.<br>
      But the fact that b &amp; d are not opposed make me turn on
      scepcis back. p &amp; q are but in the opposite way I'd expect
      them to be when I compared them to Ⰲ&amp;Ⰴ, but then again P could
      stand for d (papa &amp; daddy) while q could be a form of b (baba
      &amp; queen) <br>
      <br>
      But Agrippa's Of Occult Philosophy, Book II. (part 2) seemed
      unreliable to me: it contradicts what I know and what I don't know
      also don't ring no bell, as if he made it all up (except some
      banal יהוה thing)<br>
      But then I notice he also knows Īv̄ X̄ <font color="#cccccc">здесь

      I think I demand his attention if you think how I dare, I don't
      take this transcendentant stuff seriously, not directly, but as
      with christianity: people who dig it don't dig deep, they're

        I think was the word</font><br>
      <br>
      and while I was looking for those macroned letter I found
      something interesting:<br>
      https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/burts#Latvia<a
        href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/burts#Latvian"><font
          color="#000000">n</font></a><br>
      <font size="+1">Originally the masculine past participle of the
        verb burt (“to conjure magic”) (q.v.). Just as burt originally
        meant “to carve (marks, on a tree),” burts was originally
        “mark(s) carved on a tree.” Cognates include Lithuanian bùrtas
        (“lot, (pl.) sorcery”).[1]</font><br>
      isn't this find at this very moment magic? If I asked if Agrippa
      based, I think I found my response.<br>
      <br>
      And the third find was some riveting Dr. Dee's literature I don't
      dare to descend into, because I don't understand it and don't feel
      fond of that enough to read it all now (I have some more both
      comprehensible and reliable literature in my shelves) but I post
      the images that could lead somewhere:<br>

      That last one is something pythagorean, so it is here to look at
      it later or who knows<br>
      <br>
      then fourth book in the search was Agrippa, and it didn' ring no
      bell again, so it isn't here<br>
      the fifth was John (or Jean) Dee and before I looked into it, I
      expect it to bring something for me:<br>
      but it's the same book, yet a couple of images are in better
      quality:<br>

      Everybody heard of Agrippa, almost nobody among common public have
      heard of Dee.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">(don't believe the hype, aye)</font><br>
      The sixth find is again something of Agrippa and I realize how he
      is relevant: <br>
      he probably was the one, who popularized hebrew, and now I don't
      find it something special. it was.<br>
      All the other books I found that way seemed to be some
      nothingburger, just playing around hebrew alphabets, as those
      witch alphabet<a
        href="http://www.esotericarchives.com/fonts/index.html"><font
          color="#000000">s</font></a><font color="#000000"> <font
          color="#cccccc">(I don't find them authentic, so I don't feel
          like inserting them into this book, or else I'd have to
          collect all the other artistic artificial alphabets, which I
          will not)</font></font> <br>
      and here's a brightest example: they claim hebrew letters are the
      best (obvious propaganda) and yet they don't even notice that
      their chart is all out of order:<br>
      <a href="http://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/agripp1d.htm"><img
          src="V_files/table1.gif" alt="" border="0" width="593"
          height="949"></a><br>
      or amy I just an ignorant fool and this table wasn't supposed to
      tell מ is L and נ is M, but it could show how different cultures
      numerate those astrologic signs? (see Z &amp; F, those are greek
      and latin)<br>
      And in that book Agrippa touches the subject of three mothers, but
      in his book it's somewhat different from what Sefer Yetzirah
      tells:<br>
      <font size="+1">Of these, amongst the Hebrews, are three mothers,
        viz., [Alef, Vav, Yod] א, ו, י&nbsp; </font><font
        color="#cccccc"><font size="+1">seven double, viz. ב ג ד כ פ ר ת
          The other 12, viz. ה ז ח ט ל מ נ ס ע צ ק ר are simple. </font><br>
      </font>but they agree in the main feature of those letters, that
      it's vOwel, laBial, linGual<br>
      it could be that these beliefs come from the same source, because
      when there were only these three letters, they were both either
      and neither ו &amp; מ, or and nor (י &amp; ש (ת (and aleph
      probably was stated expicitly, or these two sources I have simply
      coincide in that one)<br>
      <br>
      I've decided to enter a image from Agrippa book I only mentioned:<br>
      <a href="http://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/agripp2b.htm"><img
          src="V_files/op2_p258L.jpeg" alt="" border="0" width="645"
          height="328"></a><br>
      because it made me thinking: not only have I never seen 10 as Δ, I
      also didn't think of 5 a of П, and it's fascinating how this
      labial reminds runic ᚢ which stands for V otherwise used for 5,
      and it aligns them in some other alphabetic sequence of ΙΠΔ <font
        color="#cccccc">(пять = 5)</font><br>
      which makes Agrippa even more reliable than Dee for me, I yet have
      to figure out if enochian alphabet is based or not: it begins with
      B reminding V and C reminding K, but the rest is way more messy,
      both in order and graphic.<br>
      They both are not respected by modern scientists, like those
      freaks I mentioned earlier, I wonder if they are destined to leave
      their own retarded traditions. They alrady did. Do I envy? I awe
      how they ever..<br>
      So here I look at what he tells further and it looks lame and gay
      how he writes 50 and 500 and Η four hundred could be unrecognized
      shortening for hundred (as M for mile) thus 50 and 500 are that
      very Π over 5 of what. M as 10000 kind of contradicts the other
      tradition, where it's 1000, but it relates to some other one, the
      chinese-japanese where 10000 is named san, so that M could be Ϻ,
      but my memory failed me, it's not san, but man: 万 (san is three:
      三) so it correlates it even more, or am I only trippin..<br>
      that X/M doesn't relate to roman numerals, because X is also a
      shortening for Χίλια (thousand)<br>
      П is not directly for пять, but for penta, πέντε, of course, and M
      could be for something greek too, but I haven't found what word
      that could be.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Academia doesn't allow this way of writing: when I say one thing,
      but then refute myself in thinking somewhat otherwise, but their
      rules are understood, but despised: they allow students to prove
      their words by referring to some book, as if books never lie (I
      won't go further explaining why it was made so and why it's bad,
      not in the mood to diss)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Another example of H standing for B: musical notation (hardly can
      it be a coincidence, somebody knew japanese or both he and
      japanese knew something else I yet to find out)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Did I know that fame destroys and maky faky so I made this work so
      toxic they yet have to extract the safe fruit out of it into their
      brochures?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      And I look at the way we cheer up greeks to shoot the rapefugies,
      and I understand the germans who wanted a total war.<br>

      Лицо краснеет когда гонишь от себя дурные мысли., когда мозг

      чуреки лезут в европу, они отсталые и до сих пор хотят войну, и мы
      все хотим войну, с кем поведёшься от того и наберёшься. Так это

      прибытие иноземцев заставляла аборигенов видеть гостей как
      пришельцев, как противников, чужие обычаи противны, иначе мы бы
      давно приняли их, стали бы одним народом, но мы разделены по
      причине личных (возможно генетически обусловленных) противоречий.
      итак, неприятие порождает неприятие, провоцирующее вооружённый

      want, hosts give the guests all the gibs they crave. Buy thir
      loyalties, send outside those who misbehave miss<font
        color="#cccccc"> mee </font>bee hive<br>
      When we're all scanned we can make misdoers personae non grata and
      forbid them from a city where their victim lives (as they did in
      greece exspelling criminals off the polis, but this punishment
      doesn't make much punishment when there are thousands of the
      cities like this one, so sending him out of the country will be
      needed? stronger borders would be needed<br>
      That's a crap solution, see, we need something else.<br>
      <br>
      And it's psychiatry's possibilities: if a person adapts some
      unusual social norms, he could be corrected in a facility or sent
      to country who wants him. and if nobody wants him? to keep him
      locked in a refugees camp? as in a labour camp? In a city that is
      closed as some special secret soviet town, but then their country
      of origin should share their land to such a city in their country
      of origin. It's only fair this way. What if nobody from Europe
      wants to live in sahara? those who do will have a bigger part.
      What if the citizens of the european country you exchange for some
      midleeastern shithole disagree with your polities? shit decision
      again. Look further, there must b a better way:<br>
      <br>
      Nobody cares who's who when we all live in autonomous underground
      capsules. <br>
      And those apes who live asurface will be in a whole new world, so
      trying to stop the chaotic movement is like preserving its
      previous state, trying to stop <font color="#cccccc">t</font>ime,
      but only stopping some processes to happen until you can't control
      them, it's an image in my head, as you border a part of a flow to
      make a lake or some stale shit, the flows are more awesome, so
      don't be affraid of them, change life so much that the old
      problems are irrelevant.<br>
      Support nazis, who will throw shitskins away before it's to late,
      but then be ready to stop the nutsies before they go messing with
      their legitimate neighbros, helping them to throw the shitskins
      away for example, but let's make it with propaganda showing
      advangates of those nazi polities. <br>
      <br>
      And those who sympathize the muzzzs, let them donate their charity

      Government still can be good, if it acts according to some
      hardcore statistically based science, open-source, ai, etc. Yet
      military power should stay in their baracks not subordinate to ai.
      Ai.go (artificial intelligence government) should be able to find
      peaceful ways, the solution of war should be handed (and
      explained) to humans and some the most peaceful ways to lead that
      war should be recommended.<br>

      The way I ended vol.2, that picture of Crowley leads to a thread

      It may seem that this book is satanic, but Jesus is the only demon
      I allowed to enter, because christian bible teaches this, and it's
      its positive value: it leads its readers to ibbur to prevent
      dibbuk.<br>
      The idea of Jesus being a Luciferian figure is hermetic, but
      probably was considered heretic too.<br>
      But we shouldn't forget who considers this, in whose grasp this
      world is according to that very bible.<br>

      Если воспринимать бога не как образ для поклонения, а как символ
      для обожения, то понятно происхождение мужских богов среди
      мужского населения, и понятны причины гомосексуализма среди
      обожающих мужиков собирающихся вместе. Более древние культы
      наверное не ограничивали присутствие женщин, но женщины отвлекают
      от настоящего обожения, но на него большинство племени неспособно,
      только на обожание, восхищение, и даже это если повезёт, прошедших
      через обожение обожествляли, они редкие ребята. мы редки<font

      Suddenly I realize my beef with Agrippa is that he placed yahweh
      into tetraktis, which tells me he didn't know what tetraktis was,
      that is why magicians are not recognized by scientists: they
      cannot distinguish their creative inventions from actual
      scientific revelations. I still don't know about Dr. Dee's
      enochian alphabet. The story of how they acquired that tells it's
      of their invention and shouldn't have been taken seriously.
      Compare it to how armanen runes were acquired according to their
      author (his word is not reliable enough to say it's authentic, but
      this research's proven them to be) read the parenthesis (a long
      word, but shorter than "what's in the brackets" and that's why
      russian has to change or go: when I write in paper, sometimes page
      ends before the long russian word ends, so I just shortened it by
      substituting all the russian suffixes with an english one. многа

      исследование безусловно много буков, но это не графомания, потому
      что всё это важно (я задавался вопросом "что такое графомания?"
      ведь моя проблема была в том, что меня ломало писать, что это за
      болезнь, при помощи которой можно зарабатывать - так я оставался в
      непонятке, пока не получил письмо от одного бывшего чиновника,
      которого пробило на откровенность и он начал присылать мне полотна
      текста о своём сыне, о машине, о всякой фигне, и я понял "а.. вон

      parentheisis tells that among other words I've confirmed the
      authentity of runic script commonly known as armanen, but I'm not
      sure about this name, so I call it Bornholm runes (armanen have
      different G, and that swastic G I haven't met elsewhere, so I
      recognize it as the difference between bornholm runes and armanen
      runes)<br>
      <img src="V_files/armanen_runes.png" alt="" width="512"
        height="512"><br>
      <br>
      As you can see, you can compare them all to the alphabetic runes
      of bornholm, <br>
      except G, which is the only dotted letter in bornholm stone. and
      that stone doesn't have C, thus this G thing could also be caused
      by K column trying to break through. It's a weird letter, yet to
      be understood.<br>
      <img src="img/030.png" alt="" width="684" height="493"><br>
      <br>
      Now I see that armanen runes are in their aettir, so I want to
      colour the stone with those aettir,<br>
      but it returned no symmetry, pure random chaos, in case you'd like
      to see it, I'll publish the negative results, as many theorists of
      science tell academia should:<br>
      <img src="V_files/030aettired.png" alt="" width="684" height="493"><br>
      So it made me think tht Bureus is like those magicians invented
      things he thought he's discovered.<br>
      But then I realize Bureus separated those aettir differently:<br>
      <a
href="https://gangleri.nl/articles/44/the-rune-cross-of-johannes-bureus/"><img
          src="V_files/bureusfuthark.gif" alt="" border="0" width="530"
          height="159"></a><br>
      I had to walk this road at least to see this interesting numeral
      system <br>
      <font color="#999999">(I'll yet research if it's authentic, but
        click the image, it goes deeper)</font><br>
      so I'll repaint it differently:<br>
      <img src="V_files/030aettired..png" alt="" width="684"
        height="493"><br>
      and still nothing.<br>
      But Bureus builds some other symmetries, but I suspect a hairy paw
      of Vatican in this one:<br>
      <img src="V_files/200px-Runa_ABC.jpg" alt="" width="200"
        height="329"><img src="V_files/bureusrunecross.jpg" alt=""
        width="202" height="266"><img src="V_files/lapisbureus.GIF"
        alt="" width="233" height="263"><br>
      <br>
      But that linked image leads to where it's said that Bureus used
      numerology to tie runes to the christian date of him "inventing"
      those runes:<br>
      <a
href="https://gangleri.nl/articles/44/the-rune-cross-of-johannes-bureus/"><img
          src="V_files/bureusnumbercross.gif" alt="" border="0"
          width="309" height="201"></a><br>
      Once again a christian authority claims to author nation's trea<font
        color="#999999">th</font>ure.<br>
      But it's more like he invented this cross, for which he could also
      change the graphical part of some runes to make them lay into the
      symmetry:<br>
      <font size="+1">All of the letters of Bureus’ futhark can be found
        in the rune-cross, so also all the numbers can be found in it,
        as you can see below. The total of the cross comes to 2775, I
        don’t think this number has any special significance. A few
        things are that the right (for the viewer left) arm of the cross
        counts up to 366 or a year in the complete cycle of the sun, the
        left arm 794 which according to Bureus is the number of years
        between the conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn. Leaving out the
        K-rune, the vertical beam counts 1605, the year in which Bureus
        <i>invented</i> his runes. As you can see, you can make anything
        out of a figure like this. Bureus used a lot of number symbology
        in his writings, so it is not unlikely that he did they same
        with his cross, but this is about as far as I know of meanings.
        and the rest I didn't read</font><br>
      Or was it a way for him to preserve this writing system? I should
      be careful with my remarks.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      But I have to apply that retransliteration of futhark to see what
      those aettir are.<br>

      How jews could be associated with thieves? Воры иногда меняют
      внешний вид: ты не можешь сделать нос маленьким, но ты можешь
      сделать накладной нос. дёсны будут как у многих евреев от рождения
      если вставить в рот вставные зубы, т.о. многих евреев заметали по
      ошибке, или обвиняли по ошибке, используя словесный портрет от
      очевидца. Как в одной голливудской комедии словесный партрет
      рисовал кого-то с картин пикассо, и именно такого поймали на фоне
      совсем другого эпизода.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      the words jews and thieves are somewhat similar: some weird
      lingual and a labials<br>
      in russian they are also similar: евреи и воры, consonants are
      exactly the same.<br>
      <br>
      Но могут быть и другие факторы, и я не уверен что воры
      гримируются, актёры имеют право законно иметь гримёрный набор. он
      должен играть такого где-то, чтоб профессиоалы <br>

      another by associative links of misheard) then I would also
      compare women to witches, the same w I believe.<br>

      <font color="#cccccc">a guy I knew passed away (yet I don't know
        how) he shared a couple of ideas before he went: a teleporter,
        which was just a telephone booth, which yould let you see the
        other city of your choice, in that city would stand another
        booth - that was his weird idea the way I understood it, but
        what is much more interesting is where it led me: you can make
        it not some booth, but from home, and you can attach it in that
        other city not to some static booth or even pole (or many poles
        would do too) but to a drone in a form of a fly the tynier you
        can make it the longer it can stay unnoticed. I don't know if
        smal things can travel fast. Probably some bigger drone should
        be used to transport it. In a form of a bird, for example. <br>
        another idea was even weirder than that, he said you place
        plastic film on the ends of a barrel, and you pump out the air,
        so the film concave, and thus you have a plastic lens. I told
        him the laws of optic will see this film as two planes breaking
        the space in three parts without much of magnification. He had
        nothing to counter-argue, but it made me think what if we fill
        it with water? And what if we remove plastic, and use some
        transparent gas of high pressure from both ends of that water?
        wouldn't it concave with atomary precision?<br>
        I don't feel like I may patent it (though it's such things bring
        people fortunes) so I will share it on 4chan soon after I upload
        it on github, so it happens on two independent platforms, so I
        can prove that it was in public domain with a higher
        probability.<br>
        I don't feel like I should patent it for many reasons, and that
        it belongs to the guy I didn't even like or value (too bad, I'm
        ashamed, he could have more, I had nothing to do with it, but I
        could value him more. I should have shared the way I extended
        his revvelations with him, but he really pissed me off, but it
        was immature of me to be mad, I should have become a more of a
        friend to him)<br>

      I stared at this image in the context of A(XH)(CS)ИМСЗ and I saw
      it beginning from A and going to Z in a very specific manner: I
      didn't see C, I saw S, because that's the russian С. And it just
      jumped from the first column into the fourth whether to H or X.
      And what I actually saw first was the fifth column, which included
      YMS, the three mothers I conceptualized as the abbreviation of my
      band: ИМС where З is 3 and it's that other band A works with after
      X&amp;S dropped off (S even worked with that second band together
      with A) but I didn't think of them.<br>
      And before I saw иМС in that column I first saw Y &amp; M being
      the exceptions and one aboue the other and then I saw that S
      probably used to be written as Ϻ and it's still Σ in greek. <br>
      So I wasn't looking for it there, it came to me itself and for the
      other time this band's name returns into this book, whether to
      show hou much it all can be an apopheny or to show how mystic is
      actually true in magicians' lives.<br>
      And it goes further with it's З, because it's that very Z in the
      end, but I wrote about int before.<br>
      And like genetif code this septagrammaton can also be read
      differently: so that second состав didn't know what I know and
      they just named their new старуха with the final trigrammaton MCЗ
      also stands for the guy who came instead of Старуха Изергиль. and
      if А is still Alex and И is still Игорь, then in that compound
      Tanya Voyna is whether X as she was initially presented as another
      Xenya, Katarakta was the nickname, which made those other three
      KKK, KataraktaKonstantinovKulakov, and now when Konstantinov left
      (even before that) she's Tanya Voyna, which is TV, the final
      letters in a way. And that V is the labial she had to be if she
      came instead of Х(B) <br>

          in their pilpul, but to strike it at the heart - is it
          refutable? <font color="#cccccc">(I try to avoid the term
            falsifiable, because it could be understood wrongly, but I
            may be wrong myself on that one too)</font><br>
          and <br>
          <font size="+1">&gt; Detailed measurements of the expansion
            rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8
            billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the
            universe.<br>
            &gt; The galaxy MACS0647-JD (inset) appears very young and
            is only a fraction of the size of our own Milky Way. The
            galaxy is about 13.3 billion light-years from Earth, the
            farthest galaxy yet known, and formed 420 million years
            after the Big Bang.</font><br>
          But they already prepare ground for recalibration of their
          irrefutable theory by promoting the idea of the universe
          expanding faster than light.<br>

      Let me hit the(ir) edducation system instead: I taught a kid to
      learn in one lesson: after the classes I took the money from a
      coffy table and told him: see, your mother is ready to speand on
      yout study, so if you studies yourself you could hav ethis money.
      But wageslave teachers cannot teach like this, or they will have
      no wage.<br>
      So it's another reason why the best way to learn is to learn for
      free. You're free to donate to a teacher. But it's smarter to pay

      What that etruscan canon tells is that letters fro A to I could
      all be vowels:<br>
      the middle form of alleged H is strokingly between A &amp; E, the
      other two can be double E's<br>
      alleged TH (T) can be O or be related to I written as T on those
      clocks where it could be easily fixed if that was but and not
      feature.<br>
      And K begins the sequence of consonants as it does in eastern
      alphabets and syllabaries.<br>
      <br>
      I woke up with my eyes closed after a bright dream with
      beyonce-like nigerette singing some modern pop with an
      accompanient of one short sample repeated fast and changing its
      tone for melody and two niggers in the audience were dancing by
      sitting lower and lower to шпагат as if it was a contest or a
      challenge, a duel, and then he who was the offender sat two deep
      and tore apart. and the defender (the one who was challenged by
      the offender) was only half-torn and that was that his legs were
      lying on the floor, but he could move along by moving them across
      the floor. <br>
      And so I woke up and decided not to open my eyes, but to smoke
      some weed if I can find it, which I did, and I went to bath with
      my eyes closed and there I made that высь &amp; низ session, and I
      thought about how did people keep information before writing. And
      poems and songs was the answer. And I tried to write about высь
      (upwards) &amp; низ (downwards) выше и ниже, v &amp; ν, both are
      ends: v in archaic roman and in runes, and n is in the half of the
      alphabet:<br>
      a b c d&nbsp; e f g h i j kl m n<br>
      o p q r&nbsp; s&nbsp; t u v w&nbsp; x&nbsp; y&nbsp; z<br>
      here w reflects ij<br>
      here y reflects m<br>
      and M reflects W<br>
      here x is another double letter<br>
      thus it reflects kl and thus l ~ s, for l ~ c ~ s<br>
      In russian first half of the alphabet is voiced, and that could be
      what B represents<br>
      in russian last half of the alphabet is voiceless, and that could
      be what T represents.<br>
      And if it's an universal pattern, we can see the letters added
      later.<br>
      And we begin with greek, because all its first row is voiced, and
      that's the link with russian:<br>

      </font> here vowels are black, voiced are red, voiceless are blue,
      and it seems nobody but russians care about this division, evern
      georgian, which saved lineal and axial symmetries thoroughly
      didn't seem to care about preserving voiced-voiceless structures
      when it added many lingual to its end.<br>
      let's try it with the other two:<br>

        red even though I consider it vowel, but it is voiced (as any
        vowel, duh)</font><br>
      And we see that where russians only have k, other europeans also
      have whether H or Θ<br>
      (though those who have Θ also had H as a voiceless, even though in
      runic form it's ᚼ<font color="#cccccc">(or ᛡ)</font> which exactly
      repeats russian Ж which stands exactly there, or before Z which
      was probably there when θ was the f. <font color="#666666">or Ж
        and З are invariants (Ж is transliterated as whether J or ZH (З
        is Z))</font><br>
      And suddenly I realize that italian doesn't have K <font
        color="#cccccc">(but they do have H, and in my notebooks I
        theorized that h k R are three forms of the same something)</font><br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_orthography"><img

      and though it tells that jkwxy are part of the alphabet, it seems
      they are not:<br>

      <br>
      A B <font color="#3333ff">C</font> D E F G H I L M N O P Q R S T
      U V Z<br>
      But all the alphabet descending from latin have this C (which all
      the others: greeks, russians, jews, arabs, recognize it as a
      voiced letter, and runic alphabet doesn't include it at all. And
      here it's obvious that ᚦ is a voiced letter, ð,<font
        color="#cccccc"> just as Δ is,</font> even though it's told that
      it's representing [θ] or [ð]<br>
      whispering ᚦ is θ alright. And another revelation I had today is
      that if velars began the language, it could be because the most
      quiet letter you can pronounce is soft k, and thus whispering is
      rational thought, unlike scream. And what caused this revelation
      is me walking around with eyes closed being rather high and I saw
      the alphabet in an unusual way it was<br>
      A Г..<br>
      Е..<br>
      ..<br>
      this angle of it, and I saw that it actually was<br>
      A<font color="#c0c0c0">Б</font>Г..<br>
      Е..<br>
      ..<br>
      where Б was a form of Г, thus it's not с from b, but b from c? can
      I even trust that vision?<br>
      Г as the first consonant would arrange european alphabet along
      with the indian ones.<br>
      and in japanese it's Ba(バ) being the form of Ha(ハ), not the other
      way around.<br>
      or is it the other way around? is it voiced form the more
      primitive than the whispering ones?<br>
      because runic alphabet knows ABD, but not C. But what if ᚦ is c?
      because ᚲ looks pretty much like it's staveless form. And ᛒ could
      be the double form of ᚦ and then Б is a derivative of Г<br>
      and if Г is ᚦ it refers to Р(r) even more then by phonetic an the
      graphic side of r &amp; г, and thus q &amp; Р<font color="#cccccc">(R)</font>
      are even more relative, just as the halves of the alphabet. Those
      halves worked so well together in english form of latin, lets look
      at them again, and let's try it again, and let's also do it with
      italian (because I like its way of saying Z is whether [ds] or
      [ts] thus ts it is, just as ц and צ and ת actuallly, and just as v
      is f in german.<br>

      And we just found where M is the Middle letter. in italian it is.<br>
      but i don't see much of resemblance between these halves.<br>

      A B C D E F G H I J KL M N<br>
      O P Q R S T U V W&nbsp; X&nbsp;&nbsp; Y&nbsp; Z <br>
      I read that C used to be read as G, thus voiced form here IS the
      original one. But that I read, it doesn't make it automatically
      true. but it allows us to suggest that those halves could be
      voiced and voiceless counterparts, then it demands rearrangement
      so not only f reflects t, but, well, I changed my mind already,
      but lets' see what I wanted to see::<br>

      stuff, my brains demands sugars (even gthough I read it's glucose
      that's safe one, but they only sell fructose which is poisonous,
      so I heard)<br>
      let's make this mess with italian just in case:<br>

      and I'm not sure about R, because it doesn't have a voiceless

        Although strongly associated, indeed often referred to as the
        “Celtic Tree Alphabet”, Ogham is a distinct medieval tradition
        that uses the names of trees to denote its individual letters in
        a written alphabet. Since Ogham of itself covers neither the
        mythology nor botanical lore of trees, it is better understood
        as an ‘add-on’ to the subject of the tree alphabet, and not as
        an explanation or umbrella to it.<br>
        The Irish og-úaim (‘point-seam’), refers to the ridge or groove
        made by the point of a sharp weapon, which explains the
        technique, however it is traditionally credited as having been
        invented by Ogma, the patron of poetry and eloquence, and one of
        the three key gods of the Tuatha de Danaan (along with Lug and
        the Dagda). Ogma’s first message was written as seven b’s on a
        birch tree, a warning to Lug Lamfhota that “your wife will be
        carried away seven times to the otherworld unless the birch
        protects her”. Strictly therefore, the word ogham refers only to
        the form of letters or script, while the letters themselves are
        known collectively as the Beith-luis-nin after the letter names
        of the first letters (as ‘alphabet’ refers to Alpha and Beta in
        the greek alphabet). Because the word nin (as opposed to nuin)
        literally means ‘a forked branch’, Beith-luis-nin can be assumed
        to mean the ‘forked-branch’ style of written letters, or simply
        the ‘Beith-luis letters’. The ogham alphabet originally

      I like how ᚦ and ᛒ are at the opposite sides, and how ᚿ is in the

      would scream of the obvious similarities. M &amp; N are

      Too my surprise, everything but ᛘ and ᚓ correlates. At first I
      didn't know what to do with ᚦ until I saw d in ogham, I would
      equalize R to Q, but let's leave it laying uncoloured, because I'm
      not sure if it isn't within statistical expectation.<br>

      will can in russian is сможешь. can is можешь. it's interesting
      how russian verbs get into future forms with the help of prefixes:
      бьёшь, но убьёшь, едешь, но уедешь, even though in these examples
      у cand stand for away, but it could be relative to dutch ge-,
      because dutch -g is english -y: dag &amp; weg are day &amp; way.
      с- is another prefix to make future or совершённую форму, and c-
      isnot htat far from ge-<br>
      ем, но съем, еду, но съеду, заеду, за- ещё один префикс подобного
      рода. приеду, отъеду is future, but отъезжаю is present, where
      that longer suffix is similar to -ing. actually in seems every
      prefix turns russian present simple verb of present into future
      form<br>

      divide a pie in five pieces this way that there are exactly the
      same distance between the cuts and the ends of the pie, what will
      be the size of those pieces, and what would be the voume if it was
      a ball.<br>
      here's a previous task: what if we cut the ball in half, and then
      cut those halves in unequal halves by the same method (the same
      distance between previous cut and the end of the ball or a disc)<br>

      Why would it be so, that right triangle with sides 3 and 4 had

      Understanding that would probably lead to simple understanding of

      also understand why 3<sup>3</sup>+4<sup>3</sup>+5<sup>3</sup>=6<sup>3</sup><br>

        title="Aa1 [x]" alt="x" height="18"> tasks immediately demand
      some complex geometry. There are formulas of chords, but my task
      here is to find them myself, and to show you whow we do it.<br>
      It would be easier if some of those lines were of the inscribed
      square, but if it's diagonal equals D, not a single side of it can
      be the fraction of it. because pythagoras theorem declares, that
      2a<sup>2</sup>=D<sup>2</sup>, thus a thus a deminishes D in
      irrational number of √2<br>
      &nbsp;and that exact number relates to post-pythagorean proof of
      irratinal numbers being neither even nor odd or something like
      that. I didn't understand that proof, so I left if for some later
      times when I whether find a better version of it, or when I
      augment my intellect. For now I would say that they began breaking
      th math when they introduced the irrational numbers, or even
      before thant, but I worked with irrational numbers (not the
      fractions they appear out of, or they appear not from fractions
      but from roots) so I found them at least convenient (but I never
      used them in real life maybe, or I somehow know 1.4 as something
      similar to √2 so I guess I did.<br>
      That proof that √2 cannot be seen as a fraction is something I yet
      have to understand and how did they make it by showing that it's
      neither odd nor even? can fraction be odd or even? 2/3 = two 1/3s?
      I seriously doubt you can play this way, because 1/3 = 2 1/6s. is
      6 what make that 2 non valid? so 1/3 is an odd fraction and 1/2 is
      en even fraction? or only 2/3 is? 2/4 is not a fraction it's 1/2.
      what is 3/5? ultra odd? 4/5 is even? okay, let's suppose such
      thing ass odd or even fraction exists, let's try to see how it
      looks:<br>
      evens: 2/3, 2/5, 4/5, 2/7, 4/7, 6/7 <br>
      odds: 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/7, 3/4, 3/5, 3/7, 5/6, 5/7<br>
      it is as if there are twice as many odd fractions than there are
      even ones.<br>
      but 1/3 can be seen as two 1/6's, so this whole idea of odd and
      even fractions is rather shaky, so I have to research it further
      if that idea ever existed or merely a product of my imagination.<br>
      Well, I guess it's not just my imagination, they actually do:<br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">A proof that the square root of 2 is irrational<br>
        <br>
        Let's suppose √2 is a rational number. Then we can write it
        √2&nbsp; = a/b where a, b are whole numbers, b not zero.<br>
        <br>
        We additionally assume that this a/b is simplified to lowest
        terms, since that can obviously be done with any fraction.
        Notice that in order for a/b to be in simplest terms, both of a
        and b cannot be even. One or both must be odd. Otherwise, we
        could simplify a/b further.<br>
        <br>
        From the equality √2&nbsp; = a/b it follows that 2 = a<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup>,&nbsp;



        or&nbsp; a<sup>2</sup> = 2 · b<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp; So the square
        of a is an even number since it is two times something.<br>
        <br>
        From this we know that a itself is also an even number. Why?
        Because it can't be odd; if a itself was odd, then a · a would
        be odd too. Odd number times odd number is always odd. Check it
        if you don't believe me!<br>
        <br>
        Okay, if a itself is an even number, then a is 2 times some
        other whole number. In symbols, a = 2k where k is this other
        number. We don't need to know what k is; it won't matter. Soon
        comes the contradiction.<br>
        <br>
        If we substitute a = 2k into the original equation 2 = a<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup>,
        this is what we get:<br>
        2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2k)<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup><br>
        2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4k<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup><br>
        2*b<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4k<sup>2</sup><br>
        b<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2k<sup>2</sup><br>
        <br>
        This means that b<sup>2</sup> is even, from which follows again
        that b itself is even. And that is a contradiction!!!<br>
        <br>
        WHY is that a contradiction? Because we started the whole
        process assuming that a/b was simplified to lowest terms, and
        now it turns out that a and b both would be even. We ended at a
        contradiction; thus our original assumption (that √2 is
        rational) is not correct. Therefore √2 cannot be rational<a

      <br>
      This time I understood it, and I'm not sure they said that
      fraction were even, but the numbers in those fractions are even or
      odd, not the fraction itself. Here I leave this pondering to show
      you how good brains should work. I found that I just was wrong, or
      I just named fractions odd or even which oesn't make sense. or
      have I been proving that I'm also wrong when I tell I'm wrong?
      Thats not how it should work to prove that thus you werre right,
      admit being wrong, live with it a little, then you can play the
      other part, that will help you grow by seeing different
      perspectives, as I tend to believe in god from time to time,
      bringing new arguments to accept it: to contradict the commies, to
      see what it will look like if I'm wrong on that one, to see how
      those who invented tha alphabets did. and after years of living
      those beliefs, to find new arguments to disbelieve again: it
      doesn't make much sense and religious people are fags, it drives
      me crazy but religious people are based, and I'm actually still
      waiting for the third reason to fall out of it when I found some
      events, only easiliy explained by the spiritual realm (literally
      AXC) so I've got the fourth reason to believe, after I began
      fading out of faith by reasoning of who gives a fuck about these
      letters, delve into biotech instead, you're using your powers

      I believe I've already spoken in this book on who invented ti note
      and when (but still not why) but for whatever reason I couldn't
      find it, so I have to return to this research once more: <br>
      Solfège is, like alphbet, is named on the basis of two consequent
      letters of its sistem:<br>
      <font size="+1">In music, solfège (UK: /ˈsɒlfɛdʒ/,[1] US:
        /sɒlˈfɛʒ/; French: [sɔlfɛʒ]) or solfeggio (/sɒlˈfɛdʒioʊ/;
        Italian: [solˈfeddʒo]), also called sol-fa, solfa, solfeo, among
        many names</font> <br>
      but why would they name it from the middle, the modern
      letter-notation also goes from the middle, A is that very la, so
      whoever named the system sol-fa probably used some mode beginning
      with even more previous key.<br>
      <font size="+1">Through the Renaissance (and much later in some
        shapenote publications) various interlocking 4, 5 and 6-note
        systems were employed to cover the octave. </font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      That fact that I couldn't find a piece I wrote and it demands some
      other form of the book. It's way too big to be just one book. I
      will split it into form of several cross-linked blocks, and maybe
      that will one day be<font color="#006600">come</font> a standart.
      These volumes are also cross-linked, but they strut<font

      consequently, new blocks should be ingrained into the old parts,
      it should go fractally in a net of those green links.<br>
