      one(?) to five(?) semantic meanings it can take in different
      words, dare I say, correct? That was a good classification of
      language by semantics, it was an awesome work I read in the 90s I
      think, though I put it away when he began building his lexics,
      because I wanted to make it myself, independently, so I could
      compare my findings to his dictionary. And now it seems I can do

      With these two raw aſf but neverthe less dictionaries to what
      kessler theorized and thus to Kessler<a
        href="mirrors/Ya_A_Kesler_Azbuka_i_russko-evropeyskiy_slovar.pdf"><font
          color="#000000">'</font></a>s:.<br>
      but no, let some ai (artificial or augmented intelligence) does it
      afterwards, because I tried to find алый in his Ъ groups, and I
      couldn't find it. I would place it whether in Ъ6 next to fire
      (look at the very end of the book to see his rationalization of
      fire being with Я) or to Ъ18 next to ярый (яркий, эти группы
      связаны и не понятно умышленно или случайно, и не известно что
      страшней, ууууу)<br>
      <br>
      so I put a mirror to his book at that previous ' in case the link
      in the one before it dies, because it's an outstanding work,
      whether it is correct or not, and it would be a bummer if it's
      lost, because it could be the biggest loss in that Fomenko
      scandal, when some historic works were made by mathematician and
      published in the most prominent soviet university and later
      historic department labelled them as pseudoscientific (look who's
      talking!) but failing to attach any constructive criticism to his
      work for at least three years (I was watching that situation
      closely) maybe even five (so long ago it was, that my memory is
      not sure about this digit in it) and only after let's say 3 to 5
      years an engineer or a mathematician (memory also doubts what
      version is true) began public intellectual battle with Fomenko,
      and I wasn't able to follow their conversation, because whether
      their argumentations required some level of competence I didn't
      feel like achieving educating myself, or just the interest to this
      situation faded with time, because what the situation taught me is
      that fuck academia, those clerks don't know shit, so I was
      liberated to begin my work from scratch without leaning onto the
      academia speers. And the same rationalization could be beyond
      Kessler's attempt to group all the dictionary into lesser semantic
      groups without bringing reconstructed forms and structures made
      before them (they can always be wrong, and me personally, I don't
      believe in established language families, because of how russian
      and japanese are similar. If I want to preserve the family
      structure which is wide accepted today, I should attach japanese
      to slavic languages, but it would be so insane and actually why
      not to combine chinese to english because of some similarities? wo
      &amp; we and short words and simple grammar, that probably were
      the two huge branches we initially were on, but cross-culture
      communications made russian drift further from japanese and closer
      to english, just as japanese drifted towards chinese, so it's not
      a tree, but a jar or aminoacids the way I imagine it.<br>
      But after saying all that I decide to not dig into his theory
      until I develop my own dictionary and let it be better than his,
      with much less semantic clasters.<br>
      I dare to mention Fomenko more and more explicitly in these texts
      probably because I grew more hostile towards academia, but also
      because a friend of mine mentioned him as a freak not worth
      mentioning and I asked him why exactly doesn't he like what he
      said, and I couldn't receive a coherent answer to that, he simply
      accepted that academia is always right. Even though history of
      science here and again prove otherwise.<br>
      So about the freaks, we should distinguish between them: there are
      obvious freaks like Chudinov who's probably there to smear some
      authentic artifacts like that Bornholm alphabet runestone; then
      there are those freaks who are whether fools or trolls like
      Oreshkin; then there are some clinically insane freaks like
      Lukashevich. Those evaluations are purely subjective, but they
      allow to understand where I stand.<br>
      The other group of linguistic freaks are Vashkevich and Dragunkin,
      who pull some outrageous conclusions out of their observations,
      but the observations itself may be rather useful for those who
      learn foreign languages (Vashkevich compare arabic words to greek,
      russian and whatever else, I didn't even read him. Dragunkin
      compares russian to japanese and to english. All that can be
      incredibly useful as mnemonic tools) <br>
      Fomenko also belongs to that second group of semi-correct
      scientific marginals, and the most prominent reason of his
      theories not being taken serious (I'm not even talking of them
      being accepted) is that he doesn't have historian education. But
      seriously, if prominent mathematicians use some previously
      published tools and models to the structure of historic data, that
      alone demands a proper outlook from scientific society, which
      didn't happen when he was relatively alright, and now there's even
      less chance of that being done properly, for that guy whether went
      trolling or was sold out or whatver happened to him, that the
      level of his scientific thought dropped from mathematical
      modelling to mere speculations. Or it could be because it's easier
      to notice what is wrong with the state of affair happening at the
      moment, but one has ever-growing tendency to fall short when (s)he
      tries to describe as it was or what's supposed to be done in the
      future. Me myself, I'm definitely in that second group of freaks,
      and some of my assumptions are probably dead wrong, but those main
      elements of this theory the structures and some other findings may
      persist and sustain. And I actually except some academic
      recognition in the following three years or so. Even though I was
      recently told that <font size="+1">Ignaz Semmelweis was
        disregarded for awhile because MDs are psychopaths: see
        Semmelweis effect. Gregor Mendel's founding of genetics was
        completely ignored for thirty something years </font>I began
      that path believing that anything can be achieved in mere ten
      years, also they say history goes faster than before, so I expect
      it to take society ten years to recognize what it's all about. And
      it's been over six years now since I went public, so..<br>
