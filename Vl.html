      and I think there was some youtube guru teaching foreign accents
      focusing solely on consonants and thus missing the point not being
      very good at foreign accents himself, even though he practiced not
      only what he preached, but unconsciously changing his vocalism to
      mimic the accent he didn't understood but somehow felt (or rather
      heard) but it probably was somewhere else, you'll find such
      examples yourself, because it being about vowels is still an
      unorthodox thought, even though it is correct.<br>

      забавно, что Алиестера Кроули ни там ни на вики не упомянают.<br>
      <br>
      scientists (the true scientist, those who look for the truth)
      disrespect magicians as some retards or crooks. and they're
      correct about it most of the time. Some magicians are actually
      scientists, but level of scientific thought of Aliester was found
      by me rather law, and allow me to demonstrate why: he describes
      how he and his friend invoked some demon to help his friend go to
      India. And they thought the invocation failed, but rather soon his
      friend found an opportunity to go to India with some ship. It
      convinced Aliester that spirit doesn't have to show himself or
      herself or itself <font color="#cccccc">to</font> oniself,
      themself, to magicians to grant their wish: maybe human sacrifices
      could make some spirit appear to try to make them stop: hindus say
      or buddhists say, I dont recognize usually who of them said what,
      that sufferings are self-inflicted by magi to make their wishes
      granted, but I think it grows from искусство требует жретв thing.
      жрецов? if I typoes жертв as жретв, то <font color="#cccccc">цре..
      </font>жрецов недалеко, вернее ещё ближе.<br>
      Я накурен как исследователю духов и положено быть, но я не уверен
      что я не копаюсь в своей голове сейчас, вернее в шее, ощущения
      идут от щеи, которую мы&nbsp; другом обрабатывали RSO в
      недостаточных количествах, что согласно одному исследованию может
      привести к распространению онкопроцессов, мы обрабатывали
      папилому, и я её пытаясь оторвать как резинкой запустил что-то от
      неё вовнутрь, я боюсь. Don't fuck with aliester, that's what they
      try to tell you. Whatever he did is not for everybody, the
      knowledge of sacrifices are not even in his book as far as I could
      see, some mentionings of that, yes, but don't I do the same? don't
      I mention this scary shit? This book is to be stoopeed right here
      and neer shown. Or this tabooed topic should resolve into as I
      caoll them plot-twist. Yes, we knw of all those deviations from
      healthy societal processes, btu <br>
      You knew people ate other people not only for survival, but often
      just for the hell of it: it didn't make you go and try it. <font

      get ya for that, they don't evin care sometimes: we have tens of

      lead to ear reminding year: could it be crescent standing for a
      week, now standing for a month most of the time, even though a
      month is four different crescents: week = ухо? I don't know, but
      they're somewhat similar. I want my heat to held and body wiggled
      in amiotic liquid so my neck relaxes completely. But what if it
      will tear a muscle or two? how strongly or accurately are you
      supposed to wiggle your body and why. Just hold your head and let
      your body move freely. Now I just found a way of extracorporal
      stimulation of heart function by just rocking the capsule with
      embryonized man without placenta. <br>
      When placenta is on (or in) we have to work with placenta, just as
      woman probably pumps it with her lungs.<br>
      but I was speaking of cannibalism: I would be grossed out from
      eating most of the people, and to my surprise I notice that pretty
      women are preferrable: is it why cannibal societies are ugly like
      hell? children are also preferable, and not black child, they seem
      more dirty, but the whiter and prettier child is the more
      appealling it seem to be eaten <font color="#999999">(I know

      So white world is in some better hands, we try to have some good
      things and even though we (europeans) had our own autodaf***s and
      now it seems enemies opened the gates. Some jews seem to believe
      in their own myths and that is only natural that such jews want to
      take a revenge. Why did jews revolt? Because we didn't give them
      Jerusalem when we had it. We could expell all the arabs (and then
      we would be the bad guys) so we gave it to them to do the job, and
      oh they're doing. Arabs to arabia? What about palestinian arabs?
      They're palestinians? Some of them consider themselves
      palestinians and not arabs the same way I consider myself cyberian
      and not russian. Until Cyberia is in better hands, I will be
      considered russian by everyone around me. Even if Japan takes over
      (never gonna happen, not this far, we better don't blow this
      structure, because we'll have to fight for our right to be free
      from the fuckers of all sorts. Russian gangsters will openly take
      over and will become colonels and such, but military people are
      crazy. Do you think there are no crazies among gangsters? Who do I
      write it for? For myself first of all. Will I ever read it? When I
      have augmented intelligence and want to have a copy of 2020 me, I

        a future form. You because imperative speaks about future?

      But yea back to crowley and scientists: for them it would be
      classical apophenia and person building theories upon such a not
      only anecdotal, but outright weak evidence cannot be considered
      scientist. But are they right? The guy practiced magick
      successfully but isn't it all just magic? "spirits could be shouwn
      to ignorant audience in a smoke if a glass with a figurine of the
      spirit be placed before the only source of light in the dark room
      lighted only with the source of the smoke. And if the source is
      fire-less or fire is hidden, the impression could be incredibly
      bright. It's just my guess, I need to make an experiment to tell.
      Today public are more sofisticated and thus magic is placed under
      the k of knowledge of some abstract speculations and accidents are
      turned into miracles and some psychological element to it all is
      also present: imagine how bold is someone who overstepped the
      strongest taboos: a fighter tells me that your scream is different
      after you've beaten someone. Thanks for this forbidden knowledge,
      oh fighter, but I had to tell you off for some political reasons.

      I think I just reinvented крёстное знамение: прикоснувшись
      пальцами ко лбу, к сердцу, к левому плечу, правому плечу <font
        color="#999999">(плечо потому что на нём плачат? но когда
        крестился, думал о том что это руки) </font>и заметил, что

      органично это вышло, как никогда не <font color="#cccccc">уы</font>было

      это, вес был на правой руке чуть больше, но ведь и раньше заметил,
      что левая рука у сердца, зачем бы надевали кольцо на левую руку,
      если не была она священней, правая с разумом, левая с сердцем.
      Православные прямо в названии объявляют свою особенность
      орто-доксы орто скорей всего тоже of right словно до них делали по
      другому, и это сочетается с тем, что византийская империя, хоть и
      держала звание Рима дольше, "и тем трудней чем дольше" – это от
      недостатка фантазии у них же, всё за старое цеплялись. К тому что
      если эта христианская магия работает, то в странах под
      предводительством протестантов оно работает лучше всего, знать они
      правильно молятся. У католиков чуть похуже (папа и вся эта
      пиздабратия коррупционная, всё о власти миркой пекутся при том что
      мир во власти сатаны и кто они держащие власть в этом мире) у
      православных вообще всё швах. хуже только у муслимов, у которых
      где-то вровень с коммунистами, в Афганистане были и те и другие,
      разница не знаю, может им заметней чем со стороны. Если кто
      думает, что это вопрос дискуссионный, люди голосуют ногами
      однозначно в сторону протестантско-католических стран. Причины
      объяснять на этих страницах смысла нет: те кто не видят сами не
      читают подобные текста.<br>

      Left hand being more magical could explain muslimic tradition of
      not raising left hand: you have to greet friends with your right
      hand, keep the left hand for yourself: in islam you're supposed to
      wipe your arse with it. They take magic more seriously, they're
      more archaic (in reflection of Byzantine, but they're even further
      in the past) Sun comes every day, seasons come every year, to
      count longer periods, it seems natural to refer to some event as
      the reign of some king, as the event the most of laws depend on.
      As they did before mochamad in russian mocha is urine, that is
      where they immediately fail with russic nations, even though it's
      not obvious even to russic nations themselves, because they call
      mochammed mohamed (not ch, h, the same way englishmen pronounce
      it. Could english orthography be the bant working via russian?<br>
      But I came here to ask Could islam be made what it is today by
      english intelligence of Lourence for what you cannot stop lead.
      You cannot leave process in the neighbouring countries go by
      itself. Who know where it can lead them. May them work in
      accordance to our goals. The common goals, let us be the deciders
      of the fates. Who we? Those who speak english. But we all think
      differently and we all lead different ways. So be it, we have the
      advantage before those who don't: we have access to tens more of
      information they do. It gives unearned advantage to common public
      of brittich commonwealth. Just as latin gave such advantage to
      italians. Let's see how brits lead this world better than romani
      ever could. Gipsies pretend to be of both, Rome and Aegyptos. Big
      deal, евреи are of europe. Where are you from? I'm from here,
      there, everywhere. <br>
      Now I act as an asshole giving them shit. I'm sorry, I will learn

      При очередной молнии почувствовал её аж в пальцах левой ноги,
      пошёл поклониться: открыв дверъ на <font color="#cccccc">моблокон
      </font>балкон начал креститься и кланяться не разгибаясь, а
      сгибаясь всё ниже и ниже к груди, заметил что вывожу восьмёрку меж
      левым верхним и правым нижним углами.<br>
      <br>
      начал сйчас тож делать правой рукой, но почувствовал что эта рука
      мутит, повторил пару восьёмрок левой и пришлё писать сюда, поюду
      снова помолюсь молнияюм<br>
      <br>
      Удивился, что диавол в душе моей не возбухает, ведь я христианское
      в сущности богослужение совешаю, какое-то "еретическое"
      "герометическое" богуслужение совершаю. Но не сатанински ли я его
      совершаю, крестя себя правой рукой? хотел сказать левой рукой, но
      мопохоже что правою и впрямь сататниское, сетат state, senate, all
      are satans? if this world in the hands of the devil, they're and
      in christian faith it so is.<br>
      Похоже что я нашёл ритуал, устраивающий обе стороны классически
      символически представленные представителями якобы сидящими на моих
      плечах (понятно что это абстрактные понятия, которые раскидали по
      локосам<font color="#cccccc">и</font>, чтоб они не висели в
      воздухе забываясь массами тупорылыми) и я крестил же не титьки
      (хотя заметил в процессе что так делаю, исправившись заметил:) а
      плечи, и особенно если голова склонена, я увидел что вывожу кресты
      наподобие тех, что дирижёры обучены выводить:<br>

      Searching for these images I saw that there are different ways to
      do it, and the one I read in some book in dutch was more stretched
      left to right along a symmetic cross with long horisontal line and
      short vertical line. Didn't even find it, lol, it was similar to
      the second one. only the line 2 to 3 was straighter. and probably
      went in another direction (probably that I remember wrong)
      something similar to the top central one in this one, something in
      between it was, nevermind, why don't I weed this lyrics out!<br>

      означает это что дирижёр изначально музыкантов благословлял?
      музыкальная традиция определённо прошла через христианскую школу,
      однозначно это христианские влияния.<br>
      но кресты же не христиане изобрели? но едва ли поставить крест на
      ком-то было чем-то хорошим до них. cross<font color="#cccccc">ed</font>
