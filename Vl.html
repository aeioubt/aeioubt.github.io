      focusing solely on consonants and thus missing the point not being
      very good at foreign accents himself, even though he practiced not
      only what he preached, but unconsciously changing his vocalism to
      mimic the accent he didn't understood but somehow felt (or rather
      heard) but it probably was somewhere else, you'll find such
      examples yourself, because it being about vowels is still an
      unorthodox thought, even though it is correct.<br>

      забавно, что Алиестера Кроули ни там ни на вики не упомянают.<br>
      <br>
      scientists (the true scientist, those who look for the truth)
      disrespect magicians as some retards or crooks. and they're
      correct about it most of the time. Some magicians are actually
      scientists, but level of scientific thought of Aliester was found
      by me rather law, and allow me to demonstrate why: he describes
      how he and his friend invoked some demon to help his friend go to
      India. And they thought the invocation failed, but rather soon his
      friend found an opportunity to go to India with some ship. It
      convinced Aliester that spirit doesn't have to show himself or
      herself or itself <font color="#cccccc">to</font> oniself,
      themself, to magicians to grant their wish: maybe human sacrifices
      could make some spirit appear to try to make them stop: hindus say
      or buddhists say, I dont recognize usually who of them said what,
      that sufferings are self-inflicted by magi to make their wishes
      granted, but I think it grows from искусство требует жретв thing.

      Я накурен как исследователю духов и положено быть, но я не уверен

      неё вовнутрь, я боюсь. Don't fuck with aliester, that's what they
      try to tell you. Whatever he did is not for everybody, the
      knowledge of sacrifices are not even in his book as far as I could
      see, some mentionings of that, yes, but don't I do the same? don't
      I mention this scary shit? This book is to be stoopeed right here

      they're somewhat similar. I want my heat to held and body wiggled
      in amiotic liquid so my neck relaxes completely. But what if it
      will tear a muscle or two? how strongly or accurately are you

      So white world is in some better hands, we try to have some good
      things and even though we (europeans) had our own autodaf***s and
      now it seems enemies opened the gates. Some jews seem to believe
      in their own myths and that is only natural that such jews want to
      take a revenge. Why did jews revolt? Because we didn't give them
      Jerusalem when we had it. We could expell all the arabs (and then
      we would be the bad guys) so we gave it to them to do the job, and
      oh they're doing. Arabs to arabia? What about palestinian arabs?
      They're palestinians? Some of them consider themselves
      palestinians and not arabs the same way I consider myself cyberian
      and not russian. Until Cyberia is in better hands, I will be
      considered russian by everyone around me. Even if Japan takes over
      (never gonna happen, not this far, we better don't blow this
      structure, because we'll have to fight for our right to be free
      from the fuckers of all sorts. Russian gangsters will openly take
      over and will become colonels and such, but military people are
      crazy. Do you think there are no crazies among gangsters? Who do I
      write it for? For myself first of all. Will I ever read it? When I

      But yea back to crowley and scientists: for them it would be
      classical apophenia and person building theories upon such a not
      only anecdotal, but outright weak evidence cannot be considered
      scientist. But are they right? The guy practiced magick
      successfully but isn't it all just magic? "spirits could be shouwn
      to ignorant audience in a smoke if a glass with a figurine of the
      spirit be placed before the only source of light in the dark room
      lighted only with the source of the smoke. And if the source is
      fire-less or fire is hidden, the impression could be incredibly
      bright. It's just my guess, I need to make an experiment to tell.
      Today public are more sofisticated and thus magic is placed under
      the k of knowledge of some abstract speculations and accidents are
      turned into miracles and some psychological element to it all is
      also present: imagine how bold is someone who overstepped the
      strongest taboos: a fighter tells me that your scream is different
      after you've beaten someone. Thanks for this forbidden knowledge,
      oh fighter, but I had to tell you off for some political reasons.

      I think I just reinvented крёстное знамение: прикоснувшись

      что левая рука у сердца, зачем бы надевали кольцо на левую руку,
      если не была она священней, правая с разумом, левая с сердцем.
      Православные прямо в названии объявляют свою особенность
      орто-доксы орто скорей всего тоже of right словно до них делали по
      другому, и это сочетается с тем, что византийская империя, хоть и
      держала звание Рима дольше, "и тем трудней чем дольше" – это от
      недостатка фантазии у них же, всё за старое цеплялись. К тому что
      если эта христианская магия работает, то в странах под
      предводительством протестантов оно работает лучше всего, знать они
      правильно молятся. У католиков чуть похуже (папа и вся эта
      пиздабратия коррупционная, всё о власти миркой пекутся при том что
      мир во власти сатаны и кто они держащие власть в этом мире) у
      православных вообще всё швах. хуже только у муслимов, у которых
      где-то вровень с коммунистами, в Афганистане были и те и другие,
      разница не знаю, может им заметней чем со стороны. Если кто
      думает, что это вопрос дискуссионный, люди голосуют ногами
      однозначно в сторону протестантско-католических стран. Причины
      объяснять на этих страницах смысла нет: те кто не видят сами не

      Left hand being more magical could explain muslimic tradition of
      not raising left hand: you have to greet friends with your right
      hand, keep the left hand for yourself: in islam you're supposed to
      wipe your arse with it. They take magic more seriously, they're
      more archaic (in reflection of Byzantine, but they're even further
      in the past) Sun comes every day, seasons come every year, to
      count longer periods, it seems natural to refer to some event as
      the reign of some king, as the event the most of laws depend on.
      As they did before mochamad in russian mocha is urine, that is
      where they immediately fail with russic nations, even though it's
      not obvious even to russic nations themselves, because they call
      mochammed mohamed (not ch, h, the same way englishmen pronounce
      it. Could english orthography be the bant working via russian?<br>

      english intelligence of Lourence for what you cannot stop lead.
      You cannot leave process in the neighbouring countries go by
      itself. Who know where it can lead them. May them work in
      accordance to our goals. The common goals, let us be the deciders
      of the fates. Who we? Those who speak english. But we all think
      differently and we all lead different ways. So be it, we have the
      advantage before those who don't: we have access to tens more of
      information they do. It gives unearned advantage to common public
      of brittich commonwealth. Just as latin gave such advantage to
      italians. Let's see how brits lead this world better than romani
      ever could. Gipsies pretend to be of both, Rome and Aegyptos. Big
      deal, евреи are of europe. Where are you from? I'm from here,
      there, everywhere. <br>

      При очередной молнии почувствовал её аж в пальцах левой ноги,
      пошёл поклониться: открыв дверъ на <font color="#cccccc">моблокон
      </font>балкон начал креститься и кланяться не разгибаясь, а
      сгибаясь всё ниже и ниже к груди, заметил что вывожу восьмёрку меж
      левым верхним и правым нижним углами.<br>
      <br>
      начал сйчас тож делать правой рукой, но почувствовал что эта рука
      мутит, повторил пару восьёмрок левой и пришлё писать сюда, поюду
      снова помолюсь молнияюм<br>
      <br>
      Удивился, что диавол в душе моей не возбухает, ведь я христианское
      в сущности богослужение совешаю, какое-то "еретическое"
      "герометическое" богуслужение совершаю. Но не сатанински ли я его
      совершаю, крестя себя правой рукой? хотел сказать левой рукой, но
      мопохоже что правою и впрямь сататниское, сетат state, senate, all
      are satans? if this world in the hands of the devil, they're and
      in christian faith it so is.<br>
      Похоже что я нашёл ритуал, устраивающий обе стороны классически
      символически представленные представителями якобы сидящими на моих
      плечах (понятно что это абстрактные понятия, которые раскидали по
      локосам<font color="#cccccc">и</font>, чтоб они не висели в
      воздухе забываясь массами тупорылыми) и я крестил же не титьки
      (хотя заметил в процессе что так делаю, исправившись заметил:) а
      плечи, и особенно если голова склонена, я увидел что вывожу кресты
      наподобие тех, что дирижёры обучены выводить:<br>

      Searching for these images I saw that there are different ways to
      do it, and the one I read in some book in dutch was more stretched
      left to right along a symmetic cross with long horisontal line and
      short vertical line. Didn't even find it, lol, it was similar to
      the second one. only the line 2 to 3 was straighter. and probably
      went in another direction (probably that I remember wrong)
      something similar to the top central one in this one, something in
      between it was, nevermind, why don't I weed this lyrics out!<br>

      означает это что дирижёр изначально музыкантов благословлял?
      музыкальная традиция определённо прошла через христианскую школу,
      однозначно это христианские влияния.<br>
      но кресты же не христиане изобрели? но едва ли поставить крест на
      ком-то было чем-то хорошим до них. cross<font color="#cccccc">ed</font>

      I told before that axioms can be proven from their definitions (so
      definitions are new axioms) and recently somebody at 4chan has
      proven that parallel lines don't cross: somethin like x + 3 = x -
      5 by building the graphs for y = x + 3 and y = x - 5 to
      demonstrate that they'rre parallel and this algebraic
      representation translates that axiom into a more simple unequality
      of different numbers (numbers that are at some non-zero distance
      from each other)<br>
      and this difference has something to do with music theory, notes
      in the chord are at some distance from one another. Pythagoras
      worked with both music and math, and probably some mythes are
      invented by him, who knows. Muthic. Muzh, probably
      mistransliterated as Vir.<br>
      v reminds ν which is n which is next to the m and probably it's
      cognate.<br>
      i reminds ו which is у, u<font color="#cccccc">, oo ii ? </font><br>
      positionally it is v or even f (v is read as f in german) because
      it's f in latin. and F (or W?) was in greek so they say<font
        color="#666666">, I don't remember this. </font><br>

      ת in the group of אמש (in the form of the conductor's cross)
      supports the hypothesis that אמת is the three. Or is אמשת the

      hebrew and as "person" in yiddish.<br>

      Today I found a book from a guy I follow at academia.edu where he
      speaks that ogham is ancient. It is of 12 years ago, could it
      influence my "and ogham is the origin of it"? because I saw that
      coin before and cannot find it anywhere else.<br>
      <a href="https://www.academia.edu/4134903/Proto-Ogham"><font
          color="#000000">https://www.academia.edu/4134903/Proto-Ogham</font></a>
      is the link<br>
      there he massively resonates with my revelations: "Hibernian" he
      uses make me think of Iberian (hibernian is irish) Irish lore-ish?
      nah, too baseless yet. and he follows delivering with Celtiberian
      scripts. He only places it next to the term Coelbrenni which leads
      to some forgers of runes (and I will probably demonstrate their
      pre-Tolkien infusions into body of runic scripts but not today)
      and another new word is glozelian, but so far it only lead me to
      some obscure research I copied a couple of images from (they're
      clickable to that page)<br>

      Some enormous ammounts of literature about writing systems there
      are it may take me forever, but I must have all the time in the
      world, once I develop my capsule for living in artificial amniotic
      fluid.<br>
      <font color="#999999">But don't I know that each year every field
        produces more new knowledge than a specialist would be able to
        read in a hundred years? And this is probably the first example
        of information singularity, for they say future is already here,
        it's only not equally distributed. As it should.<br>
      </font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Now it's time to do something I had to make in vol.1: Compare
      those paleohispanic scripts together with celtiberian, the most
      widely used form of them all.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="Vl_files/united_paleohispanic.png" alt="" width="779"
        height="4087"><br>
      Smaller forms in black in the right bottom corners of some iberian
      are taken from ancientscripts.com which is currently down oh why
      didn't I use teleport pro or something of the kind to mirror all
      that site for moments like this, gush! <br>
      As you can see, the researchers disagree on which form is voiced
      and which is voiceless and which form is stroked and which is not,
      though I don't know the difference between them either. And as for
      that voiced and voiceless thing, I'd go with additional stroke
      making it stronger, voiced, because that is how G is different
      from C, and this very feature make paleohispanic scripts related
      to runes (if the common forms were not enough) and runes have the
      same confusion: ᚴ is ofteh attributed to G, which makes sens,
      because it looks pretty much like Г (but Г stands at the position
      of C) and ᚵ is often considered to be K (which also makes sense,
      because K is different from ᚴ by being one stroke bigger, but I
      made it the other way around (probably being in the wrong, who
      knows - write me if you do) because I didn't see the dot on
      neither of ᚴ's of bornholm alphabetic stone (probably because it
      was marked by paint) so I allowed myself to feel free to make it
      my way. Time will show, maybe it will show that this disagreement
      is ancient and dialectal, because both C &amp; G used to be the
      same letter.<br>
      <br>
      also something wicked is in the term I never saw before:<br>
      <font size="+1">Hesperia, ancient Greek name for the Italian
        Peninsula<br>
        Hesperia, ancient Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula</font><br>
      As if the Hisperian nation used to control Italian peninsula, but
      was forced to leave it for the Western territories. But it's just
      a guess, based on these two lines from wiki. <span title=""

      Northern Iberian script:<br>

          src="Vl_files/iberian.gif" alt="" border="0" width="587"

      Southern Iberian script:<br>

      and of course I am clueless about how reliable these
      transliterations are. Remember futhark? heh.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      This paleohispanic script has more archaic features than greek,
      thus greek historians distorted reality for political reasons.
      It's more archaic before we can recognize much more of archaic
      greek, thus greek is more modern, latin is actually modern for
      past 2000 years or so. So it's some roman летоисчесление. <br>
      I will try to retransliterate paleohispanic the same way I did
      with futhark. I yet have to try to read runic text in
      retransliterated futhark. f for a, just as in Hesperian.

      Я сейчас повторял свою мысль которую подумал о копирайте, но я
      останавливаю этим ход мысли, чтоб записать старую мысль, я мог бы
      дойти гораздо дальше если бы не парился графоманией. Законы о
      копирайте - законы заради жадных людей (для радости жадин, жыд) в
      то время как кто-то здесь посвящает всю свою жизнь общей пользе,
      продвижению науки. Зачем нам палеография? Человечество хочет всё
      знать, хотя бы за этим. Но и затем чтоб понимать языки, а не
      зубрить их. В том смысле что законы о копирайте нужно
      пересмотреть, а пока пересматриваем - отменить, потому что от них
      больше вреда чем пользы (но кому-то очень много пользы, постоянный
      интерес с неплохими доходми и несуществующей ответственностью, нет
      законов против того чтоб так закон начальственно вертеть. И я
      позволяю себе вертануть его со страниц этого необычного издания. Я
      его отменяю, создаю общественное мнение, под которые законåм
      принято подстраиваться. Но вернёмся к испанскому письму, На
      которое может испанский язык перейдёт как на руны переходят
      язычники севера.<br>
      Язычники без губных? Без М какой-то палевоиспансий.<br>
      <br>
      There seem to be no unicode for paleohispanic yet, so I use
      similar letters explaining when needed:<br>
      А Р R D all these å-liny can be read in hisparic P (officially
      transliterated as A)<br>
      E looks like both o and ه) ه is at position of e alright, but it's
      a in tifinagh, and it's similar to e...<br>
      gosh, my head boyl, don't touch forms you don't recognize, just
      notice that the giants on whose shoulders I stand (the kids who
      discovered all those scripts) recognize them as forms I recognize.
      I recognized it as o, but if it's really e (they read some texts)
      then ه<br>
      E in northern Iberia is closer to the one we all know. So ه is in
      accord with tifinagh ⴰ which s porobably not a but э? First in
      Africa, second in Europe. <br>

      this tradition is not necessary more ancient, because it doesn't
      have as many archaic features as paleohispanic (which not only
      demonstrates many long obsolete forms, some half-mythical forms
      like M being san, I finally found it, I found this san, it could
      be in some semitic, as they make me think, but I met it here, in
      Celtiberian<font color="#cccccc">, and I still think it could be

      this tradition is not more ancient, it's the same period as greek

      before them they occupied Iberia:<br>

      No labial before vowel this time. The last line follows the last

      say ᚱᛣ is double R too, but that's not for sure: ⵖ the ɣ is more
      likely to be the cognate of ᛣ) and then three S's reflect ᛋ, two

      Here I compre "Greco-Iberian" to other Iberian scripts, and I
      found it to be not Iberian at all:<br>

      Surprisingly, it seems only Δ and Λ have exact match, the next
      similar is Α <br>
      which makes Α Δ Λ the basis, which make me suspect that Δ used to
      be instead of B, which would explain the similarity of b &amp; d
      and deda for mama in georgian. But let's keep on watching it, it's
      too early to make such conclusions. It easily can be something
      else. Γ/K have forms even more similar than A, thus it's Α Δ Γ Λ,
      a form of S similar to ᛋ and maybe N which could be a form of ᛋ
      herself. especially because some S's look like M which is confused
      with N all the time (here western celtiberian M is N in other
      iberians, I spoke about m/n invariance before and I will collect
      it when I sort these drafts out. мы/нас, nos, us, in/im, <img

      <font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three Fates created the
        first five vowels of the alphabet and the letters B and T. It is
        said that Palamedes, son of Nauplius invented the remaining
        eleven consonants. Then Hermes reduced these sounds to
        characters, showing wedge shapes because cranes fly in wedge
        formation and then carried the system from Greece to Egypt*.
        This was the Pelasgian alphabet, which Cadmus had later brought
        to Boeotia, then Evander of Arcadia, a Pelasgian, introduced
        into Italy, where his mother, Carmenta, formed the familiar
        fifteen characters of the Latin alphabet. Other consonants have
        since been added to the Greek alphabet. Alpha was the first of
        eighteen letters, because alphe means honor, and alphainein is
        to invent.[<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Greek_alphabet"><font
            color="#000000">9</font></a>]</font><br>
      <br>
      I trust Hyginus' account the most, because it describes the
      structure of the alphabet, thus he knows more, and he keeps on in
      consistency to what I found: palamedes invented both, 11
      (additional to 7) letters and dice at the same time, and 18 is
      divided into three dice perfectly. And only then have Hermes
      simplified images to symbols of letters, and Cadmus, only after
      that system got to Egypt, brought it to Beotia, where his mother
      (who probably knew that one slot was to be empty, for
      pre-Palamedian dice could be blue for B &amp; red for T and only
      count vowels. That would correspond with knucklebones having on.y
      four numbers and cubic dice could become necessary when additional
      letter appeared. 15 is also a very interesting number, because if
      there are 5 vowels, it gives 3 forms of syllables or three matters
      of alphabet: whether ABC, vowel labial lingual; or BCD, labial
      velar coronal of paleohispanic syllabary.<br>
      is it anohter reason of whay a reminds d so much? <br>

      But I return to all that just to introduce Pelasgian Alphabet: I
      thought it was unknown, but this image from who knows where (I
      made it clickable but it doesn't lead far) tells some alphabet
      similar to Etrurian (sc = R?) is exactly Pelasgian, who knows..<br>

      Is it from some ancient book where phoenician looked like
      something completely different from what it looks like in between
      20th and 21th centuries? (it's 2020 to be precise) and where is
      this page even from? Is it just some freakery? Is the author of it
      just ignorant. Very unlikely. I have asked the question, I will
      look into phoenician writings when I... aye aye aye<br>

      To my surprise I accidentally placed different ammount of
      consonants around the third vowel, but it's just okay, because of
      doubling of z in that vowel's line tells that that someone's
      mistake just neutralizes mine. But even though I'm not sure if
      this axial symmetry is even a thing (because I still never read
      about it, never met a writ, a word about it) and the doubling of ᚴ
      as ᚵ (even though I didn't see that dot on that artefact) didn't
      confuse me. But now it makes me think: doesn't this doubling allow
      ᚢ to be U and not V (as my axial symmetry tells) eh? and it does,
      but such axial symmetry still looks kinda wrong, so I'd better
      discard that hypothesis of its ever being known completely so I
      just discarded that modified image instead.<br>
      But the question of sabaean remains. I never researched it
      properly, I maybe will.<br>
      <br>
      But I've been wrong again: that alphabet is right to left, thus
      the letter from the axial-y-line (axial-i-line to be precise) it's
      not y, it's i (it's shortened probably due to arabic influence.
      Did arabs preserved phonetic values of vowels? They pronounce
      vowels very well, their nashids are <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      So the only way to lay sabaean into axial is by removing one of
      z's and it will be still not that pretty:<br>
      (chances of that was 50% so not that impressive, or was it 100%?
      for otherwise I wouldn't cut off 𐩼)<br>

      It is halaham! but let's arrange this mess by order:<br>
      I didn't know where to place 𐩼 so I found another source of
      information, and it surprised:<br>
      <a

      𐩶 <font color="#3333ff">𐩰</font> 𐩮 𐩳 𐩤 𐩧 𐩦 𐩩 𐩻<font
        color="#999999"> (𐩯 𐩽 𐩾 𐩿)</font><br>
      but let's combine it as the previous image did:<br>
      <font color="#999999">(𐩳 𐩽 𐩾 𐩿) </font><font color="#ff0000">𐩱</font>
      <font color="#3333ff">𐩨</font> 𐩴 𐩵 <font color="#ff0000">𐩠</font>
      𐩭 <font color="#3333ff">𐩥</font> 𐩸 𐩢 𐩷 <font
        color="#ff0000">𐩺</font> 𐩫 𐩡 <font color="#3333ff">𐩣</font>
      𐩹 𐩬 <font color="#999999">𐩼</font> 𐩪 𐩦 𐩯 <font
        color="#999999">𐩼</font> <font color="#ff0000">𐩲</font> <font
        color="#3333ff">𐩰</font> 𐩮 𐩤 𐩧 𐩻 𐩶 𐩩<br>
      (it places 𐩹 at the fifth position, where in the previously found
      order it is at 15th.)<br>
      So I challenge both the abecedaries: they're further from grace
      then the modern counterparts of them:<br>
      in comparative chart some g is between o &amp; p, <br>
      and in previous chart o &amp; p together but kh is between e &amp;
      f.<br>
      Was it some creativity of archeologists or some sobaean
      mashtots-like reformer? I doubt it, priests in that period had to
      know the structures.<br>
      <br>
      and now it's more obvious what is halaham:<br>
      <font color="#ff0000">𐩠</font> 𐩡 𐩢 <font color="#3333ff">𐩣</font>
      𐩤 <font color="#3333ff">𐩥</font> 𐩦 𐩧 <font color="#3333ff">𐩨</font>
      𐩩 𐩪 𐩫 𐩬 𐩭 𐩮 𐩯 <font color="#3333ff">𐩰</font> <font
        color="#ff0000">𐩱</font> <font color="#ff0000">𐩲</font> 𐩳 𐩴
      𐩵 𐩶 𐩷 𐩸 𐩹 <font color="#ff0000">𐩺</font> 𐩻 𐩼 𐩽 𐩾 𐩿 <br>
      Comparison to the alphabetic order allows me to colour halaham and
      it becomes obvious, that it's some prayer, because it is: הלחמ and
      I thought it was Elohim, but google's dictionary tells it's Bread.
      And it correlates with Jesus calling bread his godly flesh. Хлеб
      всему голова? В начале хлеб родил небо и землю (хляби? манна
      небесная?)<br>
      God is אלוהים.<br>

      I don't recognize this order or if it is an order at all (it's
      clickable, so figure it out by yourself)<br>
      <br>
      another sabaean abecedary independently came to me from Hans
      Richter when we discussed ugaritic:<br>
      <a href="https://www.pinterest.at/pin/692498880183257422/"><img

          border="0" width="1128" height="868"></a><br>
      some doubts had I about hieratic, so I looked other sources and
      they said "maybe"<br>
      <img src="img/051.png" alt="" width="330" height="314">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;









      <img src="img/050.png" alt="" width="629" height="331"><br>
      <br>
      And in that letter about ugaritic these images from “The Story of
      Writing” by Andrew Robinson:<br>
      <br>

      But I'm still sceptical about those additional ugaritic letters,
      and I'm gonna be sceptical until I see the actual artefact from
      which that copy is alegedly made.<br>

      I sent him this text which can be an interesting chapter of this
      book, so I don't have to repeat what I told him about what I
      discovered as I wrote the letter actually:<br>

      but only Elohim is אלוהים and הלחם is "the bread" (which makes me
      think about Jesus calling bread his divine flesh, and there's a
      proverb in Russian "хлеб всему голова" (bread is head to
      everything) and heavenly abyss is named хляби (hlyabi) in
      old-russian (native russian speakers usually hardly know what it
      means (they (just as me) would only say that it's a sky, but if we
      only know it in the context of "хляби небесные" then it's heavenly
      sky. or if that is what opened up before the Deluge, could people
      think of clouds as of bread? the most similar word to hlyabi is
      хлеб [hleb] (bread, hlaef) and manna is thought of as semolina
      (манна &amp; манная каша &amp; манка) it all could be just nothing
      and volk-etimologie, but
      https://classes.ru/all-russian/russian-dictionary-Vasmer-term-15007.htm
      also doesn't really know where that word comes from, but gives an
      old form (literally хлеб) and for whatever reason connects it to
      Middle High German slamp (they translate it as feast) and Dutch
      slemp (which they translate as "tasty food") and another meaning
      of word хляби is liquid filth, which could be linked to batter and
      porridge (kasha)<br>
      Since you like looking for god's names in abecedaries, I felt like
      sharing this.<br>
      also the final letters of Ugaritic alphabet can be read as Tius
      (but I'm sure about it even less than about that the-lehem,
      because lehem for hemel looks very likely if saying that moon is
      made of cheese is of ancient origin. Ancient people could get
      lsd-trips from time to time because of ergot, and bread again
      being white next to black ergot growing like a snake out of
      ear(oor) I wonder why you call it so, in russian we destinguish
      colos from colossus but it's close to spike, not ear or is it as a
      rabbit's ear?) that could be real good and evil tree because some
      powerful evil it could cause: gangrene because of vessels spasm.
      And wish to grow ergot for sorcery could be a reason for witchhunt
      whence "spoiling the crop" would be not such a baseless
      occusation. War on drugs is the continuation of the witch-hunt.)<br>

      Okay, this one is still raw, but If you only knew what have found
      in my notebook tonight!<br>
      It's in london copybook (the serie after american public transport
      serie which was after fish serie)<br>
      Voiced Sonor Voiceless as three mothers (in russian Voiceless is
      just deaf, and that is the old mother)<br>
      ABGD (because they say that C was voiced when C and G was the same
      letter (some long ago))<br>
      IMLN (l is probably lingual click, imitating horse, because Ma is
      also horse, and No is Go for horse)<br>
      OPST (because Q is not met in the most of alphabets, because R is
      Р in russian, `cause ᚱ is probably П)<br>
      <br>
      IMLN is probably IMKN (but then k is not sonor, and L is similar
      to Г like λ is similar to ג) <br>
      <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
      because If H is И then HIJKL is the same И claster, and LMN is
      IMN.<br>
      So that velar column is all freaky and uncertain, and it becomes
      much better if we only keep less ambiguous letters:<br>
      ABD<br>
      IMN (but if M =N, then IML, which pretty much contradicts what I
      just said about I = L, but if M = N then isn't N = И = H first
      because 'n' of and is и and second because N is Н in russian and И
      used to be written as H in old-russian)<br>

      Just as sefer Yetzirah mentions only water of lips and fire of
      tongues (and air for vowels is not in the jewish text, only in
      translations. I'd say vowels are solids, as land in Африка,
      Ивропа, Остия<br>
      I thought I was India, because it promotes K in indian fashion.<br>
      E was Europe. But only when there was E. When there's only I it's
      Iberia or some other Europe.<br>
      Now I have no reason to think of O as of asian line, because who
      in the Ost passes labies first?<br>

      AMT is read by diagonal, the truth. AMS could also go by that
      diagonal, if S was the other silent, but before C appeared there
      could be no S, so I think. only Ш maybe&amp; Ш &amp; Ⰿ-like T of
      upside down Ш.<br>
      I only saw final Z, not final S, so I go with final T. The Truth
      (sefer yetzirah mentions that three mothers is a great mistery, so
      don't expect it to be too open. <br>
      After all there's no third element, only B &amp; T, and AMT could
      be left to be figured out by someone who actually knows hebrew (I
      actually don't, but I still managed to figure it out because of
      how accessible thee extra-cortex of the internet-powered

      scandinavian alphabets are those who follow this tradition. Others
      place new vowels next to their original forms, and semites even

      I'e bbeen promising to put this project on hiatus for some time
      now, but I'm mouthful of thc-powered smoke again. So weed is a
      drug, because this habit controls my action stronger than
      intellect, or with the same power: it has to rationalize the
      smoking, so I have to work on the intellectual level to give up
      weed. How it rationalizes it today: I don't have anything else
      coming my way anyway (false!) and I haven't finished here yet
      (true!) the first one is referring to no arranged meetings for
      today, no even money to start building my apartment to motivate
      the investors to fund me further, and I spent the funds I kept for
      materials on weed instead. (true)<br>

        for new contracts. </font>I must make science, not business.<br>
      <br>
      This is the main argument. I don't want to work with my hands
      either (I use them to type, traumas are especially unwanted) I
      have to hire professionals, so we work from other sides of the
      professional spectres. arts and technologies.<br>

      First I convinced me to work on this field instead of medicine
      because I thought I'm close to the break-through, after which they
      will recognize me and I can make contacts with truer biologists
      than myself.<br>
      It came out that academic public is fucking clueless and not even
      interested (they're not interesting them selves too) so I only met
      a couple of researchers on the field I'm currently in. Others
      remain clueless, but these two at least see the axial symmetry
      (one of them sees it more clearly, the other is more educated, but
      both of them are not professional linguists, just like I am also
      not by academic standarts: nobody pays me for my work but my
      Mäzen.<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I sent a letter to J. Richter today, you may find it interestign
      too:<br>
      <br>
      <i>Why do you set apart L &amp; R, when they're one above the
        other?</i><i><br>
      </i><i>Do you know there are more than one form of R: russians
        (and maybe scottish too) pronounce it at the same position L is,
        only vibrating by the tip of the tongue, so their R (or Р,
        that's how russians draw it, their P is П, that's a greek thing)
        while brits (and maybe french too) pronounce it by uvula - you
        don't even have uvulars in your table.</i><i><br>
      </i><i>Now, about that table: always count what was the chance of
        the position of the letter at that very spot: If you see how
        often labials follow vowels in english alphabet, you'll see that
        the answer is up to 80%, which does seem like a systemic (if you
        count Y in, it's 2/3 which is not that impressive, but still
        more than a half)</i><i><br>
      </i><i>It doesn't make sense to count another colum, if only one
        letter in that column: it could have standed anywhere and you'd
        see the same system in that case: you'd just place that column
        somewhere else.</i><i><br>
      </i><i>Recognize word apophenia and make your best to be sure that
        you're not following some false structures.</i><i><br>
      </i><i>Those additional letters in ugaritic is probably what made
        me say in that up to 20 years old piece of draft that more
        ancient writing systems don't follow this structure as well as
        modern english latin: how can we even be sure that the ugaritic
        abecedary is authentic. It supports Vowel-Labial-Linguals order
        not worse than others: only M i not in its place. But all the
        other columns (the distinct velar-coronal in english latin - and
        only there! is it one of reasons (or consequences) that the
        commonwealth rules the world?) all the other columns are a mess
        of linguals (just as the myth tells: 5 vowels, b &amp; t
        (neither K nor R, these are of later origin, together with h
        maybe, but the chronology of appearing of different letters is
        yet to be destinguished: no historic source will tell about:
        ugaritic abecedaries are on the verge of what is found and
        they're already complicated so much, that they're even further
        from the source-code than some alphabets used up-to-this day
        (maybe the final triliteral row is built upon canon and not
        expanded yet, that is what makes it even more interesting
        (together with runic alphabet stone from Bornholm, which
        preserved the first raw in the form of ᛆᛒᚦ, where ᚦ is both
        Г&amp;D, or B is both b&amp;c, which is less likely, but who
        knows, I know few reasons of why velars could be born not by
        linguals, but by labials: mama is kaka in japanese, not labials
        but velars are the first consonants in eastern alphabets and
        syllabaries, c is graphically not that far from ᛒ, japanese
        p,f,b are made by diacritizing h, russians pronounce suffix -го
        (go) as -во (vo)</i><i><br>
      </i><i>But of course d has even more reasons to be the father: c
        is staveless d, ᚦ looks like г which looks like r, which is р in
        greek and russian, both are lingual - that is first of all, g is

      I used italic (almost cursive) and it's less of cursive than
      cursive: only few letters are cursive:<br>
      a &amp; <i>a</i>, g &amp; <i>g</i>, maybe v &amp; <i>v</i> are

      g is d.. is not correct, this form is never used in russian. only
      <i>g</i>, and with the swash too, is d in russian cursive. <i>but
        not italic: д is another form of russian </i>д. both <i>g

      both forms are ᚦ. and Д is as if it' ᚦ rotated counterclockwise. <br>
      I noticed before that d is Д rotated counterclockwise. And as
      clockwise is the lucky direction, russians (and greeks?) took it
      from the west (as we a<font color="#cccccc">j</font>lmo<font
        color="#cccccc">n</font>st always do, to be honest) and runic
      nations took it from us. But if it's not a charm, but a curse from
      an opressor (force nation to draw deus-letters cotated more open..
      is it more open? no, close is clo<font color="#cccccc">ckwi</font>se


      because it's lucky to keep tubes shut. <br>
      If reforms for whatever reason rotated letters counter-clockwise,
      did it open them? or was it some grammatic magic to oppress?
      either way, in this case russians took from normans and sent it to
      rome. Which is counter-intuitive, counter-historic, and why
      wouldn't grammarians of the nation (and neighbouring nations too,
      allies are always around) noticed that "one way is delight, the
      other is not, some naught" -- it's some ancient, magical, that I

      this voiced-voiceless thing is so native to me, that I will not be
      surprised if it's one of my earlier revelations, I had something
      this big and then I just forgot it, I only remember that it was
      something big in the alphabet, and I don't remember noticing the
      rhyme of the lines until adolescence when I got something to do
      with военкомат. I know it sounds weird, but&nbsp; this guy lives
      in my city, what were the chances, but I will know of this only if
      I meet him and he admits that we learnt at the same school. If
      he's my age, it's whether I told him that or he told me this (is
      it possible? I don't remember anybody but me knowing of that what
      I noticed, otherwise I would at least think of asking whoever told
      me of that, and I also felt like feeling it, not really
      understanding, or I would probably put it down, would have drawn
      it. did I? I would never know. Probably not. So he also uses
      livejournal, he can be of my age, but if he's not, then whether
      some longer transmission happened or he did discover it himself. I
      do need to talk to that guy, he could be the fourth in the group
      of superheroes.<br>

        П/Р) что просто выпало из головы. Спрашиваю потому что каковы
        шансы что мы оба из Челябинска? и не 1976 ли года рождения? к
        тому что может мы в одной школе учились или в одном кружке
        астрономии занимались. Я поместил ссылку на твой журнальчик (на

      Evans didn't invent it, he preserved it. Would church destroy or
      not allow it if it was heathan? Let's think nicely of him even in
      our arrogant guesses. <br>
      I spoke that if he invented, it, he'd make it similar to european
      in some sense, but sense in which it is similar to our alphabet is
      of such a nature that he probably didn't know about it, an some
      more obvious parallels are not seen, so whether he was of such a
      sorcerer-tier erudition even noone is in the internet aeon, and if
      he was then why is he not among the greatest, but some church
      clerk? Or whether it's the wisdom of history of writing itself
      showing us that aleut writing tradition. It is not aleut! Somehow
      it seems it's not aleut. wiki doesn't mention aleut, but it's
      still weird because it mentions several languages of that region,
      but not Aleut. Gosh, it doesn't even mention Eskimo, and all we
      the whites know is that there's only some eskimos in the middle of
      nowhere. Doesn't it mention aleut, because they don't want us to
      know of this nation, living among russia and usa and not giving a
      fuck about our... they have to give a fuck: they're not allowed to
      be one nation, Russians genocide nations. They're not allowed to
      visit their relatives, unless they get visa in vladivostok. than
      from petropavlovsk-kamchatsky they have to fly to that city across
      the border. So many gasoline burnts just to get a permition to
      some basal human right.<br>
      <br>
      So, back to cannadian aboriginal syllabics. Why is it in plural?
      Are there more than one? So many nations use it. Why would they
      choose this clumsy and unpopular system if it wasn't their own? It
      is their own. Now let's notice the structural features, that
      witness how it is an ingenous, related to ogham, first of all in
      their vowels: Evans would probably make it in latin order, and
      here we see something very similar to oghamic order: <font
        color="#ff0000">aouei</font> in ogham, <font color="#ff0000">aoie</font>
      in the northernmost america. Shows a-o distinction more basic than
      AV, . And their long forms are just in deeper strokes. It is some
      completely new feature, european way of writing doesn't allow such
      distinction.<br>
      <br>
      The bigger truth is there's no border between Europe and America.
      Ingenious people lived on those territories in such a large
      quantity, that they had many nations (Greenland is full with
      eyeliner fisheaters, danes are a minority in there, and some mad
      Icelandic king was expelled and lived in Greenland, from where he
      probably (I read of it in some historic article) setteled another
      colony to the West, and of course there they were never alone, if
      people can live there, they live there, at least as some secret
      place of their family, and invaders must die) <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Evans letters are similar to devanagari sometimes, but I'm pretty
      sure that theory is even worse form of apophenia than some lowest
      parts of this book. (thanks gods for having the highest parts)<br>
      <br>
      Devanagari vowels are in japanese order, also doubled with longis,
      so why wouldn't he add the stroke to make it double the way
      devanagari (and latin too) have? To be extravagant? Then he
      wouldn't work for the church (wouldn't that system crush his
      spirit long before giving him any position) of all the above I
      declare that Evans was a good and kind fellow, who so gracefully
      fooled the official idiots and villains that now we can know of
      Aboriginal syllabics of North America (they're also in Alaska and
      probably was used at soviet territories before they were occupied
      by russian orthodox church.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Hooray, I'm right:<br>

      <font size="+1">James Evans (January 18, 1801 – November 23, 1846)
        was an English-Canadian Methodist missionary and amateur
        linguist. He is best remembered for his claim of the invention
        of the "phonemics" writing system for Ojibwe and Cree, which was
        later adapted to other languages such as Inuktitut. While it was
        long believed that Evans was the original inventor of the
        phonemics writing system, there is some evidence to suggest that
        the Cree people already knew the writing system[<a

        Wesleyan Methodist missionary played a part in the first
        printings in syllabics at Norway House, He was not the person
        who was the most instrumental in the writing systems conception
        and spread. During my research I visited archives as well as
        Aboriginal communities in the Boreal Forest as well as the
        Eastern Arctic. Missionaries George Barnley, John Horden,
        Jean-Nicolas Laverlochère, Edmund Peck and Jean Baptiste
        Thibeault all arrived to Cree, Inuit and Dene nations who were
        already able to read and write in the system. A more complete

      John E. Murdoch (1927–2010), an American academic in the field of

      So how did I know that? I know their tricks: <br>
      they claim that Mashtotz created georgian alphabet which is
      obviously a lie (he didn't know this structure georgian alphabet
      preserves) <br>
      they claim Stephan created Permian script, when other travellers
      wrote that Parma has at least three of them without fucking
      russians.<br>

      by James Mooney or by conspirators before him, because he who
      controls the past controls the future, he who controls the present
      controls the past. <br>
      <br>
      For whatever reason they need us to believe that all the culture
      comes from some capital: so all the west is con<i>trolled</i> from
      Rome. And Russian script tells that all the Russia is controlled
      from Mos Cow.<br>

        and Inupiat are the only Northern indigenous peoples to have
        developed their own system of picture writing, but this system
        died with its creators.[14] Late nineteenth-century Moravian
        missionaries to the Yupik in southwestern Alaska used Yupik in
        church services, and translated the scriptures into the people's
        language.[15]</i><br>
      &gt; have developed their own system of picture writing, but this

      probably those mentioned by Demetrius, an Alexandrian philosopher
      of the first century BC, when he writes in his dissertation On
      Style: ‘In Egypt the priests sing hymns to the Gods by uttering
      the seven&nbsp; vowels in succession, the sound of which produces
      as strong a musical impression on their hearers as if the flute
      and lyre were used, but perhaps I had better not enlarge on this
      theme.’"<br>
      <br>
      He calls the strings vowels. Vowels define their lines. But what
      are the letters in lines, if lyre cannot зажимать струны, изменяя
      их частоту? Манера игры! Смычок и щипок. Долгая и краткая. ᛒ и ᚦ<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      and aeiou can depict the form of the lyre: <br>
      ---<br>
      --<br>
      -<br>
      ------<br>
      ------------<br>
      somehow it looks more like pan flute<br>
      <br>
      let's look at japanese vowels:<br>
      ---<br>
      -<br>
      ------------<br>
      --<br>
      ------<br>
      looks like no musical instrument would look.<br>
      <br>
      let's look at oghamic:<br>
      ---<br>
      ------<br>
      ------------<br>
      --<br>
      -<br>
      looks like some other variant of pan flute (but the previous
      variant I like more.<br>
      They all begin with a for some reason (and thus show their common
      roots)<br>
      what is common between japanese and european is this triad:<br>
      ---<br>
      -<br>
      ------------<br>
      <br>
      and ogham has it reversed:<br>
      ---<br>
      ------------<br>
      -<br>
      or<br>
      ---<br>
      ------<br>
      --<br>
      or<br>
      --<br>
      ----<br>
      -<br>
      depending on the transliteration and notation.<br>
      Are all these musical gamuts? They're the closest to gamuts I can
      imagine.<br>
      <br>
      And so we can encode speech into music.<br>
      <br>
      but if ᛒ and ᚦ sound similar to ᚠ and ᚵ<font color="#cccccc"> (or
        is it </font><font color="#cccccc">ᚠ and </font><font
        color="#cccccc">ᚴ?)</font> but on another note, then what is
      vowel?<br>
      Whether they didn't use vowels, or vowel was щипок и смычок
      одновременно.<br>

      AХС is a weird bisexual project: in its golden era it was an alpha
      with a great gal and a gay friend. <br>
      And that friend set a powerful question in the form of the link
      between heterosexuality and homosexuality: would you rather fuck
      an old woman or a young guy? If the woman is very old, then guy
      may seem as a better alternative: but we shouldn't make this
      choice: it's a false dichotomy: порока следует избегать, я был бы
      счастливее если бы не смотрел порно. и здоровее. есть всё же
      области этого мира, в которые не следует залезать. Говорят, что во
      многих знаниях многие печали, но не всякое знание несёт скорбь:
      многие из знаний облегчают <font color="#cccccc">и "упраздняют?
        почему это слово означает отмену? в праздник не работают" </font>жизнь.

      А значит зная чего именно избегать, или чем это заменять, ведь
      порно столь аддитивно, потому что замещает что-то очень важное.
      Любовь? взаимная любовь навсегда! о как бы это было прекрасно,

      погибших вельмож? чтоб те не предались блуду, желая заполнить
      пустоту от ушедшего мужчины. куда меня несёт. Зачем вообще этот

      Do believers open pores of their cells? I was imagining our soul

      Hygin - Fable 277<br>
      CCLXXVII.&nbsp; RERVM INVENTORES PRIMI.<br>
      <br>
      Parcae, Clotho Lachesis Atropos, inuenerunt litteras Graecas
      septem, Α Β Η Τ Ι Υ [?] ; alii dicunt Mercurium ex gruum uolatu,
      quae cum uolant litteras exprimunt; Palamedes autem Nauplii filius
      inuenit aeque litteras undecim [...] Simonides litteras aeque
      quattuor, Ω Ε Ζ Φ, Epicharmus Siculus litteras duas, Π et Υ. has
      autem [Graecas] Mercurius in Aegyptum primus detulisse dicitur, ex

      <br>
      <br>
      &gt; alii dicunt Mercurium ex gruum uolatu, quae cum uolant
      litteras exprimunt; <br>
      In spite of how it is in english translation, where this sentence
      is placed after the next, it goes right after that 7 letter
      sequence, and thus its "ex gruum uolatu" relates it to my
      conception of Many letters being the forms of V, Where Λ &lt; &gt;
      V are A E O U and I is the I, and X is both X &amp; + <font
        color="#999999">(which is T. both can be, but we do need B, and
        if V is U, it cannot be B, so whether there were only 4 vowels,
        as in hebrew and arabic, and then V was The B, or X was the B,
        just as H- syllables give birth to labial sounds in japanese,
        which is definitely connected to european scripts. I don't know
        yet how, but official imperialistic tradition declaring japanese
        culture merely an affiliation of the chinese one, is definitely
        doesn't look real if you compare those cultures side to side.
        Today we can, it the past it was impossible for an european, so
        I think. People travelled much, so how do I know, but how many
        educated men who had opinions on this version of history
        travelled enough to make an educated opinion? How many japanese
        could see what china actually is like? So they accepted the
        belief? Because they were occupied by china for a couple of
        centuries. Britain was also occupied by France for a couple of
        centuries. Nobody tells France brought them culture, I think,
        but maybe only because Romans did. Romans held Britain long
        enough to build some roads and deliver some terminology (though
        it's not easy to say if some terms are roman or french, because
        both are roman)) </font><br>
      X is double V. <br>
      If V is U and vowel, then double V is W which is never vowel
      (unless E gives it its voice becoming an j, as in new. But who
      said new should be written this way? on what grounds?<br>
      So W is double V. Thus X ~ W? wxy (x is among the v-gang. right
      next to w) and isn't I half of V? Thus V is the basic form, and
      thus there shouldn't be more than 4 of them. But Ⰳ which is
      something between Ⰲ and Ⰴ can say otherwise, but isn't it a form
      of C, which is &lt;? C=E? С=Σ!<br>
      So can V be W?<br>
      V is both U &amp; W!<br>
      U in one dialect can be V in the neighbouring one:<br>
      . . I thought ukreignian U is V in russian, but в is в and у is у.<br>

      Ⰲ and Ⰴ is devinitely V &amp; Λ (actual L is Ⰾ which is the Ⰴ with
      a line in the centre. this font, this unicode in 2020 shows some
      other forms of glagolythic I have seen in books (probably because
      I saw russian forms and these are probably serbian) so I add the
      forms I saw and after them is their unicode:<br>

      somewhat varied order and three additional letters: ⰬⰭⰮ or are
      they somewhaere from before, I'll figure it out somewhere further.<br>
      <br>
      40 figures in the image, <br>
      first row goes the same 10 signs in the both representation, but
      the second line is one-letter bigger in the unicode: ⰊⰋⰌⰍⰎⰏⰐⰑⰒⰓⰔ<br>
      Ⰺⰺ is the other form of Ⰹⰹ or Ⰻⰻ (I know it looks like 8 on my
      screen, I hope it also does at yours, because I think unicode can
      be displayed differenty, so in the following example you can see
      how the same unicode is displayed differently:<br>

      Ⰽ looks like ᛋ (both are probably c's) but you can see in the

      want to be in the water so my feet look sorta downwards, so all he

      the second mother is us. The firs one is god, the third one's the
      devil, the death. So is бог related to birth? both are b mother.
      bcd so I see. I was speaking of the first mother and thought of
      her as of b. How is that? The first rune? The first letter of the

        same signs in different cells, which tells it's all not certain
        (and different people pronounce the same sounds differently) and
        unnecessary when audio-recordings is widely available (but not
        in books made out of trees)<br>
