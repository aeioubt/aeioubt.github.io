                Let's compare the simplest chinese hieroglyphs to
                alphabetic signs we know:<br>
                E &amp; M use 4 strokes, so let's watch chinese
                hieroglyphs of up to 4 strokes thinking of them as of
                simple enough to make letters, and I take japanese form
                of it, also to compare it with chinese hieroglyphs:<br>

              rather watch at divination bones, those should be simpe, I
