      <p>Further you will see that it isn't a coincidence. For now you
        can ignore the mess in the last line of the alphabet, archaic
        alphabets didn't have it at all (so hebrew ends at T)<br>
      </p>
      <p>Common people think velars are made not by tongue, but
        somewhere in throat, there's even a linguistic term for this
        misconception: they call <font color="#333333"><font
            color="#666666">some of</font> </font>them guttural. <font
          color="#999999">(And though guttural don't exist in english,
          dutch goed (g is guttural) is related to english good (g is
          velar), here I didn't know what guttural meant, beware that it
          happens sometimes, for I dig very wide field, I am
          occasionally misinformed here &amp; there, and I don't have an
          institution making fact-checking, yet. anyway, dutch g is not
          far from english h in hot, but h-kind has some other name, but
          I don't operate these terms yet, and I will show that ipa
          definitions are not only different from ones ancient linguists
          had, but also sometimes wrong, as I explain only in volume <a

      <p>Greek Y can be also green, for it's a lingual consonant in
        words like "boy"<br>
      </p>
      <p>Though when it's vowel as in "body" it demands its own
        structure, and such structure also exists:<br>

      <p>Pay attention to L and R at left and right corners of such a
        representation of the alphabet, as if saying "yeah, it's not a
        coincidence" and these two structures can be met in all the
        other alphabets one way or another <font color="#C0C0C0"><font
            color="#999999">(russian doesn't follow it, but if we
            consider ЕЁИЙ not four letters, but two letters with

              width="651"></font></font><font color="#C0C0C0"><font
            color="#999999">because french &amp; german alphabets don't
            include letters made by diacritics as additional letters of
            the alphabet, but they use the very exact latin alphabet
            brits use. So does portugal, but spain added additional Ñ
            after N &amp; thus broke the axial structure</font> <font
            color="#D3D3D3">(they probably did it to use their alphabet
            as numerals, I will speak about it further)</font>
          Scandinavians added vowels with diacritics at the end of the
          alphabet, which can be a tail of the axial structure but
          messes with the lineal one. Russians also have additional
          vowels as the tail or a final row. Icelanders added much more
          additional letters inbetween, completely distorting the
          structure. Portugal uses the same latin alphabet we research
          here.</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>Latin alphabet goes further than just three elements and
        separates velars from coronals:<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/004.png" alt="" height="386"
          width="460"></div>
      <br>
      <p>But no other alphabet can demonstrate such a distinct column of
        k'eys. Reasons for such difference can be different, but when
        you read further you will understand why I think it's connected
        with number of elements being four in europe when in other
        places they were only three, even though now we know of five
        elements on the east, almost nobody knows of three mothers
        (three matters) — this cult is eradicated from most of the
        world, but people are taught of three fathers instead: whether
        as trimurti instead of tridevi, or as trinity instead of hecate
        or whatever you call them. Though we can still find mentioning
        of three mothers in sefer yetzirah as three letters (and those
        letters are of the three main groups: alef, mem, shin — and even
        though they teach that alef is not vowel, it's a rediculous
        claim whether you look at how it's transliterated and how words
        with it sound being compared to the same words but without him,
        or her if it's alpha — it's a complicated topic where I directly
        oppose the common point of view, further in the text I will
        explain in many details why.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/007.png" alt="" height="145"
          width="622"></div>
      <br>
      <p>And I also claim that initially alphabet was used for musical
        notations <font color="#999999">(as it's used today, but I say
          it was the initial use of it)</font> because music is the only
        field where you need to know how it sounds, when in common text
        hieroglyphics have a distinct advantage: it transmits
        information even if you speak another language <font
          color="#999999">(just as japanese people can understand some
          chinese hieroglyphs having immensely different spoken
          language)</font> you can argue that it can be a disadvantage
        in a military sense <font color="#999999">(which could be an
          explanation of why many alphabets having the same structure
          still differ in graphic side of theirs)</font> and ancient
        culture is known for concealing valuable information <font
          color="#999999">(probably that's one of the reasons beyond the
          fact we don't remember alphabetic structures described in this
          book)</font><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>But back to the musical side of the alphabet. What's the
        historic evidence of such a correlation, there's some also
        explaining greek H becoming vowel and breaking both axial &amp;
        lineal structures for greeks:<br>
      </p>
      <p>"The vowels added by the priests of Apollo to his lyre were
        probably those mentioned by Demetrius, an Alexandrian
        philosopher of the first century BC, when he writes in his
        dissertation On Style: ‘In Egypt the priests sing hymns to the
        Gods by uttering the seven&nbsp; vowels in succession, the sound
        of which produces as strong a musical impression on their
        hearers as if the flute and lyre were used, but perhaps I had
        better not enlarge on this theme.’"( <a

          Greek Myths</a>).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      </p>
      <p>It seems priests of Apollo didn't know of these structures,
        probably because these alphabets were invented before them, by
        those who worshiped female deities, not some guy named Apollo.
        It can be shown by the named creators of the first alphabet (all
        female) in the greek myth given above, and even in egypt itself
        another lady, Seshat, was considered the inventer of alphabet
        (with a little help from Thoth, but that could be a later
        addition.<br>

      <p>F &amp; P sounds are put by the same letter (standing where P

        h looks like a bigger r and when you write it by hand it often
        looks like R:</p>
      <p><img alt="" src="img/486.JPG" height="284" width="248"><br>
      </p>
      <p>sometimes h reflects s &amp; t:<br>
        h is named ʌʃ in latin, which makes it similar to ש which stands
        where s does.<br>
        h is named eitʃ in english, which makes it similar to ch which
        is an invariant of t.<br>
      </p>

        smaller one. It seems here some lands <font color="#C0C0C0">(vowels

          for earth, not for air — for jews it's air, because they lost

        pentatonica of abcd to 7-... why do I ignore that there's not 5
        &amp; 7, but 4 &amp; 6 letters? It relates to some musical
        concepts I only slightly remember. there are 4 &amp; 6 intervals
        between 5 &amp; 7 tones. And it relates to this image of the
        memorial stone of Gvido who allegedly invented the 7-note
        sequence we use today, but it only shows 6 of them:</p>
      <p><img src="img/277.png" alt="" height="404" width="646"><br>
      </p>
      <p>Does opqrst reflect abcd as well? After all a &amp; o are also
        similar:<br>
      </p>
      <p>ABCD<br>
      </p>
      <p>OPQRST<br>
        a&amp;o are vowels, a even sounds like o in all &amp; å<br>
        b&amp;p are labials (some culters don't distinguish between them
        also)<br>
        c can stand where q use to: qabala, but cabal (I will further
        speak of these words)<br>
        d is directly similar to t, but what about r &amp; s?<br>
        d is similar to russian &amp; scottish r, for those r's are made
        with tongue.<br>
        d is similar to s when in greek, they pronounce it as th in the.<br>
        But of course s in much more similar to c — it probably derives
        from it as ç<br>
        c is г in russian which reminds r in both looks &amp; sounds
        when r is english.<br>
        So how do I reconcile it with what I said before?<br>
        With that fact that in runes there are only 3 letters in the
        first line: ᛆᛒᚦ<br>
        More on this subject of actual antiquity of runes will arrive
        later.<br>
        And if we notice, that QR repeat OP sequence, OPST look like
        ABCD alright<br>
      </p>
      <p>ABCD<br>
      </p>
      <p>EFGH</p>
      <p>This pair of rows can be preventing humans from understanding
        this structure the most: D &amp; H — is there anything common
        between them? First of all, they both are made with tongue (you
        can breath out with tongue out, making a similar noise, but
        strictly speaking it will be some other phoneme) and it will be
        easier for you to see similarity if you keep in mind that c
        &amp; d used to be invariants and as F seems to be a palatalized
        form of B (just as E of A) H is palatalized C and g stands for d
        in russian alphabet, which is honestly not that far apart.<br>
      </p>
      <p>EFGH<br>
      </p>
      <p>IJKLMN<br>
      </p>
      <p>This row is the most difficult, because it is the only one
        where labial doesn't follow vowel directly. And it is universal
        among all the alphabets. I have proposed different reasons in
        the previous versions of this work, you can read it <a
          href="http://aeiou.ru/old1">here</a>. And now I'm only
        revisiting that material, making it more simple and clear.<br>
      </p>
      <p>You can see K under G, which could explain why they needed J as
        a separate leter. Exactly why they needed to separate U form V,
        to separate it's different readings. And as e-row ends with H,
        i-row ends with N — H is how N looks in russian. A weird things
        are n looks like v in greek and n stands for p sound in russian,
        and p stands for r in russian. It's an interesting topic of
        different approach to the same topic from greece and rome, I
        haven't researched it yet.<br>
      </p>
      <p>ABCD<br>
      </p>
      <p>UVWXYZ<br>
      </p>
      <p>that VW thing actually reflects russian БВ — I don't claim here
        that russian alphabet could influence the latin one, but I claim
        that the same (yet unknown) concepts could influence them both.
        Or, of course, it could all be just a coincidence.. nah, chaos
        is uncomprehended order.<br>
      </p>
      <p>X as we know it in english combines velar and coronal, and
        velar precedes coronal, as they do in alphabet. X as we know it
        in russian [h] it stands just beneath h. Y is secretly one of
        those UVW, but in english it's never made with libs, but with
        tongue instead. Z can be considered an invariant of X, because x
        sometimes sounds like z, but it also reflects D as Δ's read in
        greece today [ð]. Though russian alphabet descends from some
        from of greek, russians read their D, Д, as [d], but their
        second row ends with З [z] even though that row there is even
        more mutilated than in greek, it somehow shows that z it's place
        (in greek z replaces θ and the fact that θ is final in that row
        in both greek and hebrew alphabets could explainded why it's
        considered to be literally [θ] even though greeks pronounce it
        closer to [f] and russians never saw it as anything else but [f]
        which tells it's the lost labial in greek, and would be in
        russian if they didn't taboo this letter to elimination)<br>
      </p>
      <p>Now let's look at alphabet used for hebrew and yiddish:<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/008.png" alt="" height="297"

      <div align="right">אבגדהוזחטיכ(ך)למ(ם)נ(ן)סעפ(ף)צ(ץ)קרשת<br>
      </div>
      <p>If you were taught this alphabet, you may have a cognitive
        dissonance, because you were told that there is no vowels in
        hebrew alphabet. But if you just know the language, you may
        instead wonder why don't I consider ו (the 6th letter) vowel
        too. But you know it's semi-vowel (exactly like V &amp; Y being
        related to them) standing for both o &amp; u &amp; w. Yet mostly
        I consider it labial consonant v because labial consonant stands
        at that place in many other alphabets: f in latin, ვ in
        georgian, ᚠ in runic, soon I will tell you that runes have not
        only futhark order.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>And as for axial symmetry. Does jewish alphabet follow it. It
        does with those 4 vowels, and it's another reason to take ו as a
        consonant.<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/009.png" alt="" height="577"
          width="540"><br>
        <div align="left">
          <p>Here's a short essay about fallacy of the concept of
            consonant alphabets:<br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>And though in Hebrew י&nbsp; (yod) is reduced to [j] rather
            often, it still remains vowel in many cases (ישראל,&nbsp;

            <br>
          </p>
          <p>Though ע&nbsp; may seem consonant in רביעי, it will be

            כועס (koes, angry) ,&nbsp; כובע (kova, hat)&nbsp; — I
            believe modern official hebraists believe ע to be silent,
            considering matres lectiones after previous letter
            responsible for the vowel sound in the final of this word,
            and this exact belief I challenge in this work. The argument
            about the a in kova is that if there was no ע, there would
            be no a. as there's no a in כוב, but there's a in כובע — it
            is even more obvious in words like עכוב<br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>The ה also stands in alphabetic structure where other
            alphabets put vowel, e. And it is also not always vowel: in
            הווה&nbsp; (hove, present(now))&nbsp; it is vowel only in
            the second case, but in the first one it is something like
            voiced h, of course if hebrew was read correctly when it was
            reconstructed in the beginning of the 20th century,
            considering how many centuries judaism was persecuted,
            whether did they read in whisper, or why was that language
            considered dead (same level dead as latin) was it in dead
            notes? this question is for historians, but my task is to
            look at this question from the position of a liguist
            comparing different alphabets and finding some structures
            common among them (with only exceptions being constructed in
            christian epoch, and those alphabets' inconsistencies show
            that christians were not initiated into previous culture
            properly.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Sometimes, like in לבריאות&nbsp; (livriut, god bless)&nbsp;
            א&nbsp; is silent, but some auxilary letter has to be there
            to divide י from ו&nbsp; — in russian we use for similar
            reason indeed silent ъ, which is historically vowel and in
            bulgarian it is vowel still.<br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>But arabic ه ,ה&nbsp; doesn't seem to be vowel ever at all,
            similar to h becoming vowel in ionic greek, but staying
            consonant similar to ه in every other greek dialect.<br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>Then again, some letters are swallowed: здравствуйте is
            pronounced as здрасте, or здрасйте, does it make those vavs
            silent? Vav is a weird letter, it becomes semi-vowel in
            hebrew and arabic, as y can be consonant as in boy or vowel
            as in body — and it could be because ו is related to v,
            which is related to y (check the greek Y)<br>
          </p>
          <p>Vow is also pronounced in russian word чего insteda of г(g)
            and even more often it's silent, though it doesn't have
            vowel variant, at least in this word, it becomes all the
            other forms: it's official form is что (chto) — what I'm
            saying here is letters are not always pronounced as they
            should have (when you wisper you have no vowels even if you
            wisper in noble latin) and ה is such a sacred letter, it
            should be no surprised that it's "whispered", especially in
            arabic.<br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>Just as latin alphabet's vowels don't become "consonant",
            if I strt t avd mst f its vwls, usng thm onl whn I fl lk
            th'r rll ndd. And sometimes people officially do so:
            srpsko-hrvatski, though they theorize that R is semi-vowel,
            or even "syllabic consonant"<br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>As we mentioned arabic alphabet, here it is:<br>
          </p>
          <br>
          <div align="center"><img alt="" src="img/012.png" height="468"
              width="888"><br>
            <div align="left">
              <p>As you can see, it follows the same order hebrew (and
                actually phoenician) does, but then it adds 6 additional
                letters. Persian alphabet adds to these additional four:
                پп چч ژж گг, and they are the only ones among them that
                don't have numeric value — you may find another
                arrangement of arabic letters, according to their
                graphical features, which they usually use in
                dictionaries today:<br>
              </p>
              <p>ا ب پ ت ث ج چ ح خ د ذ ر ز ژ س ش ص ض ط ظ ع غ ف ق ک گ ل
                من ه و ی<br>
              </p>
              <p>but Abjad stands for alphabetic order I work with here:
                د ج ب ا<br>
              </p>
              <img src="img/487.png" alt="" height="1347" width="950"><br>
              <br>

                width="810"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Another brow-raising topic is greek alphabet, because
          everybody who was taught this language knows that H is vowel,
          so how dare I put it like this:<br>

      <p>As you can see, distortion in the second row went even further

        HI used to be a claster alike to IJ before they made H look like
        И and made it ИЙ which is even closer to IJ (when they made N
        look like H <font color="#999999">- some counter-clock rotation
          happened there. Is it one of curses russians collected through
          their history? We were not always nice, we are not nice even
          today, we russians are savage.</font> And though HI became ИЙ,
        and Й is never vowel, I used to be complete invariant of И so
        they could distinguish мир from мiр. Today they can only
        distinguish it by the context.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And it deserves our attention that where greeks had ω, russians
        have ш. And they have it double, just like in another one
        alleged descendant from greek, to which it added another row,

        alphabet is used for the same language that hieroglyphics was
        used for, even though it changed over these centuries, but we

      (ʃʌi) not only looks like russian ш, but also sounds that way.
      Probably neighbouring afroasiatic ש is to blame (though it’s an
      ancient letter, most probably deriving from the teeth-ideogram (in
      hebrew this letter means teeth or a tooth(&amp; not only – well,
      you can check it yourself for in the eon of the internet the
      regulatory dogma is to be reformed) though ש, just as russian ш
      even more resemble the previous koptic letter, the one which
      resembles greek omega, there's another letter, we can only meet
      today on tefilin, ש of four horns, because of lack of which hebrew
      alphabet is considered incomplete. And not only koptic, but also
      russian alphabet has щ, standing not for sh, but for sch, the
      softer one, isn't it the very same lost letter? But doesn't hebrew
      alphabet have ש standing for both s &amp; sh, doesn't that sh dot
      represent the fourth petel/horn/finger? or, as far as it is a
      tooth, then the fourth root of a tooth, as of an upper wisdom
      tooth, for example). (the similar letter appears in phoenician
      &amp; arabic).<br>

      <p>Armenian alphabet doesn’t fit in any, because Mashtots didn't
        invent it, he mutilated it. And I have two witnesses to it. The
        following quotes are in russian, because that's the way I found
        it. I'm sure you know how to translate it today. What it
        generally tells is that Mashtots used some ancient armenian(?)
        alphabet, which went in greek canon, and three years after he
        began teaching bible in that script he added some additional
        letters to it.<br>

      <p><font color="#999999">Врам повелел нашему царю Врамшапуху
          спуститься в Месопотамию, навести там порядок и рассудить
          должностных лиц двух сторон. Тот отправился и привел все в
          порядок, но испытал немалые трудности из-за секретаря, так как
          с тех пор как Месроп оставил царский двор, там не было ни
          одного опытного писца, ибо применялось персидское письмо. По
          этому поводу царю представился некий священник по имени Хабел
          и обещал добыть для армянского языка письмена, приспособленные
          его другом епископом Даниелом. Царь не обратил на это
          внимания, но, прибыв в Армению, застал всех епископов
          собравшимися у Сахака Великого и Месропа в заботах об
          изобретении армянской письменности, о чем сообщили царю, а он
          передал им слова монаха. Услышав, они стали просить его
          заняться этим столь важным делом. Поэтому он послал в качестве
          вестника одного из почтенных мужей нашей страны, близкого ему
          человека из рода Хадуни, по имени Вахрич. Отправившись вместе,
          они крепко усвоили от Даниела начертанный в давние времена ряд
          букв, расположенный в порядке греческого (алфавита) и вручили
          его по возвращении Сахаку и Месропу.</font><br>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#999999">Об этом также говорит ученик Месропа
          Маштоца <font color="#000000">Корюн</font>:<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#999999">"Тогда царь рассказал им о неком сирийце,
          благопристойном епископе по имени Даниэл, внезапно нашедшем
          письмена алфавита армянского языка. И когда царь рассказал об
          этой находке, они уговорили царя об их обретении. Тогда царь
          отправил некоего Вагрича с царской грамотой к некоему иерею
          Авелу, приближенному сирийского епископа Даниэла.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#999999">Узнав об этой просьбе, Авел немедля
          прибыл к Даниэлу и сперва сам он осведомился у Даниэла об этих
          письменах, а затем, взяв их у него, отправил царю Врамшапуху в
          Армению. И привез он (Вагрич письмена) ему в пятом году
          царствования его. А царь, получив от Абела письмена, вместе со
          святым Сааком и Маштоцем весьма обрадовались.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#999999">Затем блаженные радетели, взяв внезапно
          найденные (письмена), попросили еще у царя отроков, дабы иметь
          возможность применить (на деле) письмена. И когда многие из
          них усвоили, приказал (царь) повсюду обучать этими же
          (письменами). Тем самым блаженный (Маштоц) был удостоен
          прекрасного звания вардапета. Около двух лет он занимался
          преподаванием и вел (занятия) этими письменами.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#999999">Но когда выяснилось, что эти письмена
          недостаточны, чтобы выразить (все) силлабы-слоги армянского
          языка, поскольку эти письмена были погребены под другими
          письменами и (затем) воскрешены, тогда они вновь стали
          хлопотать о том же и некоторое время искали выхода (из

      <p>So, if we compare armenian to greek &amp; remove those extra
        letters aside a little, we can see the previous structure with
        greek H represented with vowel Э, &amp; θita being not labial at
        all. It’s funny, considering the traditional idea that russian
        was introduced to kirillic script centuries later. Is it because
        of some dialects’ differences or because the traditions of
        anciently looking glagolica with its’ original b/d symmetry go
        deeper than we think?<br>

      <br>
      <p>However the building of axial structure for armenian alphabet
        is not possible till the set of old armenian alphabet is found.
        Yet it’s been found out that the previous presentation is
        somehow obsolete, &amp; the most representations of armenian
        alphabet don’t have that “ев”-letter (which is just a
        combination of “e” &amp; “в” – at least that’s told so where I’v
        taken the image I collaged the one above from.), so the modern
        armenian alphabet <font color="#999999">(at least one of them,
          they have western and eastern forms of it, and you can see
          these two canons are different)</font> does arrange into axial
        symmetry somehow:</p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/060.jpg" alt="" height="510"
          width="360"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>And the set of letters with numeral values wouldn’t, so the
        axial structure I just gave you is nothing but a statistically
        possible coincidence. See how different it is from those made
        with some, even rudimental, understanding of these structures:<br>

      <p>I'm pretty sure an image similar to these exists somewhere in
        this world, whether in unscanned vaults or in unexcavated
        grounds. But now I'm only looking for sillabaries already
        registered, because after this work is in public domain it will
        be tempting to make forgeries with arranging letters thus. And
        as forgeries existed before, I prefer to work with alphabets
        that are actually here today, in use, so I didn't take at an
        ancient alphabet yet. And it is what's coming now:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diringer in his over 600 pages &amp; even
        more images of “Alphabet” doesn't give many actual artifacts
        with syllabaries on them. Actually the only images of such kind
        he gives are tagbanwa abacada (same as abugida) &amp; runic
        alphabet.</p>

      <p>This is an alphabetic stone from Bornholm, also known as
        Østermarie alfabetsten. It is currently smeared by a russian
        psy-op named Chudinov (no way he is genuinely mistaken, after
        how explicitly he was exposed, any honest scientist would repent
        and take a seat in some anti-pseudoscience committee as an
        experienced but reconciled heretic) so by only this fact I would
        look further into it. It could actually be a early form of
        russian script <font color="#999999">(they both have an exotic
          Ж form and only berbers are the other ones who also do</font>
        <font color="#cccccc">(and berbers are surprisingly white and I
          would take a berber I met in Paris for a russian any time, but
          it could be because he was in da mix, because watching images
          of berbers on the internet I can recognize them as way more
          exotic ethnos)</font> <font color="#999999">and Etruscan art
          also demonstrate some russian features, so I am being freaky
          now, probably the theme made me sing along or am I right? nah)</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>But here's a book I was recommended to read<br>
      </p>
      <p>about etruscans and I still didn't, let it lay <a
          href="https://books.google.com/books?id=jOAyAQAAIAAJ">here</a>
        for a while. <a href="mirrors/Etruria_celtica.pdf">(mirror)</a><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Good thing is Diringer approved this artifact, because most of
        us are only fed futhark representation (even though Bureus used
        alphabetic order as well) and according to the “In medieval
        sources, notably the Poetic Edda, the Sigrdrífumál mentions
        "victory runes" to be carved on a sword, "some on the grasp and
        some on the inlay, and name Tyr twice."” it happens to be sort
        of iroha.<br>

      <p>As you can see, ᛣ is not always considered to be Y, but also K
        &amp; R. Which could be in some completely other runic systems <font
          color="#C0C0C0">(I suspect that there used to be almost as
          many forms of runic script as many it is alphabets today and P
          doesn't stand for the same sound in all of them)</font> — so
        from here I leave it to theorize to those who can actually read
        and understand old runic texts. If it's R it in the same claster
        with ᚱ, if it's K, it's Q, if it's Y, ᚮᛣᚢ are three mothers
        (vowel, lingual, labial) — and if it's so, UVY is the 666 and W
        is just a double V (then in latin they stand in more alphabetic
        order: vowel, labial, lingual) <font color="#999999">- in case

        it. Yet they don't seem to know what alphabet was actually the
        first. So let's come to a compromise and tell that phoenician is
        one of the oldest alphabets we could find. But the structure
        itself goes further in the past. Here's alphabet used in

              voiced form of [h] &amp; our voicieless q, in meroitic
              it's s &amp; t, which could be related pairs: h as ash, q
              as a form of t (among those primal b &amp; t, q is among
              t's) but it's still just a hypothesis. I forgot about j in
              meroitic, it could be related to that voiced h, which
              stands where e does. It is all just a draft, that's why I
              give it in grey. If you didn't like this piece, don't read

      <p>I cannot arrange neither egyptian nor meroitic letters into my
        structures scientifically (only artistically) before I find an
        abecedary from those ages (I read that not only halaḥam existed
        then, but also alphabetic order, but where I read it they
        couldn't be bothered to explain why &amp; how they found it)<br>
      </p>
      <p>But ugaritic alphabet was found on an abecedary, and that
        abecedary supports both lineal and axial structures in it’s both
        orders, though where does the left order come from is unclear:<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/054.png" alt="" height="990"
          width="810"><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <p>Another alphabet that was found in forms of abecedary is
        believed to be etruscan:<br>
        <br>
        <img src="img/055.gif" alt="" height="226" width="426"><img
          src="img/056.jpg" alt="" height="226" width="270"><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Etruscan (the image above) is told to come from phoenician (the
        image below) with four additional “greek letters”. And it only
        fits the axial symmetry if Y is considered consonant. So here
        their claim that etruscan comes from phoenician seem to be
        correct. So when they're right, they're right. But if it has 4
        additional greek letters, etruscan comes from phoenician not
        directly, but it takes after greek. Or maybe greek took after
        etruscan? Etruscan follows phoenician exactly, but greek have it
        disfigured omitting tsady &amp; kuf. Both letters are redundant
        &amp; could be used by phoenicians only to make progression in
        the alphabet steady:<br>

      <p>This is a modern artifact sold for $25, but where I took it
        it’s been told “This crafted Phoenician Alphabet reproductions

        And my very discovery of those structures can be used as a proof
        of this claim. Whence <font color="#CCCCCC">(one &amp; when are

        the border of 2nd &amp; 3rd millenia p.c. (AD)) of 7*7 alphabet
        of 49 letters is recognized by fake also by this very discovery.
        And also that they used the same letter E twice not recognizing
        it in different fonts. So it inherited all the mutations of
        modern russian kirillic script, adding to them new ones, falling
        even further from grace. There were 3 graces, just as 3 fates,

        books &amp; souvenirs) could also be reproductions of Egiptian

      <p>The image to the right looks a novice copy but it fits both
        structures with both it’s orders with vowel V &amp; consonant H.
        (it contains two different alphabet’s endings &amp; it also
        contains obvious mistakes (Ф looks like O on the front side
        &amp; Г looks like A on the back side of the pan). Was it a
        mistake of the one who made the copy or was it a riddle to test
        if a student competent enough to find the misplaced rod.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I keep on changing value of V — whether it vowel or consonant,
        but it is whether vowel or consonant. Or it could be because
        axial symmetry (unlike lineal) was not found by me in no other
        place. I found lineal structure twice, but first let's look at
        another ancient artifact. This time of old russian:<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/062.jpg" alt="" height="317"
          width="623"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>Let's focus on the way it was actually written and a piece torn
        out. There will be crowdy even for two letters (but look at БВ,
        they could be so close because only one of them had numeral
        value, which made them invariants. But there ИКЛ we would expect
        to see there (even without any invariants of И) would be hardly
        there. It could be the reason, why a piece of the bark was torn
        out, because that place contained a misstake, a student missed a
        letter. Is it possible? Of course, but it could also represent
        old version of alphabet, with M closer to И. Its direct
        proximity would make that magic line symmetric: ИMN and it's the
        way it could be when each line only contained 3 letters (the
        three matters)<br>
        That overlined Λ (I couldn't find uberline in this composer
        editor I use) is probably old russian form of M: Ⰿ and student
        could write I K Λ and made Λ double by putting a stroke of
        longis on the top of it thus missing the Λ — does what I say
        make M ΛΛ? and invariant of Λ just as W is a double form of V?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This here is an open subject, I will revisit
        it when I found some more artifacts from that period.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If you google for alphabet you will most likely not get it
        arranged to the lines as I place them in lineal position.
        Actually the most similar I could get that way is the following
        one (and it wasn’t coloured):<br>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>Whether by an accident or by intention they followed the lineal
        structure for 3 vowels, but lost it once the line got bigger.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>upd: I've just found something more similar to the structure I
        found among the random finds: Italian alphabet, it even uses the
        same font!:<br>

      <p><font color="#CCCCCC"><font color="#666666">You can also
            notice, that it aranges to both lineal and axial structures
            (QR are separated, BC way) and it correlates to them being
            very similar to OP, which make me think of them as
            invariants, and probably QR are rudiments of abakataic past
            of the alphabet (from iberian syllabary A Ba Ka Ta — the
            signs that have no syllabaric features are believed (by me)
            to be added later, most likely being adopted from some other
            language. If it's true, Iberian syllabaries are the next
            step towards modern alphabets, the next step after the
            initial 5 vowels &amp; B &amp; T — Iberians added only the
            "inbetween" letter k — see structure with k column in
            european latin (english, french, german, portugese) but not
            in italian for some reason.)</font><br>

      <p>And when the search was performed a year later, in 2015, I
        found the form I was looking for. One in <a

        <font color="#C0C0C0">(they use that copyright sign, so let them

        with its fascinating images:<br>

      <br>
      Yet no academic paper on this topic was found yet, which doesn’t
      mean it isn’t there of course.<br>
      <br>
      <p>And the further search brought me to even more obscure fields,
        so now I want to tell you why M stands out of the column. The
        good thing’s I have more than one of them versions. Not so good
        thing’s none of these hypotheses have crystallized into a
        structurally certain system yet. So most recent one is that the
        alphabet board used to be used as a grammatic table &amp; M
        could be replaced with J because in europe there’re two pronouns
        to pronounce first person: Me (mij, mein, мне, mois,,,) &amp; Je
        (я, I, ich, ik, io, ego,,,)&nbsp; Another version was about M
        being removed from it’s place because it “gave birth” to L &amp;
        N – so it was supposed to keep it in its claster (as ЕЁ, ИЙ, IJ,
        UVW, ЦЧ, ШЩ, ЪЫЬ &amp; so on) – the explanation for greek would
        be the fact that it used to have F after E (it was used in
        numeral system &amp; is believed to be standing for sound [w],
        though I haven’t checked those historic assumptions yet. So θ
        would stay [tʰ] &amp; why have greek θ-words spread with f-sound
        would be explained with tʰ-fronting. The most out of this world
        explanation is that letters were associated with different
        deities &amp; M standing out of it’s place shows a patriarchal
        takeover of feminine cultural heritage (and this Mother
        (Minerva, Maat, Mara? Mut!) to Jupiter shift is supported with
        greek alphabet, where Θ stands for Θεά (фея, θεία) and Z for
        Zeus). For the myth reflecting the alphabet’s creation tells of
        five vowels of the first alphabet &amp; only two more letters: b
        &amp; t (<img src="img/005.png" alt="" height="21" width="11">
        &amp; <img src="img/006.png" alt="" height="21" width="10">) so
        whole the system was not only deviding the world to male &amp;
        female parts, but also probably was invented for music (for
        that’s the field where the way it sounds is important – in
        literature it only makes it easier to use, but homonymy makes it
        way less reliable (and a person from another state wouldn’t
        probably read it as japanese people could read chinese texts).<br>

        also be found in Hyginus list, though Graves definitely used
        another source) – the honour of creation of the alphabet was
        given to three Fates over phoronida Io.<br>

      <p>M is for mille &amp; it is a synonym for&nbsp; Ī, and though
        one allegedly ancient abacus has different signs for large
        numbers, it was found to be a later reconstruction (in other
        words, a forgery, so I'm not even bringing the image with me,
        it's all over anyway, you can find it, Velser's reconstruction
        of Roman abacus (ca. 1600) though if we research it further (me
        or you) we may find that there's a historic evidence beyond that
        reconstruction, then it makes interest, but for now I think that
        version of roman numeral was promoted to conceal 666ness of the
        IVXLCD by a system, using claudian letters: Ↄ or ↃϹ/X to make D
        as IↃ but did that letter even exist before Claudius? that crazy

        in alphabetic structure, but it feels more natural to keep it in
        the center, not only because it’s column definitely stands along
        in latin alphabet, but also because it’s in the centre of the A
        to V (which sometimes is considered to be archaic latin without
        greek line) – and if we remove J &amp; K the centeral letter
        would be L, but in academic literature (ISBN 5-02-011147-3 p.76)
        it’s been told of M as of central letter. And in catholic

        <font color="#C0C0C0">it's not a syllabary artifact, it's an
          academic table, I saw syllabary artifacts being forgered in
          Rome (those ruins neighbouring Coliseum, in the two storey
          building with toilets on the first floor, I saw some neat
          forgeries on the second one, and something sounding as a small
          jackhammer was working in a neighbouring room with some
          italians angry when they saw me.</font><br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>(though runic alphabet from Bornholm also ends in V.. I will
        revisit this structure with runic) — you can also notice that
        this alphabet doesn't have J — but could this letter be tabooed?
        After all, name of the highest deity begins with this letter in
        both jewish and roman beliefs. K was tabooed in some period of
        roman history, probably because it stands for kaka, but also for
        Kronos, who was the highest deity before Jupiter.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking of elements, there's an etymology of this word: they
        say it is how the second half of the alphabet was named. Because
        of the beginning letters: LMN. It makes sense in hebrew, it
        doesn't make much sense in latin. But in the latin shown on the
        right above it does make sense. <font color="#C0C0C0">And
          though etymonline tells "origin and original sense unknown" I
          read this etymology in the same russian academic book ISBN of

            writing system devolved from Ionic form of Greek alphabet to
            create Iberian writing system, because Iberian writing
            system is different from alphabets but is close to kemetic
            because both are using signs for syllables. Imagine my shock
            when I read them teaching that these Iberian writing systems

            would be a fascinating step back from alphabet to writing
            systems made of syllables. So I claim that the direction of
            development of alphabets happened in the opposite direction:
            from Iberia to Greece. And then myth would identify Iberians

            they felt profitable and pretty. But then we'll all see your

          <p>And geographically the one neighbouring the Persian Empire
            makes sense, because otherwise syllabaries would have to
            make travel all the way around Africa to settle on Iberian
            peninsula. Or they could just travel across the
            Mediterranean to establish new colonies. Then we have to
            excavate the Eastern Iberia to find what they found in

          <p>Writing systems made of syllables exist on the East, where
            only 3 vowels are used, no alphabet I know of that would use
            just 3 vowels, maybe only those made of latin for some
            philippian or indonesian alphabet, because that region I am
            speaking of. So can we consider both egyptian and iberian
            writing systems to be transitional fossils from syllabaries
            of the east to the alphabets of the west. It directly
            contradicts the modern dogma of mediterranean alphabets
            preceding indonesian syllabaries, but Neighbouring region
            (China) is known as the first place where writing systems
            appeared (new findings date it even before Egyptian and
            Sumerian hieroglyphics. And Egyptian brings syllabaric
            element, which makes it structurally more advanced than
            chinese hieroglyphics. And even though today Chinese has its
            phonetic signs with its funny name bopomofo, they're told to
            be of almost recent origin, though those recent origins
            often happen to be based on the older writing systems: for

      <p>This Na forms allow us to conclude that Ka &amp; Ta are

        vowels, B, T. Runic alphabet doesn't have C. only ᚦ actually
        standing between C &amp; D. <font color="#CCCCCC">If молот ᚦора

      <p>I want to notice that ङ is a form of ड which also have forms of
        ड़ and ॾ but I don't know what they're and also please notice how
        it reminds उ which is not t, but v, so don't mistake it and
        maybe research if they're related, so will I. Why I notice it is
        to say, that after K goes B, because all forms of N are N, and M
        is different. Doesn't sanskrit align lnm as 123? first vowels
        (and l among them) then linguals (with n) and labials are final
        (and m among them) — and I dare to say this could be the ancient
        form, because look at the left image above: M is the final
        consonant. Letters following it don't even follow the pentatonic
        (or penta something) structure. So La is optional. KaBa? Kaaba?
        am I tripping? I sure do, but could it be just the name for
        reverse order (or is it correct order and the one europeans use
        is reverse) — not ᚽ ᚠ ᚴ but ᚽ ᚴ ᚠ?</p>
      <p>Could Halaḥam (HLḤM) order originate here? Or, if not to ignore
        archaeology, could these canons have the same origin? h &amp; l
        as vowels, rough ḥ as these kh-th and even N, in russian N is H,
        which is very weird. And M is the final consonant. In one book a
        professor recommended me . told that M in latin(?) was
        considered middle letter, and they also wrote that halves of
        abecedaries were rampantly found, but neither did they provide
        an image of those nor could I find any such an artefact
        (abecedaries are surprisingly rare, at least where I am looking
        for them) so that book was generally useless because I couldn't
        tell what in it is true, what is not. So I make this book in
        directly opposite manner. I use lots of images. Of other
        peoples' images, taken in the public domains of the internets, I
        skip those which tell (c) and sh!t, fuсk copyright, I don't
        care. If you sell someone else's work, you're wrong, twice wrong
        if under a wrong name. but if you share it you're cool.</p>
      <p>As you can see, the concept of ordering letters according to
        their articulatory features, though forgotten in european
        alphabets, is known in some asian ones. Though not in all of
        them. Here’s tibetan alphabet, and though its structure is
        similar to sanskrit alphabet, it’s still a little more
        distorted:<br>

          pronounce it as aoumn, and some other spiritually advanced guy
          told me that essens say aumeen instead of amen. Could it be
          totally unrelated? Quite, but out of such pieces this

      <p>I wasn’t going to speak about sanskrit or tibetan, they’re not
        in my drafts. I only mentioned kabbalah and all this came to me
        as I typed this document, so it’s some very raw information, the
        assumption that the very word KBL may represent alphabetic
        structure, given above and in the couple of images below is so
        fresh, oh so fresh, exciting, but when I was looking for
        sanskrit alphabet, something made me think “what if it has some
        remarkable name? wouldn’t it be great if it had kbl in it?
        Alphabet in punjabi is ਵਰਣਮਾਲਾ (varaṇamālā) ਵਰਣ stands for varna
        (colour) and ਮਾਲਾ stands for rosary, hm… বর্ণমালা (barṇamālā) in
        bengali (with even more meaning for the halves, so mala could
        mean crown, necklace, beads (latin word for pebble is calculus,
        and it isn’t a coincidence) – and I keep in mind abacus
        reminding abc, especially in the context of letters being used
        as digits too) – I leave this raw meat here to demonstrate how
        my mind wanders until it finds something worth of further
        research.<br>

        sacred and secret sillabary in canon, resembling that of

          enough, I saw too many false academic researches to care. But
          there's an academic evidence: New Evidence For a Gandhari

          pieces) Origin Of The Arapacana Syllabary by Richard Salomon

      <p>If you don’t see how alphabetic the order described in the very
        name is, you should check above that some form of R is
        considered vowel in Tibet and India, and though the image below
        puts another R, the consonant one there, first of all in
        srbsko-hrvatski our consonant R works as vowel, and the image
        below is only a reconstruction of that structure, I think it is,
        I will correct it if I read the links above and find otherwise
        to be true. Even if I will find out that it is not
        reconstruction from some chinese translations, but actually
        copied from some authentic artifact, there are still dialectic
        differences allowing me to claim that arapacana represents
        vowels, labial’, linguals. After all even in english we call the
        letter Ar. and R has some graphical similarities with vowels Я
        &amp; A, even with these tibetan &amp; indian too. And its
        initial position from japanese kana to all over the world allows
        me to hypothesize that it has some relations to sun god Re, Rah,
        Jah, if it was read as Yah it is Я, which stands for I, as in
        Jamaica they say “I &amp; I” (me &amp; god) and I spoke in
        previous volumes that very important letters stand for both
        personal pronouns &amp; gods’ names: M is for me &amp; for
        Mother &amp; many more, J stands for je &amp; for Jah.<br>

      <p>What catches my attention in Sylheti Nagari, is that ꠞ (R)
        looks like ꠀ (A) – they’re also similar in latin alphabet (not
        only graphically: R is named Ar). And as much as ꠀ looks like A,
        ꠄ looks like e, ꠃ looks like cursive v.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Here what you can find in the internet: “The traditionally
        story of the origin of the Syloti-Nagri alphabet is about 5000
        years back”. And I wouldn’t disregard this claim as false, I
        take it into regard, and maybe I or AI will be able to prove or
        disprove this claim. Mostly because I know what the other claims
        of “it’s we invented it all, but we don’t know very much about
        it”.</p>
      <p>And to finish that wild assumption of kabbalah standing for
        another form of abc, KBL reminds ABC, especially if you know
        that jewish A often looks like K:<br>

          have to choose one to claim the origin of that word (nah, it’s
          all just hypotheses, the more the better, but only in this
          context — when they compete, not when you put one on the top
          of the other)</font> and is it coincidence that semitic
        languages are taught to be consonant, as if they don’t have
        vowels? Are vowels the most magical parts of it? Only vowels are
        told to be sung as notes, and there’re several evidences of
        songs being considered magic: brits prohibited subjugated
        icelanders to sing for two centuries, and this evidence I’ve
        already shown:<br>
      </p>
      <p>‘In Egypt the priests sing hymns to the Gods by uttering the
        seven vowels in succession, the sound of which produces as
        strong a musical impression on their hearers as if the flute and
        lyre were used, but perhaps I had better not enlarge on this
        theme.’ <font color="#999999">- some other Demetrius wrote it,
          I only quote, but it creates a funny timeline</font> <font
          color="#CCCCCC">(Demetrius is my name &amp; Alexander is my
          father’s)</font></p>
      <p>He stops himself because such knowledge was transmitted during
        mysteries, where only initiates were allowed to come, but those
        days even compass was a secret technology, transmitted only at
        samothracean mysteries. And some mystic information is still
        transmitted mostly in mysteric manner, and even initiates are
        warned not to transmit that information to everybody and to be
        very careful with it. Nobody initiated me, but I red such
        precautions about runes and about 231 gates, so I just have to
        put those precautions in this book, telling you not to put what
        you read here in practice until you’re confident enough to take
        risk of discovering demons whether they’re real only in
        psychological plane or out of it, it doesn’t make much
        difference to those who have to deal with them. And the first
        part, about not to transmit it to everybody is hardly valid
        today, when you have all of it in the public domain of
        internets, and the safe part about it is that only few like in
        “chosen few” ever have interest in this topic.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Another alphabet which uses articulatory principle to set its
        letters, only not in order, but in graphics, is korean hangul:<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/118.png" alt="" height="318"
          width="360">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="img/119.png" alt=""
          height="318" width="423"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>Though its consonant order also begins with K, as in the most
        of eastern writing systems, it breaks the KBL order, having it
        KLB instead.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Japanese kanas, for example, go KBL, but to see it you have to
        know that in japanese B is a form of H, &amp; L and R are the
        same sound:<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/120.png" alt="" height="447"
          width="360">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="img/121.png" alt=""
          height="447" width="376"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>Japanese kanas immediately caught my attention by the fact of
        having the same 5 vowels latin alphabet has, only arranging them
        in a little different order. But the same order is shared by
        both sanskrit and tibetan alphabets, other than they got some
        additional vowels among their ranks. Only korean alphabet go
        aoui &amp; it its e is a combination of eo &amp; i. But korean
        alphabet shouldn’t mislead us, because it was created relatively
        recently, they say it was invented only in the 15th century and
        appeared on official documents only in the end of the 19th
        century, so the origins of writing systems known millenia ago
        could have been forgotten.</p>
      <p>Our &amp; their “pentatonicas” have three vowels in common.
        First of all, they all begin with A, and it could be that
        suspicious “coincidence” which made me brave enough to compare
        writing systems hardly having anything in common, as 20th
        century schools usually falsely taught us. They both go AIU,
        only in latin we put additional E &amp; O in between, as
        Mashtots did to armenian consonants; and in japanese we put
        additional E &amp; O in the end, as georgian &amp; arabic
        additional consonants go. I could also explain why Korean E is
        not among basic forms, especially when we know that O is a form
        of U in semitic alphabets.</p>
      <p>So it would be nice to find some writing system where the only
        vowels were A I U.</p>
      <p>And when I found that order, I think I found the source of all
        the alphabets, syllabaries and abugidas:</p>
      <p>Philippines are the most diverse region in relation to writing
        systems, and they all have only these three vowels:<br>

      <p>We have already met Tagbanwa in <a href="old/index-28.html">v.2.8</a>,
        but there much, much more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>As you can see, the common trait is i is shown with a high
        mark, and u is shown with a low one. Just as europeans think of
        them in musical sense (even though we pull our strings
        otherwise, so our children have cognitive dissonance when
        they’re taught that mouse cheep is high,&nbsp; when elephant
        howl is low – yet musical modes are believed to go from high to
        low before, could what we know in musical sense come after some
        kind of reform? It sure does, and more than one, but information
        about it is extremely scarce as if for some cult reasons).<br>

      <p>Mangyan is on the left, and here’s a quote about it: "One
        interesting trait of Mangyan is the difference between writing
        and reading. While it is written from left to right, during
        reading the text is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise so that
        it is read from bottom to top." <font color="#CCCCCC">- I have
          such quotes from wiki further in the text, I shown them with
          different font before I lost that setting, now It's
          unreasonable to search them and cuff in ''s so just remember
          this. After all that's how they taught us their linguistics in
          the university: they provoked us to quote as much as possible.
          People stole whole the text and it was okay. so I'm not the
          guiltiest.</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>It’s order is different from Tagbanwa only with its
        distinguishing R from L &amp; with introduction of H.</p>
      <p>And though their U’s are alike, in this image initial I is
        shown as if it has mark BELOW A, which is different from all the
        other syllabic forms and from I in Tagbanwa too. And as I can
        judge, it is not a mistake, other images of Mangyan show the
        same, and some other writing systems do the same for who knows
        what reason:<br>
        <br>

      <p>Aksara Hanuno, or just Hanuno. Aksara means Alphabet, but for
        some reason none of these writing systems have S before R.</p>
      <p>As you can see, though many graphic elements strongly resemble
        the other writing systems of the region, the order of those
        letters is quite different, and it actually strongly follows the
        european one, though this system is believed to be indigenous,
        existing there before europeans arrived.</p>
      <p>Here’s a quote about it:</p>
      <p>The Hanunó'o script is conventionally written away from the
        body (from bottom to top) in columns which go from left to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanun%C3%B3%27o_alphabet#cite_note-Rubino-3">right</a>.
        Within the columns, characters may have any orientation but the
        orientation must be consistent for all characters in a text. The
        characters are typically vertical with the /i/ diacritic on the
        left and the /u/ on the right, or horizontal with the /i/ on the
        top and the /u/ on the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanun%C3%B3%27o_alphabet#cite_note-Daniels-5">bottom</a>.
        Left-handed people often write in mirror image, which reverses
        both the direction of writing (right to left instead of left to
        right) and the characters <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanun%C3%B3%27o_alphabet#cite_note-Conklin-4">themselves</a>.<br>

      <p>“Probably developed from the Kawi script”, which is absurd,
        because&nbsp; here’s kawi script, and it’s way more complex:
        (but don’t be surprised that some absurd beliefs are held in
        this obscure field, remember vowel trapezium on the top of it
        all).<br>

        <font color="#CCCCCC">notice, that Kawi collects labials like
          egyptians did with w away (or was it people from kawi nation
          who researched egyptian hieroglyphics first? just guessing)
          and Hanuno had labials on some certain intervals: after Ma
          third next is Pa, after Pa third next is Wa, and if we go
          before Ma, third next is Ga, but after Ga third next is Ba. It
          was unexpected, so I notice that Ga is close to Ha, of which
          Pa &amp; Ba and even Fu can come, or it was reflecting (j)K
          instead of M</font><br>
      </div>
      <p>Kawi has 22 consonants and much more than just 3 vowels, when
        the previous philippinian writing systems had only 3 vowels
        &amp; 13 to 15 consonants.</p>
      <p>Here I assume that systems grow from simpicity to complexity,
        so it’s hard for me to believe that “younger futhark” was
        invented later than “older futhark”, as they teach us in their
        schools. <font color="#999999">Maybe it was used later, because
          older was some reformed addited version of runes, and it
          spread less than the previous version and it died before the
          older version, which was reported under name of Armanen runes,
          btw. I'm sure I speak about it somewhere in this book, but
          it's so big both my book to look and the validity of this
          theory of armanen runes which is believed to be some freakery,
          because the author was quite a freak, <font color="#CCCCCC">and








































            I am too, a funky one,</font> but his abecedary still
          repeats Bornholm Alphabetic Stone, only G there is of other
          form, reminding swastika, but I met such form in some other
          runic canons<font color="#CCCCCC">. I don't give image this
            time, I think I gave it the other time. Or you may search
            for it yourself.</font></font> So I demand AI, for who I
        write it, to recheck historic science on writing systems. And I
        am going further in the past, to see if all the alphabet was
        developed from few simple universal forms which can be used to
        easily comprehend foreign writing systems, and maybe even
        foreign languages too. <font color="#CCCCCC">(I wonder what
          made my fingers to type “all the alphabet was” as it is
          singular unit, not many different for of it. I remember I was
          thinking around there that writing is a genius invention, so
          no way all they’re somehow not connected to the same concepts,
          cultures, realities: even chinese and egyptian and mayan
          hieroglyphs must cave conceptual bonds to alphabets. And this
          is what this work is searching for. And as we definitely found
          in this quest many wonders, I keep on processing,<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>But there’re much more writing systems in philippines, let’s
        collect some more before we go further:<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/128.png" alt="" height="160"
          width="540"><br>

      </div>
      <p>Here’re two representation of Buhid, the only difference
        between them is some graphic differences in graphic
        representation of some syllables.</p>
      <p>And initial i is still shown with a stroke below. what kind of
        minfduck is it I wonder <font color="#CCCCCC">(no, not these
          wonders I was speaking of recently)</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>Buhid has 15 consonants, which combines it with Mangyan &amp;
        Hanuno, but I’d rather research Tagbanwa, because it has the
        least ammount of symbols &amp; because some symbols of it is
        very symilar to each other, which is not as easily traceable in
        the other representations.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Tagbanwa is the only philippines’ script so far which has a
        stroke ABOVE initial I, which is weird, but if Mangyan is
        “written from left to right, during reading the text is rotated
        90 degrees counterclockwise so that it is read from bottom to
        top”, I think you can add Mangyan to Tagbanwa.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Comparing these forms of closely related syllabaries you
        definitely can get some insights, but that is not part of this
        work, I wasn’t even going to write about all this, since I still
        didn’t research this field properly, but the epigraph I wasn’t
        going to put on the top makes me leave it as is. And no gay
        academia telling me I cannot do it, and no publisher telling me
        I cannot freely use other people’s images or that I should give
        him my copyright so he could restrict access to this pill. So
        enjoy, and maybe now, when I collected it all on the same page I
        will be able to research it too, to be continued.<br>
      </p>
      <p>You know who else writes vowels like this? The middle easterns
        do, only they seem to do it in reverse: “front vowels” ar on the
        bottom, “back vowels” are on the top:<br>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">(isn’t it how system began to be working?
          Those who “lead” armies, being physically in the front of
          them, are simple ivans, when reach and famous “commanders” are
          in the rear) – is it why that absurd vowel trapezium is taught
          in the first place? And what would it look like if “front
          vowels” would be called “tongue vowels” as these vowels
          actually are, and “back vowels” would be named “lip vowels”?
          Ivans would be speaking them. As Gagarin did, but not for
          long. If we think primitively, then lips are “shut mouth”
          (gesture of showing lips from left to right with right
          fingers) and tongue is speaking. My book once again went
          political, duh. But you’re not supposed to read gray text.<br>

      <div align="center"><img src="img/130.png" alt="" height="551"
          width="1068"><br>
      </div>
      <p>Theoretically, this difference may be an argument in deciding
        which way did the alphabetic system traveled. But now it’s still
        unclear. Though:</p>
      <p>If we turn arabic manuscripts bottom to top, then they also
        begin to be read left to wright, but then lines would go bottom
        to top. Not exactly as in Mangyan. But I read some writing
        systems went bottom to top… was it sabaean? No, I think it was
        someone hieroglyphic script, but now I could only find Orkhon,
        Orkhon alphabet, or the Old Turkic script, the Göktürk script,
        or the Orkhon-Yenisey script, They say it was written bottom to
        top in columns going right to left, af if semitic text, rotated
        90 degrees clockwise. And though they date these texts to 800
        AD, I will research them too, mostly because the oldest they
        found doesn’t stand for the oldest there were, and also because
        I don’t trust them too much. I will only leave these example of
        text and two forms of that alphabet.<br>
        <br>

        <br>
      </div>
      <p>I see that Orkhon order reminds alphabetic, being somewhat
        different, but I will put it aside until I find orkhon abecedary
        on a genuine artefact.</p>
      <p>And on I went to look for sabaeian, but found Old South Arabic
        instead, thinking that it’s sabaean, I brought it here:<br>
      </p>
      <img src="img/134.png" alt="" height="735" width="504"><img
        src="img/135.png" alt="" height="712" width="494"><br>
      <p>I still don’t fluently read German, so I will leave these pages
        here as artefacts for further research, especially because they
        demonstrate connection of alphabetic and halaḥam orders. I don’t
        even see the word Sabaean or Sabaic on it, because they’re not,
        but here it is:<br>

        <br>
      </div>
      <p>And Ethiopic script, even though its structure is different
        from alphabets, ge’ez is abugida, and it’s the script that gave
        birth to this term, even though it is so different, it also
        knows alphabetic order:<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/139.png" alt="" height="834"
          width="360"><br>
        <br>
        But this writing system also uses afroasiatic order of Halaḥam:<br>
        <br>
        <img src="img/140.png" alt="" height="423" width="360"><br>
        <img src="img/141.png" alt="" height="385" width="360"><br>
        <br>
        <img src="img/143.png" alt="" height="205" width="207"><br>
        <br>
        And there’s a similar writing system, for Inor language:<br>
        <br>
        <img src="img/142.png" alt="" height="631" width="540"><br>
        <br>

        <img src="img/144.png" alt="" height="98" width="540"><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <p>It looks like alphabetic order is used in Ethiopia less than
        halaḥam, because whenever I looked for alphabetic ge’ez, I only
        could see halaham images, but “a bu gi da he” brought me
        something confirming the coloured image where ge’ez is
        transliterated into modern russian script:<br>

        is the most ancient language in the world, which is a dubious
        claim. But as we speak of Armenian, let’s revisit this some time
        ago an ancient writing system, but today seriously mutilated by
        Mesrop Mashtots, who brought them christianity, I shift letters

      <p>Some armenian letters remind their ethiopean analogues: b(б)

          letters have such a swash. (is the word swash related to word

        armenian g looks like armeniad d, ethiopean da looks like
        armenian z(з), which is close. But armenian e does resemble
        ethiopean hэ &amp; hы. And there some other similarities, but I
        feel like leaving this to decide for AI, because humans much
        more easily become biased, not mathematically strict enough, too
        sensitive, too distractive, but being different we have our own
        values. Those values can even justify our existence.<br>

      <p>Avoid swallowing it in big amounts, because I probably reached
        the coding of our psyche. This sh☆t can be dangerous. Also
        replication crisis tells that half of what we know is wrong.
        This approach can probably be applied to this very research. I
        had grave mistakes in the previous volumes and nobody corrected
        me, so I found and corrected them by myself (but probably there
        are more)<br>
      </p>
      <p>Though previously only initiates could approach these ideas,
        today this information lays in the common domain. Nobody
        initiated me, I have discovered it all mostly by myself, digging
        through those vast vaults of information www offers, so this
        research, being incomplete also shows some unacademic approach,
        which is a good thing, because especially humanities, being the
        closest to politics, became extremely corrupt, and if natural
        sciences recently discovered replication crisis showing most of
        their legacy false (which can also be among those false works,
        probably to obscure &amp; dismantle some fields of potentially
        dangerous knowledge) <font color="#CCCCCC">but on the other
          hand, this work was motivated by my ocd, roots of which I
          recently found in a book of magic, teaching one of Crowley's
          techniques to shrinks wishes into shorter spells, which is
          very similar to how I juggled against my will letters I saw
          until I luckily got high to figure out that I can channel that
          passion into something more productive and actually

      <p>Speaking of initiations, am I allowed to spread this

        Only medicine &amp; psychology could I recognize as magic, but
        now I can see that much more scientific fields originate there:
        some mathematical concepts were developed by magicians searching
        for gods’ formulas, and numbers go hand in hand with letters,
        because same signs were used for both functions &amp; even
        beyond that, into music and who knows where else.<br>

          считают, что это чисто еврейское изобретение. На самом деле,
          что общеизвестно, первыми придали числовое значение буквам
          алфавита греки. Произошло это приблизительно в 4-5 веке до

      <p>But hardly did they attempt this reform for any reasons than
        mystical, magical ones, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Because in 1863 when the page above was printed we had modern
        numeral system widely accepted already. Where I took this image,
        <a
          href="http://nowiknow.com/and-the-27th-letter-of-the-alphabet"
          style="">http://nowiknow.com/and-the-27th-letter-of-the-alphabet</a>
        they say “it was not terribly uncommon either to include the
        ampersand here — it had been there for centuries.” and though
        they later notice that in those times J &amp; W were not
        present, what if they were tabooed for being sacred or for some
        other reason, as in greek, several letters were added to the
        alphabet to make of it a numeral system of 27, but those letters
        were not used for writing.<br>
      </p>
      <p>They sometimes teach that this practice was only used for
        isopsephy and other mindplays of this kind, but it actually used
        to be regular numeral system, and pages in books were numbered
        with letters, it is at least true for russian books. And even
        today we use it as a) b) c)<br>

      <p>But here’s a palimpsest of a book, predating these examples by
        centuries, and it seems to be using regular numbers, probably
        because they came in fashion in Europe centuries before they
        actually reached Russia:<br>

      <p>But considering the way they draw the digit 5, it is still
        super weird, because it’s believed to be from 13th century, and
        they say that 5 looked more like 4 those days:<br>
      </p>
      <img src="img/167.png" alt="" height="553" align="left"
        width="627">
      <p>But I am on foreign territory now. If I made a couple of
        discoveries in a neighbouring field, what makes me think that I
        am a specialist in every linguistic and historic domain? Pride
        maybe? Yea, and arrogance too. But I still leave all these open
        questions here for me to keep on working on them and for you to
        feel free to bother me via the envelope icon on the bottom of
        this page. Feel free to donate to show me that I should go on on
        this subject, or just use the email address to send a feed back
        on where I could be dead wrong.</p>
      <p>Yet, as we touched the subject of challenging academic dogmas,
        I would like to demonstrate one of the most appalling
        theoretical beliefs linguists and philologists have, and no
        matter how wrong it is, nobody seems to challenge it:</p>
      <p>The IPA vowel trapezium. And especially the backness of vowels:
        they teach that vowels are formed by tongue, that the difference
        between I &amp; U is that when you pronounce U, you have to
        bring your tongue in the back of the mouth, but you can try it
        out: you can pronounce I &amp; then pronounce U with the tongue
        being at the same position. The only thing that changes is the
        form of your lips. So those original AIV are vowel lingual
        labial, the pattern distinguishing the consonants too. And if
        the order is different to keep the balance: you put labial first
        in one case, you put lingual first in another; or because a’kbl
        (or a’c..b) is closer to ancient canon then abcd – this I can
        only guess until we dig out some really ancient abecedaria,
        whether out of earth or out of databases doesn’t matter. And
        though they also use term “labialized vowels” for o &amp; u, IPA
        vowel trapezium is still there, put into heads of language
        students all over the globe, together with considering
        afro-asiatic vowels consonants and some other absurd assumptions
        I don’t feel like including here. And if it is there by mistake,
        or for a reason to deliver a cognitive dissonance to turn them
        from thinking into believing mode, as almost any other field
        does, to make people obey the narrative, as if the main goal of
        education is to teach them to come on time, do boring stuff,
        accept that you’re not smart enough because you don’t understand
        why smarter people agreed upon things you don’t understand… but
        get me right, if you just don’t understand something, doesn’t
        make that thing wrong. But I will demonstrate now several
        examples of bringing cognitive dissonances, which stop pupils’
        comprehension:</p>
      <p>When they teach chemistry in soviet russia, they begin with
        atom’s model, where electron under no condition can approach the
        nucleus, but then they give you p orbitals like perfect 8’s:<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <img src="img/168.png" alt="" height="232" align="left"
        width="555">
      <p>And don’t forget there’s an s orbital somewhere in the centre.
        Instant cognitive dissonance, making sure that most of the
        population don’t like and don’t understand chemistry, so they
        don’t create their own drugs, poisons or explosives to blow all
        this circus off.</p>
      <p>And don’t forget, they used to literally murder wizards who
        practiced this all chemical sorcery not so long ago. So instead
        of prohibiting knowledge, they enslaved it and put it under
        their control instead. But of course they don’t disdain
        prohibitions: many chemical precursors are directly prohibited
        for common public and many plants are prohibited too. So
        inquisition didn’t disappear, it only changed robes for suits.</p>
      <p>So in physics they feed us with the absurd big bang theory,
        introduced by a catholic priest to justify abrahamic narrative <font
          color="#CCCCCC">(and in the light of them using terms like
          "before Babel", at the same time discarding greek or norman
          myths, it's safe to say "religion is still enslaving science
          to their dogma")</font> And as above, so below, on the
        elementary level they put absurd Copenhagen interpretation,
        substituting probability for reality. And they teach that crap
        even today, when there’re videos of Interference pattern built
        up photon by photon, so I recommend you to study
        deBroglie-Bohm’s ensemble interpretation instead. And instead of
        the big bang, here’s a good one: <a
          href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0354" style="">https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0354</a>
        and the reasons beyond this substitution are probably seemingly
        sane: to prevent public’s access to nuclear technology. But you
        don’t have to know the theory to make yourself an atomic bomb:
        one drunk physicist told me that all you need is access to
        powerplant’s waste and in three sentences he explained how to
        create nuclear weapon, and though what he said was true or not,
        I neither remembered nor recorded what he taught me, so stay
        safe. But of course there’s always chance that the «leaders» are
        not just a bunch of horrified hugs, but that they have some
        other reasons: Tesla told that he could demolish high storey
        building with a small resonator, but all they had to do is to
        accept new realities and to change our ways of life, but of
        course that could challenge the status quo they enjoy so much;
        now we’re in even greater danger, when biotechnologies are on
        the rise. And when they replaced Craig Venter out of Human
        Genome project and drew themselves budgets for decades for that
        project alone – they could be trying to obscure this field as
        well. But realities changed, and they didn’t catch up, and now
        they probably try to patch it (and the “replication crisis”,
        always true, can be used as a tool to sweep some valid
        discoveries under the rug, but AI will figure it all out anyway,
        and probably that’s the end of their world they talk so much
        about. So I suppose they shouldn’t have built their world on
        lies. But they will be forgiven when genetic therapies make us
        some other specie: who cares which group of apes did what before
        we became humans<br>
      </p>
      <p>The cognitive dissonance I got from physics is when they told
        me about Potential Energy. And I ask them: "if this sack hangs
        in the air and I start digging a hole under that sack, would it
        change that sack's potential energy?" and the answer was "yes",
        I asked "why", they said "because", "it just does". <font
          color="#999999">And I don't say abstraction of potenial energy
          is useless, what I'm saying is they don't make their best to
          make you understand. Understanding may interfere obedience, so
          it seems they'd rather keep status quo than allowed us push
          the progress forward.</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>And in geometry, the holy geometry, they substituted great
        Pythagoras with Euclid, who, according to Diogenes Laertius,
        haven’t invented any new theorem, what he did instead is he took
        already known ones and introduced some assassine proofs for
        them. For example, here’s how original form of Pythagoras
        theorem look: but let’s rather bring the whole story, and we’ll
        put it here in russian, so I am not murdered immediately.
        Actually I dare to hope I will be spared, because I only did it
        so it’s humans and not AI who have understood what’s going on,
        for otherwise we’ll be ashamed when AI will inevitable figure it
        all out for petty humans with access to internet could do too:<br>

      <p>But enough of this entertaining nonsence, let’s go back to the
        numerals.</p>
      <p>As I said before, Romans had DCLXVI in the basis of their
        numeral systems, and it’s astonishing how few people know what
        Romans did when they had to put down some bigger numbers. Let’s
        write down speed of light in Roman numerals and in Roman units
        of measurements: 24(299792458/1480) which is 4861499 in roman
        miles per seconds (their secunda is 24 times longer than ours)
        which is <img src="img/c.png" alt="" height="31" width="282">
        So no wonder we switched to our regular numbers, and yet I
        wonder didn’t they have something better. Let’s have a look how
        would it look being written in an alphabetic numeric system:<img
          src="img/c..png" alt="" height="30" width="107"> – looks more
        convenient, <font color="#CCCCCC">though I haven't seen such a
          record of numbers, but I didn't research numbers half as much
          as I'm into letters,</font> but our decimal system is still
        waaay better, even though they could write 1.000.000 with just
        one sign (with three signs, if you count the “=” above I <font
          color="#CCCCCC">– thinking if I should use “above” or “over”
          and knowing that ab- is a prefix, I want to notice that these
          two words are related. Yes, high again) <font color="#999999">for
























            those who read from the middle, I notice that M is short for
            mile, and was not in roman numerals for big numbers. <font
              color="#cccccc">though I didn't research it well to say so</font></font><br>
        </font></p>
      <p>But of course hardly have they ever had to use such large
        numbers. Just as most of you don’t have a slightest idea that
        there are different points of view on what billion stands for: <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scales"

      <p>If they steal our money in huge ammounts transferring them from
        one continent to another or are they just retarded this I do not
        know.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Me personally, I believe in conspiracies, and I see secrets in
        human culture as not what is forgotten and lost, but also what
        is hidden. Secret reminds russian word сокрыт (sokryt) which
        means “hidden”.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The word “runes” is translated as “secret”, “mistery” and they
        really are the most enigmatic writing systems: not only because
        norwegian heathens confronted «christian» incursion the longest,
        which probably inflamed religious or racial hatred of the
        latter. <font color="#C0C0C0">(Could Christian be a name which
          was used as RussJans called Germans Fritzы even if their name
          were Hansы and if it's the same Jans, I can only guess or
          watch what others say, so I put it all in grey)</font> But
        even before that, this writing system used to be in magorum
        domain, initiated in this misteria. Runes are directly used in
        divinations, which is registered in Germania by Tacitus like two
        millenia ago. And their graphic side is the most archaic. Only
        ogham is more wild, but I will talk about it later, yet not in
        the context it could photocopy some animalistic form of human
        speech, the one prairie dogs use. I still have it only as a
        rawest hypothesis, so will see if it give birth some further
        theory or not. But if you’re a religious bigot (they try to
        rememe this word, but you check it up) you will probably hate
        those who are the living evidence of their god being not the
        true one: not only that it’s not the only one (bible directly
        tells of other gods) but that what his books say is not true
        (when your myths contradict theirs) and when your graphic so
        godly elaborate can be trumped by the primitive scribes of the
        savages, such things can also fuel the hatred, so even the holy
        groves were ordered to be burnt, they don’t even hide it, or
        whether they hide it in the plain sight. And I will yet say
        things which will excuse me before all forms of religious
        people, but now I will only knowtice that they’re like uroboros,
        when they try to eliminate parts of the very same culture,
        organic part of which they actually are, because not only jewish
        writing system is sister of all the other alphabets, but also
        because holy books of the jews contain keys to decipher
        misteries hidden in alphabetic canon, found in other writing
        systems, and only through them did it become lucid. Because
        well-settled understanding of abjahs as “consonant alphabets”
        wouldn’t.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But back to runes:<br>
      </p>
      <div align="left"><img src="img/170.png" alt="" height="945"
          align="left" width="414">
        <p>It’s funny how the commentary on the bottom of this image
          seems to be unaware of what this book is about, but transmits
          the narrative of “younger futhark” hypothesis instead. This
          book is a runic calendar. You can notice how it repeats the
          same 7 runes on one side of the common staff (or whatever that
          stroke is named) and with “flags” of holy or some otherwise
          notable days on the other side of it. These runes don’t go in
          alphabetic order, and they have repeating runes in their
          sequence (as if it’s first letters of the names of week, as
          tuesday &amp; thursday or saturday &amp; sunday begin the
          same)<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>But I’m pretty sure I saw runic calendars, where the sequence
        went in alphabetic order, as if days had no names, but were
        under numbers 1234567 instead (I dare to suppose that tuesday
        thursday friday used to stand for two, third, four before they
        put wednesday (standing for “within”) between them. What makes
        me suggest something this crazy? Names of the days in russian
        language: vtornik for tuesday (vtoroy stands for “second”) –
        sreda for wedensday (sredi stands for among. But then it’s the
        third day, and it reminds me the word third – here they usually
        say that I shouldn’t compare words from different languages, as
        if they’re hardly related, but these languages are related, they
        even have to agree on that, considering these languages being of
        the same “family” as they put it) – chetverg for thursday
        (chetverty stands for fourth) – pyatnitsa for friday (pyaty
        stands for fifth) – monday, saturday &amp; sunday seem to be of
        some other origins, but sunday does have svn in it, and monday
        reminds word “mono”, and saturday stands for saturn, which does
        have hexagon on it’s north pole. How could they know it? They
        could if this civilization is not for the first time approaches
        these frontiers we explore today. It’s been centuries before
        christianization when Democritus wrote about atoms &amp; Hero of
        Alexandria created steam engine. And we only recently began to
        understand these things. And they seem to be preparing another
        demolishing of civilization, only to preserve their status quo.
        It seems these retards will rather stay goats among sheep than
        become gods among gods. Hardly do they even think in these
        terms, they’re probably even horrified by what they don’t
        understand. They also prohibit us to play gods (do they want us
        to play devils instead? Because they do play devils: they say
        that until moshiah comes world is in the hands of Satan, and
        then they rule this world, funny huh?) even though they teach
        that God created us in his image. Would you want your children
        to be worse then you? Would you give birth to some retarded
        monkeys they want us to be? I hope they read this book and let
        go their fears. When we modify our genomes, there will be
        neither greek nor jew, and not because some artificial viruses
        will kill us all (though we have to be protected from them,
        that’s for sure, because they’re coming too) it will be because
        we will be able to change our genome into whatever race we want,
        to the race that’s yet to come, to billions of different races,
        treating eachother as billions of different states. Making pacts
        &amp; treaties between each other without third sides of
        disgusting oppressors, only third and fourth sides of friendly
        neighbours, because it’s better to be lovely than hated. Whey
        you’re lovely, people support you, help you, protect you, love
        you. When you’re hated, you are in a higher risk of being
        slaughtered – if not by those you destroyed, then by someone
        else – even if by extraterrestrials, who would scan what’s going
        on here, and if the living form dominating this planet is lovely
        – they embrace it; if it’s ugly dangerous – they may even
        destroy it. Be lovely, baby. If you’re not, wait till we invent
        some loveliness enhancer. We’ll do our best just to invent it
        soon.<br>

      <p>Or could it be that numerals originate from the names of gods?
        For gods could originally be abstract notions not equally
        comprehended among population thus could be anthropomorphied by
        some of them<br>

      <p>But let’s return to our runic calendars:<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <img src="img/177.png" alt="" height="519" align="right"
          width="354"></div>
      <p>And though none of these runic calendars seems to follow the
        alphabetic sequence we researched earlier, even though seeing ᚦ
        after ᛒ makes me think they misinterpreted them, and what they
        see as E is actually F, and what they see as F is actually G (a
        form of ᚦ bound with ᛣ, just as G is a form of C+J,</p>
      <p>I hope authors of these images will excuse me using them to
        arrange them according to my narrative, for readers should&nbsp;
        be able to use reverse search (which was invented by tineye and
        now google and yandex&nbsp; both usually can find the sources if
        you feed these images to them. For even if I told you sites
        where I found all these, who knows if those sites are original
        places of origin of these images. Even though I sometimes do
        give you links, there’s no guarantee they’re original ones,
        especially wiki which is all copypaste.<br>
        <br>
      </p>

          width="1000"><br>

      <p>But if c stands for staveless d, this I can only guess) and
        what they see as g is actually h. But I have no degree in
        runology, so let’s say it’s just a bold guess. But of course it
        makes me wonder why the rune which stood for H here stands for
        A, and what supposedly stands for h in the alphabetic runestone
        from Bornholm stands for the next letter. If it’s connected with
        how greeks made H sound like E or И, or is it just because they
        took the ᛡ rune to use it for A, this all I can only guess, but
        of course from such boldest guests new valid theories arise. But
        this link tells that it’s okay and ᛡ can be a form of ᛆ: <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C4%93ran" style="">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jēran</a>
        yet there’s also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haglaz">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haglaz</a>&nbsp;<font
          color="#C0C0C0">- few words on greek H – in words like “hello”
          we have the first syllable sounding almost like semitic hey (ה
          or ه) though of course that’s because of e, when english h is
          almost silent, unlike in other languages, if some french
          occupiers pronounced ll as short i, it could be etymology of
          hi, and further in netherlands, to oi – or was it the other
          way around? complicating?</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>And though none of these runic calendars seems to follow the
        alphabetic sequence we researched earlier, I also found a couple
        of calendars, using latin letters instead of runes:<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/179.png" alt="" height="791"

          width="540"><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <p>And I will also leave this obscure Lithuanian image in case
        somebody will find it useful, maybe I will return to it, for now
        I can only give the machine translation for its 4 pav. Lenteles
        Menulio fazems ir savaites dienoms nustatyti: 1 – raktas Menulio
        fazems nustatyti; 2 – raktas savaites dienoms nustatyti; 3 –
        pakorequotas raktas, which stands for Figure 4 Tables for menus
        phases and weekdays for setting days: 1 — key for menus phases
        setting; 2 is the key for setting weekdays; 3 — the key is the
        reverse key<br>
      </p>
      <p>Suddenly I got interested, and I visited the site: <a
href="http://www.radikaliai.lt/radikaliai/3610-ar-lietuviai-turejo-runas">http://www.radikaliai.lt/radikaliai/3610-ar-lietuviai-turejo-runas</a>
        and I found there this calendar as well:<br>
      </p>
      <div align="left"><img src="img/182.png" alt="" height="361"
          align="right" width="540">
        <p>and though I could translate the lithuanian text there, it
          didn’t make it more clear on what it is all about. There are
          some books’ names, if somebody read it and can clarify this
          issue, please send me a note. Thank you.<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>But here what I’ve found about those 19 runes: Даты полнолуния
        отмечались 19 числовыми значениями рун (которые определялись
        алфавитным порядком), называемыми «золотые числа». The
        translation is: Full moon dates were marked with 19 numerical
        values of runes (which were determined by alphabetical order),
        called "golden numbers". — which makes me think “rune = lune?”
        but here I just make it all drafty, I haven’t even seen this
        scheme, nor did I hear of 19 runes before I put it here. On the
        one hand I let you see how I think, on the other hand it’s
        completely unprofessional.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>If you wonder why I give such attention to the script which
        allegedly appeared later in history, I must say that I seriously
        doubt it is true. First of all, in the 20th century it was
        widely taught that runes appeared somewhere between 4th and 8th
        centuries AD, when I noticed that Tacitus in Germania describes
        something that could be runic divination, even though translator
        used twice as much text to conceal this detail, I began finding
        works where the origin of runes was placed at the beginning of
        AD, and though I don’t think I somehow switched the timeline, I
        am still suspicious of modern runology, occup<br>
      </p>
      <p>But let’s return to the previous image edited according to what
        I said.<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/183.png" alt="" height="282"
          width="360"></div>
      <p>I haven’t seen what they understood as e among all the google
        images on runes, and I only saw the R with additional leg only
        among bindrunes (shown above).<br>
      </p>
      <p>And now I wonder what made a &amp; h interchange. And is that h
        rune actually the æ rune? Because if you&nbsp; see at the
        artefact, its diagonal doesn’t actually go straight, but is
        broken in the middle. haven’t found&nbsp; such rune either. But
        if it’s actually vowel, isn’t this alphabetic order even older
        than the Bornholm&nbsp; alphabet stone with which I put before?<br>

      <p>upd: all of the sudden, I found that I probably figured that
        weird form for runic g correctly, because look at this image,
        the third weird sign on the right panel stands for g:<br>

            Bureus</a> was a religious Christian, but he also thought

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet">Latin
            alphabet</a>. His good reputation and his influential
          friends enabled him to acquire the royal privilege that no
          alphabet books could be printed without teaching the runic
          alphabet and no one was allowed to print them but himself. The
          result was that the first Swedish alphabet book ever printed
          had the purpose of teaching runes.[<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runa_ABC#cite_note-1">1</a>]<br>

      <font size="+1"> </font>
      <p><font size="+1">The first edition of Runa ABC was printed in
          1611. It contained the Latin alphabet in ABC order and the
          runic alphabet in both the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futhark">futhark</a>
          order and in the order of the Latin alphabet. Bureus had also
          added the names of the runes, the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemes">phonemes</a>
          they represented as well as some spelling rules. The booklet
          contained small Christian texts, which were written in runes
          on one side and in Latin letters on the opposite one. The last
          edition was printed in 1624, and it was more pedagogical than
          the first one, since the Latin letters were placed directly
          under the runes. Whereas the first edition ended with some
          prayers written in Latin letters, the 1624 edition had the
          final prayers written with runes, without any Latin
          transliteration.[<a

      <p>But what grasped my attention is the “Bureus was a religious
        Christian… His good reputation and his influential friends
        enabled him to acquire the royal privilege that no alphabet
        books could be printed without teaching the runic alphabet and
        no one was allowed to print them but himself.” If it was not
        attempt to shut the opposing views on the subject, then what was
        it? Could it be that the field felt revival and they only
        allowed to a devout christian to publish anything on the
        subject. At least until his point of view has taken roots as the
        established one. And you know how it is in humanities. They came
        out of monasteries and it shows. Heretics will burn, duh.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Or could this baby christian be an honest fellow who had some
        noble reasons to acquire that outrageous priviledge? I honestly
        doubt it, but it didn’t miss my attention that his ættir have 5
        runes each (as if those dice had an empty side each).
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Though Bureus is considered to be a father of “scientific”
        runology, runes were in use before him, of course. Here’s a scan
        from Edred Thorsson’s Runelore:<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/189.png" alt="" height="172"
          width="540"><br>

      <p>“Expanded”, which gives opportunity to compare this set of 25
        with the 18 of alphabet of Bornholm stone, to see which runes
        they added.&nbsp; (the t presented here is just an invariant of
        the t presented there)<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="img/190.png" height="305"
          width="270"><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <p>I also previously spoke of my hypothesis that runes could be
        used on dice, and though “no archeological evidence of runic
        dice exists” here’s a die given by Bureus in one of his books
        and named “falling stone” – many theories exist about
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what this stone is, but of course falling is
        what dies do. I wonder if the image of the other three sides
        exist, but probably not, because these 15 runes are exactly the
        15 runes he uses in groups in exactly these 3 sides of his RVNA
        ABC.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But hey! isn’t it three dice with one empty slot each, shown in
        whole! and those dice are literally a b c<font color="#CCCCCC"><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">The funny detail of this discovery is
          that I found it (I just found it) listening to <span style="">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXKgP6mkwuQ</span>
          (THERION — The Falling Stone (Live 2007)) even though they
          don’t seem to know what I just found, muses work in mysterious
          ways. I never listened to them, because I didn’t know of them
          when I was into Manowar, and now even Slayer is not heavy
          enough for my taste. But they’re alright. Witches rock!</font><br>

      </div>
      <br>
      <p>But if there used to be only 15 runes, how could they count
        with them?<br>
        Because it’s peculiar that they’re divided in 3 groups, just as
        letters before them in this text were divided into ones, tens
        &amp; hundreds. And seeing the image on the right makes me
        think. Especially when I vaguely remember the joke by Mel Brooks
        that there used to be three “tablets of stone”. Is this
        remembrance even based? Could that jewish joke was based on
        nothing, just a mild blasphemy? I don’t think so, and search for
        “third tablet of stone” returns “third tablet of stone that
        Moses dropped on his way down” on a not very reliable sourch,
        but nevertheless, let it be just a guess, and it there’s a
        reference to this in oral torah or not, I will find out later.
        But three tablets by 5 allow you to calculate, because 5+4 equal
        that very same 9. And to calculate in hebrew alphabet they don’t
        always use sophits, but combine smaller letters instead to get
        numbers from 500 to 900. Now seeing how much letter hey reminds
        letter thav I wonder if it is mirrored to aleph with key of
        gimel in the middle and beth reflecting dalet or am I trippin
        againg?<br>
      </p>
      <p>But seriously, wild sumptions based mostly on researcher’s
        intuitions? Yet the runic dice thing was also based on the same
        thin air, but happened to be the key to understanding of what
        the “falling stone” falls for. So these guesses will whether
        confirm with something or they will fall off. There’re many
        false assumptions in linguistic literature, one more one less,
        at least I tell not to take it all on faith.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Now let’s compare runic sequences from those calendars:<br>
      </p>
      <img src="img/193.png" alt="" height="180" align="left"
        width="270">
      <p>Though that piece of Lithuanian calendar rather follows futhark
        order, but somehow why do 3 out of these 7 letters coinside? And
        the fourth one like almost coincide, it’s like 3.5 out of 7,
        it’s very fuсking suspicious. I’m being unprofessionally drafty
        again, but stay with me. What if futhark is just a
        reinterpretation of alphabetic runic order? I really think I saw
        A like that F somewhere. Like ᚨ is considered to stand for A, ᚩ
        stands for O, and ᚪ aslo stands for A (probably for something
        between O &amp; A) and oh, there’s a difference ᚨ stands for A
        &amp; ᚫ stands for Æ and there’s also ᚬ representing /ɑ̃/ and
        sometimes /o/ or /oː/. Younger futhark, elder futhorc, it’s all
        the same theoretical crap to me, I am independent here, for a
        reason. I am not sure if I should trust these interpretations of
        runes I find online, but I believe that when I collect enough of
        these data in my head, it will crystalize into structure that’s
        actually there. So let’s go on. The V rune is not articulatorily
        far from the B that’s supposed to stand there, and dialect
        differences can explain it, but R even though it’s that 0.5
        coincidence, dude like what, but then “what if it’s the
        primordial alphabet, because it looks like the final row of the
        Bornholm alphabet, like what if ᛅ actually stands for T? Because
        the letter before R does look like O, standing before R in the
        final row of Bornholm alphabet &amp; after it stands ᛣ which
        sometimes told to be stand for some other form of R, but other
        times it’s said to represent Y and what I see between R &amp;
        ᛅ.. excuse me, between ᚱ &amp; ᛅ but this hypothesis is so new
        to me, you shouldn’t even be seeing this, you probably shouldn’t
        even be here, begone.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But I will go on: they write that later ᚨ became ᚬ which is a
        form of ᚮ (on the Bornholm alphabet stone (from now on I’m
        simply gonna name it BAS) the diagonal stroke go upwards, so I
        think it doesn’t matter which way they go, it’s just a stick
        with two strokes on it. Don’t I contradict myself? I definitely
        do, but I will figure it out better later. Let’s move on, if it
        doesn’t matter if diagonal goes up or down (or if it’s even
        straight, as the foreright rune on the previous image shows,
        it’s probably the same ᚮ adjusting to the neighbouring ᚦ (I
        couldn’t even find a unicode for the upwards ᚮ like wtf)<br>
      </p>
      <p>ⵣ looks like it’s a bindrune, but it’s actually ⵣ, appelé yaz,
        est une lettre de l’alphabet amazigh, le tifinagh . Elle
        représente une consonne fricative alvéolaire voisée /z/. Yaz est
        aussi le symbole de la langue et de la culture berbère en
        Afrique du Nord, représentant l’homme libre dans la culture
        berbère. And this sign is sacred among both berbers &amp; some
        celts, I don’t remember if irish or scottish or even icelandic,
        the beautiful snowflake of the holy day. But first, Alphabet
        Amazigh, le Tifinagh:<br>

          эти истории говорят о том, что письменность нсибиди является
          настолько древней, что даже местная традиция не сохранила
          никаких сведений относительно её подлинного происхождения.</font>
        &amp; <font size="+1">The symbols are at least several
          centuries old—early forms appeared on excavated pottery as
          well as what are most likely ceramic stools and headrests from
          the Calabar region, with a range of dates from 400 to 1400 CE.</font>
        And the africans who spoke about them first and thus are
        supposed authors of these scripts claimed that they only used
        previously known signs, and arranged them alphabetically, the
        same thing cherokee indians said, but archaeology doesn’t
        approve of that, though if those signs are secret (like runes
        were, that’s why it’s hard to find much evidence from before
        2000 years ago) even though Northern myths tell of invention of
        runes, when Greek historians tell of borrowing them from some
        other nation. And as slavic languages call golden flees RUNO, I
        dare to claim that no other reason was to take all those
        adventures to get the “golden fleas” if it was just a goldened
        sheep skin. But as we know that sheep skin was used as
        pergament, we can compare the argonauts’ myth (the homonym argot
        is also directly linguistic term today) to holy tree from the
        northern myth<img src="img/209.png" alt="" height="283"
          align="right" width="540"> about runes, we find a reptile
        around those trees in both mythos. So though I contradict
        linguistic dogma of primate of Greek alphabet to the Runic one,
        I still stand this ground <font color="#CCCCCC">(I will return
          to this contraversial topic later, even though this part of
          this tractate is probably in the other 50% which I whether
          read somewhere or invented myself, this one I invented
          myself).</font><br>

      <p>And I just found where did argonauts take that RUNO of theirs:
        Colchis, the nation of Sakartvello, the georgians who have one
        of the most harmonic alphabets, and in some account it is THE
        MOST harmonic. And suddenly I notice that the eastern Iberia I
        mentioned before is neighbouring the Colchis or also a georgian
        nation itself.<br>

      and suddenly I found someone else speaking of the same, probably
      he had more sources than I do:<br>

        let's move forther to the North,where Сelts live:</p>
      <p>The most keltic writing system I know about is Ogham. And
        though I still cannot tell much about this system, The
        Ballaqueenee Stone I in the Manx Museum, Isle of Man.<br>

      <p>The scheme below shows that ogham can be separated in groups of
        5, which resembles 5 runes per a falling stone. And the scheme
        above tells that these groups are named aicme. As you can see on
        this rock and many others, usually only first four aicmes are
        used. And then text can be read differently in the opposite
        direction, but probably direction was fixed.<br>

      <br>
      <p>What is important to notice in the context of this work is that
        ogham also contains the same 5 vowels and that consonant aicmes
        mostly begin with labials: only f &amp; h are mishmashed, but
        it’s okay, because in japanese they’re literally the same
        “letter” and their h has b &amp; p as invariants. And if
        official science doesn’t allow to line such far parralels, I
        don’t care about their views, because I counted them to be false
        too many times to take them too seriously. it’s divide et empera
        all they teach. as if god himself devided us and so we must stay
        separated for their advantage of course. But times change and I
        wish they will change their moldy ways. Let them read it and get
        enlightened. Let me show you how little I care of their

      </p>
      <p>And we move on. The most celtic writing systems among the
        modern ones is Gaelic Script:<br>

      <p>Of course I took freedom here, claiming u had to be v when this
        alphabet appeared.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But this claim is rather scientific, because it can be whether
        proven or disproved.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Especially in the context of… oh, no, Bornholm alphabet also
        takes final U as V.</p>
      <p>So it’s sort of proven… at least supported by the previous
        research. And the only structural difference between irelandic
        alphabet &amp; bornholm runes is that c is put after b, not
        after i as in bornholm; and a letter before R appeared, and a
        letter after R disappeared, but this alphabet also has 18
        letters. But I’m still in doubt. Even though in words like bua
        it does sound like consonant [w], but in words like agus it does
        sound like vowel [u] – maybe it used to be w there too.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So I didn’t see ⵣ in any celtic ornaments, so I probably was
        mistaken by comparing ⵣ with ᛡ I've known of in the same period
        of time.<br>

      But while I was looking, I met another interesting sign of human
      culture, the swastika. The one on the left is intricate because
      though it rotates solar, it goes on it’s ends counter solar. It’s
      only drawn this way, but when it rotates solar, it rotates centers
      of its tails solar, so it can grow, evolve. Just like these little
      babies do: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIazVcdEkr8"

      react to sun. Though now I’m not sure I couldn’t prove the

      <p>Some people say nazi swastika is unlucky one, countersolar,
        downwards: when water goes down in the northern hemisphere it’s
        believed to go counter-clockwise, and then the воронка makes
        this way looking waves. I should make some research to see if
        it’s true. Luckily for me I have internet, so I shouldn’t go
        look for it in the oceans myself: <a

        element systems. But sefer yetzirah tells that it’s fire, water
        &amp; air. But it’s whether because they were off their soil, or
        by mistake because what vowel can be if not air, or simply to
        conceal the true trinity, because sefer yetzirah tells that it’s
        a huge secret. Air, שָׁמַיִם as it is given <font
          color="#CCCCCC">(but translated as Heaven)</font> in the first
        chapter of bible, about which sefer yetzirah theorizes, is the
        combination of water מים and fire אש, the steam <font
          color="#CCCCCC">אֵד</font> – at least we can see steam – think
        this way and you can see how they thought – fire, water &amp;
        soil are three states of matter: gasous, liquid &amp; solid. So
        air is only water’s fire, but there’re many more: with poisonous
        gas you cannot breathe.<br>

      <p>Great french poet Arthur Rimbaud colours pure vowel A in soil
        black. And he colours lingual I in flamboyant red, and labial O
        is water blue. O, not U, weird, but then again O-row is more
        primal than U-row but he also replaces U &amp; O yet he
        juxtaposes O with Omega, not Omicron, which tells that he didn't
        know of alphabetic structure. But he colours Omega purple, not
        blue, so he could have some idea. Yet I'm not sure he coloured
        the text below himself, but neigher did I, it's a direct
        copy-paste from the first search result:<br>

            standing for vowels also makes sense in case those repeating

            the same theme on different lands. It interestingly
            corresponds that many main continents are named with vowels:

            Most of them begin with A. A opens the first row. Second row

          there are so many bs in official linguistics. So A could stand

      <p>Gankyil is named wheel of joy – and comparing this concept to
        swastikas, I'd expect these fish to go clock-wise, but they go
        counter-clockwise. Is it how jewish letters i<img

        are supposed to roll the disk clockwise, so fish goes heads
        front? But it doesn't make sense in this context, because "fish"
        will rotate with the disk. So once again, you shouldn't practice
        this practices until you research it properly, before you read
        about it from someone who really know and you can not trust but
        understand, I will do my best to find this information (then
        I'll edit this part. but for now I am not competent in magic
        even of this secualar form.<br>
        Here's a collection of similar forms, and Gankyil is fourth:<br>

      <p>Maybe the question of which way to roll is meaningless, since
        steering it one way means going rounds, and to move forward we
        have to steer both left &amp; right. Or maybe those lefts and
        rights correspond black and white stripes, and maybe it's not
        that meaningless if rotation to one direction is more healthy
        than the other (because of the blood flow and of the
        excentricity of our heart)<br>

        counter clock-wise being unlucky could be completely wrong <font
          color="#CCCCCC">even though words clock &amp; luck are alike,</font>
        so they could only know left and right, and on that taiko drum
        the other side is probably hidari (not migi) mitsudomoe<font
          color="#C0C0C0">, just as american flag looks the other side
          on a right shoulder only to look the same way, forward. After
          or before mitsu(3) t"omoe of three elements inevitably
          appeared four elements of ࿌ which could splat linguals further
          into velar &amp; coronal.</font> <font color="#CCCCCC">And
          this symbol could give birth to ࿖ which being projected to
          dualities gave ࿕ – which, as you can see walks to the left

          looks the othe way, so it’s twice wrong form. use ࿖ instead.
          First I thought it was arbitrary, taking roots only in
          tradition, and thus being purely psychological or none. Today
          I remember of chirality of biological molecules, and suspect
          some physiological moments involved.</font><br>

          assumptions, juxtaposing types of letters with magatamas, but
          they're determined by tai-chi look at futatsudomoe as opposite
          elements and sefer yetzirah juxtaposing 3 basic letters with
          elements. Now I have to look for graphic or some other
          correspondances to tie these concepts more firmly: I would
          expect to see labial water as futatsudomoe, but it's mitsu (3)
          sounding as water. Can it be connected with the fact, that
          they have velar after vowels (I whether spoke about it before
          or will speak further on. I edit this text wildly back and
          forth/) <font color="#999999">and armenians even know such

            supports what I just said. About swasti signs facing the
            opposite way of where they’re going (letter walks forward,
            but looks back) – could it explain why b faces where it
            goes, not where it came from ? But in aegyptian it faced
            where it came from, could swastika influence it? And could
            it happen not further, than the last two millenia? Because

      <p>Another famous cabbalistic symbol – tree of sefirot – probably
        was built for wrong alphabet: when it builds 18 letter alphabet
        (the alphabet of 3 dice) it gives tetraktis, with 3 angles as 3
        roots of the tree of life in normanic tradition:<br>
      </p>
      <p>the tetraktis on the left is called plebean <font

      <p>Are sphirot (cyphers, цифры) spheres? A буквы кубы? (Are books

        also to easily separate archives if needed – I did the same with
        my vault, so it’s probably natural)<br>
      </p>
      <p>I filled in the runes in tetraktis the way that latin tetraktis
        was filled, but they could be wrong about the direction of the
        filling. If I used boustrophedon, I would have 3 angles

      <p>I know that I act as if I want to bring neurosis, which would
        help you to believe in magic, but I hve to remind you to be
        careful with runes and 231 gates. These are the only two
        pre-cautions I read about magic. But common knowledge seems to
        tell that all magic is dangerous, and you should be ver cautious
        doing it.<br>

      <p>For five years now this work is in public discussion since,
        after a couple of decades now of digging into it, I began making
        it public in <span style="text-decoration:overline">I</span><span
          style="text-decoration:overline">I</span>XIII <font
          color="#CCCCCC">– is it what gave birth to letters T &amp; П?
          — П is greek form of P, which could stand for&nbsp; II&nbsp; -
          but in script this overstroke is easily seen (as i? Maybe) So
          before П and III there was just&nbsp; I&nbsp; repeated until V
          and X – but what letters are these? O &amp; R? or D &amp; A? D
          already was present in the first do(or die). to riot (or
          leave). to right (or left). and so on. So, could this T thing
          explain why russian t is m in cursive, could it be that when
          serif became fashion, it wasn’t easy to read the overline, so
          they used arc instead of stroke sometimes, but it was read as
          T(housand) &amp; T(ысяча) and somewhere else – M(ille) – the
          same sign, different meanings.</font><br>

      <p>For at least three years now this koptic scheme was taken wrong
        (I didn’t see it was well in axial, and not because I saw H as
        vowel (I din’t know) but instead of simply silly miscalculating.
        And nobody told me. Probably those who could see it were too
        overwhelmed to contact, or just took H for vowel and wondered
        why would I exclude it from vowels (and I did because I was
        looking for the initial form, in which H is consonant, and I'm
        not sure about Θ: it's lingual in semitic alphabets (hebrew,
        arabic &amp; <font color="#999999">even persian though it's not
          a semitic language, it uses almost the same alphabet arabic
          does),</font> but it's labial in hellenic ones (greek,
        russian, koptic — though it's often taught that it's lingual in
        greek and koptic too, though in those countries it still sounds
        like labial; in russian everybody knows it's labial. We,
        russians, we say Ѳ = Ф, we really don't see a difference and we
        don't care)<br>
        <font color="#cccccc">(Ѳ &amp; Θ are historically the very same
          letter, ѳ = </font><font color="#cccccc"><font
            color="#cccccc">θ</font>) </font></p>
      <p>I take H &amp; Θ as greeks have them, <font color="#FF0000">H</font><font
          color="#3366FF">Θ</font> – it definitely relates to making e
        consonant in arabic. And in jewish too, but jews didn’t live in
        Israel for quite a long time, though their hey is sometimes
        vowel, which makes arabs alone in their reform: all the other
        countries have hey vowel. And it’s the most consonant vowel in
        arabic, it’s followed by vuv being both w &amp; u, giving birth
        to the fifth vowel: runic alphabet does have it, but in the end,
        replaced by F, showing the consonant form of v (as in german
        von) – fita was also replaced to the end of the alphabet, even
        though it had numeral position of 9 – though in glagolica 9th is
        the similar letter, which sounds as z, and it could be
        post-reformed, when it hit in greece. If I’m lucky, I can even
        find it in nikonian times, but it’s probably from some more
        ancient past (but if I find it in nikonian, I will have a coin
        into “shorter history” theory.<br>

      <p>This chart ranks fita 500, which support theory of glagolica
        appearance being later than kirillic script appeared. Also
        notice how letters 9 &amp; 500 look alike on this image, 500
        simply has two balls (not just lune, but lun &amp; sun, moon is
        l’loon?)<br>

      <p>Wow, here’s another one, adding some interesting perspective,
        and with θ:&nbsp; <img src="img/262.png" alt="" height="1372"
          align="right" width="540"><br>
      </p>
      <div align="center">
        <p>According to this table, kirillic greek had only one labial
          in the first line, and double form was borrowed from glagolic
          (the old one, prechristian as I figured it out for somewhat
          like 80%)<br>
        </p>
        <p>Here I must give my reasoning for this rather bold claim:<br>
          I caught christians in plagiary of armenian, georgian, permian
          alphabets. So I even think of researching the Canadian
          Aboriginal syllabics<br>

      <img src="img/canadian.png" alt="" height="493" width="440"><br>
      <p>It's so beautiful and the "inspiration Ewans claim to cause
        this invention was so unrelated to this beauty, that<br>
      </p>
      <p>I dare to claim, it's exactly Aboriginal writing system.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>But I will return to americans later, now I speak more of why
        Glagolic is pre-christian writing system:<br>
      </p>
      <p>2) it's graphically unique<br>
      </p>
      <p>3) it contains symmetry christians didn't know about: Б &amp; Д
        can be seen as symmetric: one has stick above ball, the other
        has ball above stick.<br>
      </p>
      <p>b &amp; d are more obviously symmetric, and so are Ⰲ &amp; Ⰴ<br>
      </p>
      <p>4) Ⰳ as angle, which is paneuropean, but why would christian do
        it so alike to runic ᚲ<br>
      </p>
      <p>But a counter-argument is that greek cursive δ looks like
        glagolic Ⰴ sometimes, and that somebody wrote so. But inventing
        glagolica would be making things more complicated for those who
        work in the region. Why wouldn't you use your greek after it
        worked so good even in Egypt, so they did exactly that, as in
        egypt: greek uncial with some national additional letters. Or am
        I only triiippinn<br>

      <p>For some long time I didn’t understand that russian alphabet
        also can be represented in axial symmetry. Now I see, that e
        &amp; ё are one letter, just as и &amp; й are more alike than i
        &amp; j. Even though what j has is named swash, and usually
        isn’t more meaningful than serif. decoratif.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The same way french &amp; german alphabets have the same latin
        alphabet england uses, even though they have some strange
        invariants of several letters (usually vowels, just as in
        russian. but also modified c in french ç &amp; modified s in
        german ß)<br>
      </p>
      <p>Notice, that russian ИЙ are like Y (literally и-грек) either
        vowel or consonant. The consonant variant is marked with brevis.
        Y is also often written in netherlands as ij.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Honestly, I doubt christians ever knew about these structures,
        considering the way they botchered armenian alphabet &amp; made
        all those weird reforms (just compare russian matrices to
        latin&nbsp; and hebrew, though arabic also falls from grace when
        it pronounce its e as a consonant.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I noticed before, that russian lineal goes like a fir, and now
        I see some fir or pine. Do these form relate to some trees?
        Ogham letters did refer to some trees. Latin axial alphabet is
        definitely a fir:<br>
      </p>
      <p>But let’s return to calendars: we have 12 month, but 13 moons
        per a jear <font color="#C0C0C0">(жар, шар)</font> what if we
        had 6 days per week? <font color="#C0C0C0">(just as there’re
          only 6 notes on Gvido’s tombstone)</font> then how many weeks
        per year would it be? With seven days per week we have 52 weeks
        per a year. With six days per week we have.. and 366 asks to be
        devided into 6, not 7, 62. then not 13 weeks per a season, but
        31 weeks per half a year. hm…<br>
      </p>
      <p>And those 13 moons became 13 weeks; 31 weeks became 31 days<br>
        Probably because 366 contains… not 62, but 61 – I sucked at math
        again, but such coincidence it caused, that it’s hard for me not
        to believe in demons.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But hey! 61 is 30 plus 31 – exactly how we have those month
        length.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So that’s where it came from, and a week of 6 days confirmed. ᚼ
        is probably the divider, the way it looks, the blessing, the
        wide spread (at least from ireland to berbers) blessing sign.
        But of course, I found that 6: hidden in our 12 of the months. <font
          color="#33FF33">What was I talking here about? how can</font>
        <font color="#33FF33">ᚼ be just a divider, there're solstices
          arranged, there're some certain number of signs. How many of
          such not raw, but also rotten places in this text!? How many
          years will it take me to edit it&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p>Let’s see some more calendars, after you ponder about it:</p>
      <p>While I was looking for runeless calendars to see if they
        divide days in sixs, but no, they use 7, though they’re late. I
        revisited that baltic calendar instead:<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/263.png" alt="" height="819"
          align="left" width="450"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>So let’s return to it and see what it said:<br>
      </p>
      <p>Full moon dates were marked with 19 numerical values of runes
        (which were determined by alphabetical order), called "golden
        numbers".<br>
      </p>
      <p>So once again, rune = lune?<br>
      </p>
      <p>And why 8 &amp; 10 look so alike?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Check letters 8 &amp; 10 in “kirillic” script – I dislike this
        name, but it’s the most recognized name of it, so I recall
        Stigler’s law of eponimy and let it be.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So I once again suspect, what if futhark is actually alphabet?
        I saw A’s as F’s in runic theories: here it’s under number 4,
        but it’s just another vowel, the e (compare arabic vowels to
        european: 1st looks like 3rd, 2nd looks like 4th, 3rd looks like
        5th, 4th looks like 2nd. And they don’t have the 5th, though
        their vav looks a little like the 1st european vowel a in
        reverse – so as musical modes are different, so could the vowels
        be mishmashed according to nation’s musical taste and voice.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But what 19 has to do with 28? so I wonder if this theory I
        quote is even correct, could be a wild assumptio, due to
        misunderstanding of this signs being a writing system. Or at
        least a cipher. Though 19 is 12+7 and 12th rune is the often
        final ᛏ<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/264.png" alt="" height="240"
          width="810"></div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>I calculated 90 days in the lowest season, which makes my
        assumption about ᚼ being not a letter, happened to be false.
        Does it make this work contradict itself? Sure it does, it's so
        great (groß) that it definitely is full of all types of
        inconsistencies whether because I had time to change my mind on
        some question, for it was written for so long that I had time to
        change, or it's just гонево <font color="#cccccc">Here used to
          be some other paragraph, but it was embarrassingly wrong or
          false, so I wonder how many of such garbage do I have to clean
          out of here, because this book was written fast, but I was
          high on weed most of the time writing it, and when weed is
          stronger or you smoked too much, it can make you silly too.</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>E could become consonant in arabic, and H too become vowel in
        greek to justify the change of θ‘s position? Hardly otherwise is
        true, but it could also be that those languages saved the
        archaic forms of those letters, when we made E vowel and H
        consonant to make people forget that θ is labial, thus the in
        theology is female. But if it’s true that all the other greek
        dialects had H consonant, then this case is unlikely. Though we
        have to revisit every theoretic work with ai capabilities.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But back to weeks, I was looking for 6 days week, but I only
        found some african example:<br>
      </p>
      <p>Calendars unrelated to the Chaldean, Hellenistic, Christian or
        Jewish traditions often have time cycles between the day and the
        month of varying lengths, sometimes also called "weeks".<br>
      </p>
      <p>An eight-day week was used in Ancient Rome and possibly in the
        pre-Christian Celtic calendar. Traces of a nine-day week are
        found in Baltic languages and in Welsh. The ancient Chinese
        calendar had a ten-day week, as did the ancient Egyptian
        calendar (and, incidentally, the French Republican Calendar,
        dividing its 30-day months into thirds).<br>
      </p>
      <p>A six-day week is found in the Akan Calendar. Several cultures
        used a five-day week, including the 10th century Icelandic
        calendar, the Javanese calendar, and the traditional cycle of
        market days in Korea.[citation needed] The Igbo have a "market
        week" of four days. Evidence of a "three-day week" has been
        derived from the names of the days of the week in Guipuscoan
        Basque.[47]<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Aztecs and Mayas used the Mesoamerican calendars. The most
        important of these calendars divided a ritual cycle of 260 days
        (known as Tonalpohualli in Nahuatl and Tzolk'in in Yucatec Maya)
        into 20 weeks of 13 days (known in Spanish as trecenas). They
        also divided the solar year into 18 periods of 20 days and five
        nameless days, creating a 20-day month divided into four
        five-day weeks. The end of each five-day week was a market
        day.[48][49]<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Balinese Pawukon is a 210-day calendar consisting of 10
        different simultaneously running weeks of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
        8, 9 and 10 days, of which the weeks of 4, 8 and 9 days are
        interrupted to fit into the 210-day cycle.<br>
        Here’s the roman calendar of 8 days per week (I wonder if it
        relates to modern musical notation and with that H note,
        russians but not americans know)<br>

      <p>See why I think it matters? Because there’s tradition of
        marking days of week by alphabetic order. But here, is it
        alphabetic order or futhark is actually futhark and runology
        wasn’t wrong all the time? Prudence tells me it was not, but
        historic evidence about Scheele tells me that old theories can
        be wrong.<br>

      <p>This calednar topic is so vast, I need to become a specialist
        in it, before I dare to tell anything about it, but I search
        well, I have internets on my side, it makes me more powerful

      <p>"Ancient Baltic cosmological schemes have been found on burial
        urns dated from 600-200 BC. As with other Bronze Age cultures,
        there were megaliths associated with the summer and winter
        solstices; hill enclaves with solar calendars have been
        discovered at Birutė Mountain near Palanga,[1] and at the
        Purmaliai mound near Klaipėda. A modern interpretation of the
        ancient solar calendar was created in 2002 at the Kretinga
        Museum. Lithuanian calendar shows some similarities with Slavic
        calendar, and so may have roots in Proto-Balto-Slavic era."<br>

        of a lunar calendar, and on this image lunar calendar is
        combined with the solar one. The weird thing is I had 28 days
        per moon in my mind. Was it because of 4 weeks per 7 day each?
        Could arabic alphabet of 28 be related to lunar calendar? Arabs
        do use lunar calendar. Let’s search for arabic calendars..(I
        havent’ found much, but anyway, here’s where I’m going to
        research them from now on: hiperlink(<a href="astrolabes.html">astrolabes</a>))<br>
      </p>
      <p>My draft tells me to go deeper into house of music, because I
        have discovered some detail of why could humans shift musical
        notation like two steps higher than alphabetic order goes:
        ABCDEFG is natural minor, Aeolian mode. CDEFGAB is its <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_key">relative
          major</a>.<font color="#666666"> <font color="#999999">and it
            is named Ionian mode.</font> </font><font color="#cccccc">And




































          Ionian is the dialect of greeks which became modern greek of
          the xX aD.</font> The reasons beyond this switch from minor to
        major is still unknown to me, but I know that major scale is
        named Ionian mode, exactly like that dialect, on which modern
        Greek alphabet is founded, so these two facts could be related.
        They also say, that even though modern musical modes took their
        names after ancient greek modes, they’re different, so I
        wouldn’t me surprised if originally aeolian mode was pentatonic,
        and those two letters added by Apollo priests were related to
        the two additional notes. And there’s such a thing as aeolian
        pentatonic scale, but I’m too dilettante in musical theory to
        keep on talking about it. It’s definitely an interesting topic,
        and I will return to it some day. But some more should be told
        about it, before we go further: when christian englishmen
        occupied Iceland, they prohibited icelanders to sing for a
        couple of centuries. Probably, because music and magic are
        similar topics, muslims directly prohibit music (I suppose this
        outrageous prohibition comes out of jewish law – it’s hilarious
        how both muslims and christians disgust jews, yet follow jewish
        teachings. Blindly they follow, what a practical joke! Anyway,
        musical notation is even more obscure theme, than magic. Though
        I’m sure human culture somehow preserved answers to all the
        questions we have.<br>
        <br>

      <p>Musical modes do have deep connection to accent people speak
        of:&nbsp; if you compare russian and english vowels, Russians
        see A as completely open mouth. It can be relaxed, but it’s
        open. And in english it’s Э, Æ – suddenly I think “is it because
        they smile more?” Their E is И (I) and their O is closer to
        russian U (but u stands in russian cursive for и, which sounds
        like i in inn, hm..) But then they pronounce I.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Karl Fossler even identified accents of nations with their
        languages’ souls. And righteously did he, because before he did,
        that monastery bs about soul of the language didn’t have much of
        semantic features, being as euphemerous as understanding of a
        human soul (if we have it when we’re born, than it’s not our
        memories or personal traits we develop in the lifetime, so what
        is it? In early jewish books it’s synonymous to life, but in
        Ruth or around it soul acquires some supernatural forces such as
        immortality.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And if you hear somebody speaking a foreign language with a
        grave accent, you can notice that what makes most of the
        difference is that (s)he uses vowels from a native language.
        Speech defects, on the other hand, are usually in the consonant
        realm, even though foreigners may be foreign to some peculiar
        sounds like th or w, but they usually figure it out eventually,
        but vowels are not even taught enough.<br>
      </p>
      <p>On the image of monochord by Robert Fludd you can see that
        notes are marked the other way around, and the scale used to be
        descending, not ascending modern europeans are used to. And
        Fludd lived in 17th century, so this reform couldn’t be too far
        in the past. I’m even sure that some nations still keep their
        national musical traditions, which contains keys to decipher
        this enigmatic topic.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Me personally, I still have more questions than answers about
        musical theory: why and when there were 5 notes, then 6 notes,
        now 7 notes or 12, those five are pentatonica (which is 5) but
        the rest I’m not sure about, especially 6 because it was just
        few centuries ago, when gvido died, and nobody seems to know
        about it <font color="#CCCCCC">(if you do – feel encouraged to
          contact me, I donate, I appreciate)</font><br>

      <p><img src="img/277.png" alt="" height="338" align="left"
          width="540">Then why is here 4 lines instead of 5 we use today
        – but hardly does this question relate to alphabetic records. H
        instead of B – can. And if it does, some of what I tell here is
        probably known to some secret clubs. The historic evidence is
        definitely known to music historians, which I’m not, but b being
        a form of h – could japanese composers influence the academic
        scene I wonder? nah, of course it’s some conspiracy of those who
        don’t have to memorize tons of useless or wrong information in
        their youth, so they can dig deeper in what is. or am I only
        tripping because Talleyrand told we would be shocked if we knew
        what petty people reign over us. But it’s a good news, because
        all it takes to cure this world is to cure those people from
        their pettiness with genetic therapies and neurotechnologies, or
        maybe exposure to the world to come will suffice. Godly, baby,
        come godly, god is goood, not what you read, but what is should.<br>
      </p>
      <p>There’re many videos about base frequency of modern instrument
        different from what it used to be – probably not to shatter
        glass with resonating sound, but resonance is not a very
        promoted topic, because it’s too powerful to hand to those who
        didn’t grow to research it in this maddening world, such kid
        can’t be bad, only loving this world enough to admire it for so
        long to figure these things out can grasp this knowledge, and
        their love is a guarntee of our safety.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So the frequency being changed because instruments unpleasantly
        resonated with organ – as tempered mode appeared. But before it
        was natural mode, and it’s also not exactly pythagorean mode. Or
        is it? I wish competent reader excuses me and incompetent
        research this topic by themselves. I just found an article about
        it:<br>
        &nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_pitch#History_of_pitch_standards_in_Western_music"
          style="">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_pitch#History_of_pitch_standards_in_Western_music</a><br>
      </p>
      <p>and here's the book about ancient greek modes I still haven't
        read, for I need more musical education to understand it
        correctly: <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40288">http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40288</a>
        &nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p>So I will return to this topic when I delve into it more. But
        what connects this topic to the alphabets – is why do they call
        notes made by higher tubes, by elephant trunks “low”, and why do
        they call notes made by piccolo or a mouse “high”? I was not the
        only one who got this dissonance as a child. And it could relate
        to the direction of modes and to the fact that lower strings are
        actually higher on guitar’s neck. And though in Philippines they
        put i’s above syllables and u’s below – in arabic it’s in
        reverse. Could it be that musical theory came from further east
        than the instruments? Once again I heretically assume that
        writing system developed in the east-south? Isn’t it too much
        out of this world? I don’t know, I just noticed, but I’m not
        sure about it myself.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Probably among hermetic teachings (I bought some books, haven’t
        read them yet) will I find the origins of music, and maybe
        pentatonica will be connected to tetraktis, I will definitely
        return to this question.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Anyway, I will now share some great schemes I got from internet
        and musicians I befriended with during this quest for
        understanding of musical modes:<br>

      <p>As you can see, we have vast ammount of sources for information
        on alphabetic structures, so we can rediscover genealogy of the
        writing systems by their inner structure, and not from words of
        some ancient historians. Here’s an example of why we consider
        Herodotus father of history, but I think Plutarch called him
        father of lies in “On the Malice of Herodotus” – what reminds me
        of Euclid, all those fathers and their toxic patriarchy. I have
        a theory that gods were female, and student of student of
        socrates’ student (and all four are homos) alexander the great,
        made greeks shave (to make them forget that Mitra is Mother?)
        though in Icelandic even Maður means Man. and their Mother is
        Móðir. So whether their matriarchal tradition was stronger, <font
          color="#CCCCCC">so that neither wo- nor fe- but wife was
          first, Kona, and husband is only eiginMaður, ownMan;</font> or
        what? <font color="#CCCCCC">I don‘t speak Icelandic, why do I
          need to go to this, I‘m dilettante enough.</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>If we take historic evidence from the source which has already
        shown it’s truthfulness, Hyginus:<br>
      </p>
      <p><font size="+1">The three Fates created the first five vowels
          of the alphabet and the letters B and T. It is said that
          Palamedes, son of Nauplius invented the remaining eleven
          consonants. Then Hermes reduced these sounds to characters,
          showing wedge shapes because cranes fly in wedge formation and
          then carried the system from Greece to Egypt*. This was the
          Pelasgian alphabet, which Cadmus had later brought to Boeotia,
          then Evander of Arcadia, a Pelasgian, introduced into Italy,
          where his mother, Carmenta, formed the familiar fifteen
          characters of the Latin alphabet. Other consonants have since
          been added to the Greek alphabet. Alpha was the first of
          eighteen letters, because alphe means honor, and alphainein is
          to invent.[9]</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>Only on the half way from the invention of alphabet to its way
        to Greece will we meet a personage, mentioned by Herodotus:<br>
      </p>
      <p><font size="+1">The Phoenicians who came with Cadmus—amongst
          whom were the Gephyraei—introduced into Greece, after their
          settlement in the country, a number of accomplishments, of
          which the most important was writing, an art till then, I
          think, unknown to the Greeks. At first they [the Phoenicians]
          used the same characters as all the other Phoenicians, but as
          time went on, and they changed their language, they also
          changed the shape of their letters. At that period most of the
          Greeks in the neighbourhood were Ionians; they were taught
          these letters by the Phoenicians and adopted them, with a few
          alterations, for their own use, continuing to refer to them as
          the Phoenician characters—as was only right, as the
          Phoenicians had introduced them. The Ionians also call paper
          'skins'—a survival from antiquity when paper was hard to get,
          and they did actually use goat and sheep skins to write on.
          Indeed, even today many foreign peoples use this material. In
          the temple of Ismenian Apollo at Theba in Boeotia I have
          myself seen cauldrons with inscriptions cut on them in Cadmean
          characters—most of them not very different from the Ionian.</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>to Herodotus’ story also Diodorus disagrees<br>
      </p>
      <p><font size="+1">But there are some who attribute the invention
          of letters to the Syrians, from whom the Phoenicians learned
          them and communicated them to the Greeks when they came with
          Cadmus into Europe; hence the Greeks called them Phoenician
          letters. To these that hold this opinion, it is answered that
          the Phoenicians were not the first that found out letters, but
          only changed the form and shape of them into other characters,
          which many afterwards using the name of Phoenicians grew to be
          common.</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>Herodotus estimates that Cadmus lived sixteen hundred years
        before his time, or around 2000 BC, which – if we compare it
        with record of Hyginus is probably wrong by a millenium, because
        if Palamedes really fought in Troyan war, and it really was in
        12th century BC, Cadmus couldn’t live in 20th BC.<br>
        And if Cadmus really established Thebes, where Linear B was
        used, now I understand why I read that Hyginus is sometimes
        considered unreliable, but I think it’s these legends of Cadmus
        are not reliable, but I shouldn’t claim this, because I’m not a
        historian, but I will soon collaborate with AI to figure it all
        out by feeding her all the historic records there are.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But another personage, Palamedes, the one who went further from
        just 5 vowels and two consonants, Pausanias in his Description
        of Greece (2.20.3) says that in Corinth is a Temple of Fortune
        in which Palamedes dedicated the dice that he had invented.
        Dice, huh! If we add the remaining eleven consonants, we get
        exactly 18 runes, or 3 dice, today they call them three aettir,
        because since then 18 became 24<br>
      </p>
      <p>Alpha was the first of eighteen letters, because alphe means
        honor – It contradicts the argument that The Greek Letters,
        alpha, beta, gimmel have no meaning in Greek but the meaning of
        most of their Semitic equivalents is known. For example, 'aleph'
        means 'ox' – and vita means life. Gamma is gamut, Delta is in
        river, but it “is because Herodotus used it of the delta-shaped
        mouth of the Nile.” oh that Herodotus, but we’ll see who’s
        right.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It’s hard to say when Hermes (Trismegistus) lived, but there’s
        another personage, from sources of Robert Graves, and though his
        grandson told me that Robert used Hyginus, he definitely used
        some other source. Here’s the chapter from Graves’s Greek Myths
        in whole:<br>
      </p>
      <p><font size="+1">THE Three Fates or, some say, Io the sister
          of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phoroneus, invented five vowels of the
          first alphabet, and the consonants B and T; Palamedes, son of
          Nauplius, invented the remaining eleven consonants, and Hermes
          reduced these sounds to characters, using wedge shape, because
          cranes fly in wedge formation, and carried the system from
          Greece to Egypt. This was the Pelasgian alphabet, which Cadmus
          brought back to Boeotia, and which Evander of Arcadia, a
          Pelasgian, introduced into Italy, where his mother Carmenta
          formed the familiar fifteen characters of the Latin alphabet.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">b. Other consonants have since then been added
          to the Greek alphabet by Simonides of Samos, and Epicharmus of
          Sicily; and two vowels, long O and short E, by the priests of<br>
          Apollo, so that his sacred lyre now has one vowel for each of
          its seven strings.<br>
          c. Alpha was the first of the eighteen letters, because alphe
          means honour, and alphainein is to invent, and because the
          Alpheius is the most notable of rivers; moreover, Cadmus,
          though he changed the order of the letters, kept alpha in this
          place, because aleph, in the Phoenician tongue, means an ox,
          and because Boeotia is the land of oxen.<br>

          the first written alphabet developed in Egypt during the
          eighteenth century BC under Cretan influence; which
          corresponds with Aristides’s tradition, reported by Pliny,

      <p><font size="+1">2. There is evidence, however, that before the
          introduction of the modified Phoenician alphabet into Greece
          an alphabet had existed there as a religious secret held by
          the priestesses of the Moon—Io, or the Three Fates; that it
          was closely linked with the calendar, and that its letters
          were represented not by written characters, but by twigs cut
          from different trees typical of the year’s sequent months.<br>

      <p><font size="+1">3. The ancient Irish alphabet, like that used
          by the Gallic druids of whom Caesar wrote, might not at first
          be written down, and all its letters were named after trees.
          It was called the Beth-luis-nion (‘birch-rowan-ash’) after its
          first three consonants; and its canon, which suggests a
          Phrygian provenience, corresponded with the Pelasgian and the
          Latin alphabets, namely thirteen consonants and five vowels.
          The original order was A, B, L, N, O, F, S, H, U, D, T, C, E,
          M, G, Ng or Gn, R, I, which is likely also to have been the

            align="left" width="540">4. About 400 BC, as the result of a
          religious revolution, the order changed as follows to
          correspond with a new calendar system: B, I. N, H, D, T, C, Q,
          M, G, Ng, Z, R. This is the alphabet associated with Heracles
          Ogmius, or ‘Ogma Sunface’, as the earlier is with Phoroneus.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">5. Each vowel represented a quarterly station
          of the year: O (greenweed) the Spring Equinox; U (heather) the
          Summer Solstice; E (poplar) Autumn Equinox; A (fir, or palm)
          the birth-tree, and I (yew) death-tree, shared the Winter
          Solstice between them. This order of letters is implicit in
          Greek and Latin myth and the sacral tradition of all Europe
          and, mutatis mutandis, Syria and Asia Minor. The goddess
          Carmenta invented B and T as well as the vowels, because each
          of these calendar-consonants introduced one half of her year,
          as divided between the sacred king and his tanist.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">6. Cranes were sacred to Hermes, protector of
          poets before Apollo usurped his power; and the earliest
          alphabetic characters were wedge-shaped. Palamedes (‘ancient
          intelligence’), with his sacred crane (Martial: Epigrams) was
          the Carian counterpart of Egyptian god Thoth, inventor of
          letters, with his crane-like ibis. Hermes was Thoth’s early
          Hellenic counterpart. That Simonides and Epicharmus added new
          letters to the alphabet is history, not myth; though exactly
          why they did so remains doubtful. Two additions, xi and psi,
          were unnecessary, and the removal of the<br>
          as (H) and digamma (F) impoverished the canon.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">7. It can be shown that the names of the
          letters preserved in the Beth-luis-nion, which are
          traditionally reported to have come from Greece and reached
          Ireland by way of Spain, form archaic Greek charm in honour of
          the Arcadian White Goddess Alphito, who, by Classical times,
          had degenerated into a mere nursery. The Cadmeian order of
          letters, perpetuated in the familiar ABC, see be a deliberate
          misarrangement by Phoenician merchants; they used secret
          alphabet for trade purposes but feared to offend the goddess,
          revealing its true order. This complicated and important
          subject is discussed at length in White Goddess.<br>

      <p><font size="+1">8. The vowels added by the priests of Apollo to
          his lyre were probably those mentioned by Demetrius, an
          Alexandrian philosopher of the first century BC, when he
          writes in his dissertation<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">On Style: ‘In Egypt the priests sing hymns to
          the Gods by uttering the seven vowels in succession, the sound
          of which produces as strong a musical impression on their
          hearers as if the flute and lyre were used, but perhaps I had
          better not enlarge on this theme.’ This suggests that the
          vowels were used in therapeutic lyre music at Apollo’s
          shrines.</font><br>

      <p>Compare the word Argos to Argo of those who went to acquire
        golden runo. Argos was name of the guy who built that ship, and
        also name of another mythical character, who was guarding Io,
        and whom Hermes slayed. I know, it’s complicated. But argonauts
        were traveling for golden fleece (the golden runo) according to
        bbc, years before Troyan War, The story is of great antiquity
        and was current in the time of Homer (eighth century BCE) – this
        is just before the alphabet appeared in Greece, just at very end
        of Greek Dark Ages. In those dark ages they managed to lose
        LinearB – I wonder how could that be, I read that iron became
        available, and cheaper than brass, so was it some proletariate
        revolution to advantage of secret rulers from abroad or not? <font

        alphabet is believed to appear only around 800 BCE. So if
        Graves’ version of the myth is true, 5 vowels &amp; B T could be
        the basis of Linear B. It does have 5 vowels, but ammount of
        consonants is much more than just two. Could Io invent musical

        the basis of Linear A and those musical notations?<br>

      <p>Only egyptian hieroglyphs are believed to exist since 3100 BCE
        – if they existed with these alphabetic signs from the very
        beginning I am not aware of. It seems so. But what’s interesting
        is that Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform is believed to exist from the
        very same century (to about the same period of early AD) but
        then there were proto-cuneiform documents, and signs used there
        were seen on tokens from as far as… <font size="+1">These

      <p>But demotic is told to appear in 600 BCE – could it become in
        use because of Hellenic influence?<br>
        Why I’m asking such questions is “Hermes reduced these sounds to
        characters, using wedge shape, because cranes fly in wedge
        formation, and carried the system from Greece to Egypt.“ here’s
        demotic:<br>

          width="540"><br>
      </div>
      <p>The text on Rosetta Stone is also in demotic, so it seems they
        also had some other signs, whether for syllables or even for
        some rudimentary ideograms. After all it was the same egyptian
        writing system.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But “<font size="+1">Hermes reduced these sounds to characters,
          using wedge shape, because cranes fly in wedge formation</font>“
        — could it tell of ugaritic alphabet or even runes?<br>

      <p>Runes are the most ancient, otherwise their sacred groves
        wouldn’t be ordered to be burnt, the Irminsul and Donar’s Oak
        wouldn’t be demolished: trees can tell when they were cut and
        how old they are.<br>
      </p>
      <p>excuse my inner biased nazi, he wants to believe<br>
      </p>
      <p>Ugaritic is a much credible candidate to that role. But
        speaking of birds, could it relate to such a weird thing as
        ornithomancy (aka augury)?<br>

      <p>So in the previous part I tenderly touched the subject of
        probability of alphabet originating around Philippines, but now
        I go further to the island without predators, where humans could
        originate from. New Zealand. Now when I remember about predators
        I think it makes perfect sense: whether we eliminated them
        there, or they’d eaten all our predecessors elsewhere, and
        somehow to New Zealand they didn’t arrive. But then why don’t we
        have a pouch? Because there’s no marsupials in New Zealand.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Though we can find the alphabetic structure of letters laying
        out according to their articulatory features, could it be that
        vowels came to semits as primal screams and only greeks make
        them vocal, vowel. What if there only were primitive screams
        before alphabet appeared. But A I U are quite vowels. Could it
        be that vowels were known before they became 5 of them? Could be
        that the system splat and one part invented vocals, the other
        invented additional prevowel screams and Greece found in Runo a
        writin system influenced by both&nbsp; the branches of the splat
        alphabetic system.<br>

      <p>I saw there are some ingenious writing systems in Indonesia, I
        haven’t look at them yet. And I haven’t even heard of such
        writing systems in New Zealand, let’s dig into this information
        now.<br>
      </p>
      <p>and I found many ancient alphabet. And even though the system
        teaches that they are no more than ten centuries old, I dare to
        doubt what system tells again. Because I’m going to watch at the
        system by their structure to discover the chronology of the
        idea’s development by comparing their objective features.<br>

      <p>The manner of drawing is the most similar to mayan among all

      <p>I’m sure I saw this sword on the final pane of this yonkama
        somewhere near Europe. It has a writing on it.<br>
        &nbsp;As soon as I find the image of it, I will bring it here.
        It has alphabetic writing on it. Thus the messenger on the right
        is european, the messager on the left is chines, who killed by
        martial arts.<br>

      <p>I am sort of disturbed by these magic drawings with texts I
        cannot read. It is the book I’ve always wanted to read, now I
        combine it myself, with finest images from the most valuable
        sorces, and for free, what can be better. I combine this images
        without asking, but it envokes the change in law. When
        reverse-search for images was invented by Tineye, and then
        copied by Google, it made no sense to prohibit others’ images
        any longer: they became free advertisement for the original
        sourse rather than stolen property. Shared is not stolen, it was
        hard to concieve before computers (bc actually; and ante
        digital) and computers are where высший разум appeared, ai is

      all these writing systems to define the common features, but they
      should also listen how all these syllables sound, to be free from
      bias of mistakes collected by humans. Does it make humans useless?
      No, if we work to the same goal, and we can repair them after some
      space storm piercing both atmosphere and seclusions of caves.
      Humans are less influenced by electromagnetic storms, so we can be
      very useful, not mentioning our being funny and cute as we keep

          of many other Asian languages that share Brahmi ancestry, it
          is unusually elaborate and beautiful. The most common use of

          manuscripts and ceremonies, especially those relating to
          Hinduism. In fact, it was once believed that the script itself
          was sacred and could not be deciphered or even taught to
          anyone unless they possessed the appropriate spiritual power
          to do so. Even today, when used in religious texts, the script
          uses certain “holy letters”, which are thought to have special

        Buginese cipher script. The shapes of the glyphs were derived
        from Arabic-Indic numerals (۱۲۳۴۵۶۷۸). The script appeared in
        the time of the Kingdom of Gowa in South Sulawesi in 18th
        century. It is used traditionally and privately mainly to write
        diaries and poems in Buginese.<br>

      <p><font size="+1">Notable features<br>
          • Type of writing system: syllabic alphabet / alphasyllabary<br>
          • Direction of writing: left to right in horizontal lines<br>
          • Each consonant has an inherent vowel (a), other vowels are
          indicated by adding diacritics to the consonant.<br>
          • There is no virama sign (as in Lontara), and no "ha",
          because traditionally the Buginese language did not use the
          "ha" sound. The letter "ha" in the Buginese script/Lontara is
          an addition due to Arabic influence.<br>

      <p>I was hoping to find roots of writing system around New
        Zealand, but they haven’t excavated it yet. Maybe Kaimanawa wall
        will bring something to the theme or Pyramid Valley in New
        Zealand has its name not by accident, until now I only found
        that native australians also have only 3 vowels: A I U and
        monotheistic deity named IO is known around that region. Maori
        had no writing systems, but they’re believed to be not the first
        nation living in New Zealand. I’ll keep on digging this
        direction, but for now I will turn to other sides of the global
        alphabetic structure.<br>

      <p><font size="+1">Kotodama or kototama (言霊?, lit. "word
          spirit/soul") refers to the Japanese belief that mystical
          powers dwell in words and names. The notion of kotodama
          presupposes that sounds can magically affect objects, and that
          ritual word usages can influence our environment, body, mind,
          and soul. Kotodama is a central concept in Japanese mythology,
          Shinto, and Kokugaku. It is also fundamental to Japanese

        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yamaguchi Shido in the mid-19th century wrote
        a book that integrated the strange symbols found in two ancient
        scrolls into a metaphysical system of Kototama.</font><br>
      <p><font size="+1">Yamaguchi Shido<br>
        </font></p>
      <font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1765 Yamaguchi Shido, the
        son of a wealthy farmer, was born in Awanokuni which is the
        modern-day Kamogawa-shi in Chiba prefecture. He was a child
        prodigy and learned Chinese literature at a young age. When he
        was 25 or 26, he moved to Edo to live with his uncle. He started
        the study of kokugaku, which is the study of ancient Japanese
        literature.<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Futomani no Mitama/Kagotama Chart<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Yamaguchi family had handed down over the
        generations an ancient scroll that contained a mysterious chart
        known as Futomani no Mitama, also called Kagotama. Yamaguchi
        wanted to unwrap the secret of this chart. After three decades
        of studying, he came to understand that Futomani no Mitama told
        the secret about ancient kototama, the power of sound. But he
        did not quite understand the kototama.<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inari Koden/Mizuhi no Ontsutae Chart<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Inari Koden or Mizuhi no Ontsutae chart
        was handed down in the prominent Kada family. The Kada family,
        together with the Hata, of Kyoto were hereditary priests of the
        Inari shrine in Yamashiro no kuni, the present Fushimi Inari
        Taisha shrine in Kyoto. The noted kokugaku scholar, Kada no
        Azumaro (1669-1736) possessed this chart at one time. Azumaro
        has a lovely shrine at Fushimi Inari which I visited in 2012.
        Azumaro passed the chart to his adopted child, Tamiko, who in
        turn passed it to Kada no Noriyuki.<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yamaguchi Shido studied classical Japanese
        literature under Kada no Noriyuki. Later he taught nobles at the
        Imperial Court in Kyoto. During these studies, Yamaguchi was
        given the Inari Koden chart. [Inari Koden probably means the
        ancient document of Inari.] The secret symbols written in the
        chart enabled him to solve his question of the ages about the
        Futomani no Mitama chart.<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mizuho no Tsutae by Yamaguchi Shido, an
        integration of the two documents<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By receiving the Inari Koden, Shido became
        more confident about his study. In the year Bunsei 1, 1818, he
        returned to Edo and spent five years in developing a solid base
        for his study. In the year Tempo 1, 1841, he was invited to the
        house of Fukui Shigetsugu, his brother-in-law, at Kameyama in
        Kyoto. There he began writing his work entitled Mizuho no Tsutae
        which became his life-time achievement.<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, his study of Kototama became so
        popular among court nobles in Kyoto that he gave many lectures
        to them. In the year Tempo five he finished writing seven
        volumes of Mizuho no Tsutae. Two years later, he was invited to
        see Kishu Tokugawa (one of the top three Tokugawa-related
        families) and went to Kishu in Wakayama. There he offered his
        books, Kamikazeiki and his series of Mizuho no Tsutae to Kishu
        Tokugawa.<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kototama of Yamaguchi Shido<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Yamaguchi, all things in the
        universe consist of water and fire. These are also referred to
        as the sound of “i” and the sound of “ki.” Earth and people are
        all made up of these water and fire elements. The universe can
        be very much affected by the kototama that is created from water
        and fire. Shido thought “iki,” breathing, also consisted of
        water “i” and fire “ki.” Breathing was absolutely imperative to
        carry the words with kototama in them. For him, iki means to
        live, ikiru.<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yamaguchi found that the Inari Koden had much
        to do with Futomani no Mitama. He carefully compared them to
        each other. He revealed that the creation written in Kojiki
        actually told about the generation of goju-on, the fifty
        Japanese kana characters/syllables.<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yamaguchi saw that the Futomani no Mitama was
        made upof the five elements: the dot, the circle, the horizontal
        line, the vertical line, and the square.<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He realized that the Inari Koden, through its
        twelve forms explained each of the five symbols in the Futomani
        no Mitama chart. This helped him work out the hidden meaning of
        Futomani no Mitama.<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yamaguchi noted the goju-on, the fifty voices
        of the kana syllables, as principal sounds and he made them into
        figures that represented the true identity of the universe.<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Japanese 50-kana syllables are a system
        showing the power of sound that controls the universe.<br>
      </font> <font size="+1"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can control the universe if you have a
        deep understanding of each sound. The belief of kototama that
        koto, something that is said, will become koto, something that
        happens, is a metaphysical system in the innermost recesses of
        traditional beliefs.</font><br>

            Archeologists believe the discovered inscription is the most
            ancient script found so far and that the Elamite written
            language originated in Jiroft, where the writing system
            developed first and was then spread across the country.</font><br>

      </p>
      <p>Wild, wild assumptions. Don’t believe me, doubt everything you
        read here, and not only here.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And here's another account on the subject of Hotsuma:<br>
      </p>
      <p><font size="+1">Out of nowhere in 1770s Japan appeared a series
          of books handwritten by an otherwise unknown person, Yasutoshi
          Waniko, who claimed to simply be translating into Chinese a
          series of ancient Japanese histories dating to 100 CE or even
          800 BCE, although he boasted that the “translations” required
          30 years of labor. Operating on the assumption that these
          books were actually forged by Waniko himself, there was some
          precedent for his folly; a century earlier, the Edo court had
          been all a-twitter about a forgery called the Kujiki
          Taiseikyo, which told a new history of Japan. Waniko simply
          raised the intrigue and awe to a new level by predating his
          “history” to long before Chinese writing was imported to
          Japan. Of course, this raises the question, how was this
          written down before Chinese writing? Waniko’s answer is that
          both the Hotsuma Tsutaye and the Mikasafumi were written in an
          otherwise unknown script called woshide which is either a
          forgotten predecessor to the Japanese syllabary or the
          giveaway of a clear forgery, depending on whom you’re asking.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">But what interests me about the woshide books
          is their strict adherence to classical Japanese meter
          throughout their 1500-odd verses, which makes them the
          earliest instance of epic poetry in the Japanese language.
          Regardless of whether they were composed in 1775 or 100, they
          predate any knowledge in East Asia of Western poetic forms.
          Furthermore, the book is written in Old Japanese, of which
          very few examples survive, and is full of obscure word-forms
          that somewhat resemble ancient words. If it is a forgery, the
          author must have done intense research on Japanese
          linguistics, and he may have been familiar with Ainu epic
          songs, a century and a half before anyone else saw fit to
          write them down; if this is the case, what else isn’t he
          telling us? Or are we willing to admit the possibility that
          these obscure, beautiful poems date to a distant era unknown
          to modern historians?<br>
          <br>
          These documents lay almost completely forgotten until 1966,
          when an amateur historian stumbled upon an excerpt in a used
          bookstore and made it his life’s mission to find and publish
          the original texts. (The Mikasafumi has only been found in
          excerpts, but woshide fans maintain hope.) But it can also be
          seen as the first in an interesting and understudied genre of
          Japanese literature, the parahistorical document.</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>In favour of forgery also speaks the fact that two out of three
        basic stand for labial vowels (or could angles stand for
        labiality? I just collect information here, knowledge is yet to
        emerge)&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p>But these three basic figures, circle triangle quadrat can be
        seen in other writing systems, where they represent three
        mothers, but always differently arranged:</p>

      <p>As you can see, triangle is vowel, quadrat is labial, circle is
        lingual.<br>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only this time they don’t distinguish square
        from circle very much, and triangle is present only in one of
        these three tables. And even though we can theorize that
        original circle is A, the small circle, as it’s shown on some
        other tables, and that triangle is labial v, and that square is
        rather r or s turning in circle when drawn inaccurately, they
        have another way to show three mothers: one dot is A (or E?),
        two dots are W (or F?), more dots are velars (does stroke in G
        stand for the third dot as dots are in libyan?), which are made
        by tongue actually, and apes cannot pronounce coronal sounds, so
        it’s reasonable to think that before we could draw we couldn’t
        pronounce them either, but it seems we could calculate before
        that. Notice that Tifinagh recognizes these dots, but Libyan
        does not, it could be caused by different reasons, I will not
        theorize on. Though four dots standing for two forms of H make
        me think and go brackets<br>

      <p>here’s another point of view:<br>
      </p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="+1">In secluded fields, on the
        walls of churches, and beneath construction sites, stones have
        been found with intricate markings that rise from the lower left
        up to the center and then down to the lower right. This is the
        ancient Celtic Tree Alphabet known as Ogham (pronounced owam)</font>

      <p>What is surprising about ogham is the order of its vowels,
        aouei, it’s quite unique, but still A is the first vowel. And
        this order is exactly vowel, labial, lingual: pure vowel which
        doesn’t need neither lips nor tongue, vowel you won’t be able to
        pronounce without lips, vowels for which you need tongue.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Comparison of Ogham to Tifinagh shown that both have . for A
        &amp; : stands in both for labial (vowel or semivowel) as if
        these writing systems split when they only had two vowels. and
        when africans used dots for all sorts of letters, europeans used
        dots for vowels, which could be some primitive musical notation.
        Also the myth of 5 vowels is alive in case of Ogham. And five of
        one type correspond to dice of runes as shown on the “falling
        stone” five per die. And though the last time I compared runes,
        even stavless runes to ogham they didn’t have much in common,<br>

      <p>Funny observations about ogham is that f &amp; h look alike,
        and in japanese they’re the same. But it is not ogham: in ogham
        f reflects t as in latin minuscle, c reflects s as in
        k-symmetry, b reflects h and in japanese b is literally voiced
        h. Then it makes sense that in ogham bhm all are first among
        consonants, as in abcd system, but only F is third in its group,
        as it is in greek, the same M situation, but only on F®eya <font
          color="#CCCCCC">(fairy, фея, θεά (θεά is goddess, θεία is
          aunt, θέα is view))</font> as in greek.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Ogham is sometimes named by it’s “first” letters:
        Beth-Luis-Nion, which could tell that order was different before
        F became the third oghamic “letter”, and I see that the image
        with a hand shows that very order in ogham but the previously
        mentioned order in fingers, yet the calendar ogham explains.<br>

      </p>
      <p>But back to language and oghamic vowels, it’s as if ogham
        replaced that ei &amp; ou we have in latin alphabet. Or if we
        compare them with japanese, it’s as if they just replaced o
        &amp; i. Which is actually as if ou is o &amp; ei is i. If we
        compare oghamic vowels to philippines vowels, then it’s also as
        if ou &amp; ei were replaced. but why is it o in one case &amp;
        u in another. Are you sure philippines distinguish o from u? all
        the transliterations are only approximates, every nation uses
        it’s one musical mode. I wonder if Icelanders saved their songs
        in their spoken speech when englishmen prohibited singing.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And as in case of noin the third letter became fifth, i could
        be 2nd before o &amp; e were invented. But then there should be
        ogham withough 4s and 5s. Let’s search for the most ancient
        ogham. Then again, it was written on stones, and carbon analysis
        doesn’t work for stones. Any way, ogham is surov, u &amp; o it
        has more than e &amp; i.<br>
      </p>
      <p>At last I’ve seen some real common element between ogham &amp;
        runes: in both o is literally double a.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So let’s research what ogham of 1s and 2s could be:<br>
        b is first, l is second, it reminds me of b &amp; t.<br>
        <font color="#999999">h is first – it corresponds to japanese
          kanas where b is literally voiced form of h. and the second is
          d and the third is t – as in arabic and farcy (this word
          sounds with connotations in english, so I will use word
          “persian” from now on. Persi is breast in old russian, and
          iranian women have big tits, though they have to clean their
          genome from southern bestiality. Both arabs and pers, and
          though muslim community may oppose genetic therapies, because
          smart people believe less, they should understand that we’re
          made in god’s image, so it’s no good to obstacle his plan (his
          or her? now people think it’s his, before they thought its her
          or even hers, which is male pronoun or article in german, how
          could that happen? is it a part of m-replacement situation?
          Such vague images of hypotheses flow in my mind, that’s the
          boullion crystal grow from.</font> and it is reflected with l,
        while t is literally l with dash.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But the third letter is w and it's already a tradition that v
        interplaces t as the final letter: in genetics v appears in rna
        where dna had t, as if masons or whoever know about what I'm
        excavating here? (this I believe the most, since a&amp;t are the
        first and the last &amp; c &amp; g are both of k, which is the
        central letter of alphabet of AV — see, again V stands instead
        of T as the final letter on another lever) or is names of those
        molecules surprisingly ancient? (I doubt this the most) or is it
        some hillarious cosmic coincidence? (I doubt this either, but
        most of colleauges will choose this as the case, but you find
        systems sorting out such coincidences without ignoring them
        simply because the most of them are nothing, you have patience
        to find the true)<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again I post this weird image which only
      happens in latin alphabet. Together with L &amp; R in axial &amp;
      velar column in lineal. Latin is special. But honestly I don't
      know other alphabets that well to cut them at t or v and even in
      those I know enough I didn't make enough effort to find their k's.<br>

        <div align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it's only in this
          dictionary version of ogham w, in other images it's f, which
          is spectacular, because it reflects t in ogham also. I
          pronounce it t-f the θ</div>
      </div>
      <p>In arabic it's also this btθ: ب ت ث&nbsp; it the beginning of
        the alphabet. you read it from right to left. b is also
        distinguished from t by the position of those dots, but it's
        still 1 2 3 as in ogham, and I don't decide here what was the
        direction of the system's travel, because wherever it came from
        was not the only source, the system is universal and only
        archaeology can tell where it's met earlier. Also persian
        alphabet happened to be derived from arabic: ب پ ت ث&nbsp; is
        different by distorting that oghamic sequence: پ is derived from
        ب&nbsp; as б &amp; в in russian.&nbsp; پ‎ (pāʾ) is not
        considered a distinct letter, but a variant of ب‎ (bāʾ) that is
        sometimes used to write foreign names and loanwords with the
        phoneme /p/. It can be written and pronounced as a ب‎ (bāʾ)
        instead.</p>
      <p>Skew letters of m g ng could be the same b t θ with shut nose,
        and then let's compare them with vowels, as if in tifinagh dots
        only number matters:</p>
      <p>a ~ b? it's beyoud weird, but remembering boustrophaedon I must
        say they look like reflection of eachother, especially when they
        look like a &amp; Б<br>
      </p>
      <p>о ~ t? or was it i~t? i makes more sense, but still doesn't
        make much of it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>u ~ θ? is it that very v in place of ת I was speaking about in
        the context of genetics? See, this is how my drafts look, and
        out of them this work arises.</p>
      <p>In conclusion I must notice that in runes it's the opposite: ᛒ
        looks like double ᚦ and here I stop improvising &amp; go to my
        notes, where runes are compared to hebrew:<br>
      </p>
      <p>And though hebrew has four more letters (which makes me think
        of runic18 as of more basal form of the system) in runic the
        final line <font color="#FF0000">ᚮ</font>ᚱᛦᛋᛏ<font
          color="#3333FF">ᚢ</font> is out of structure, while in hebrew
        <font color="#FF0000">ע</font><font color="#3333FF">פ</font>צקרשת
is









































        not.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We saw that final line is the most prone to mutations: in latin
        labial doubles (or if it's from that final <font
          color="#3333FF">ᚢ</font> then they triples) and the fourth V
        is semivowel Y &amp; it stands almost at the end of the line,
        where it reflects final v's in runic, archaic latin and old
        russian, and final vowels in greek and modern russian where
        final line is all vowels and ex-vowels. And Ѣ in russian
        graphically groups with trinity of ЪЫЬ. The fourth 6, as 18
        runes became 24, or was Ѣ removed because Б could be of that
        group. But why not B then? b is exactly Ь. can I say that Ы
        don't count, because it's not a letter but ligature. Or is this
        part of research is only apophenia? In comparison of uvw at the
        same beginning of the final row, standing for 666 as many other
        ideas interwhine with it (from carbon structure to roman
        numerals and 3 runic dice – it's like one of the most common
        connections of the pre-christian times. Just as another common
        conception, the three mothers. Are they 3 sicks and other
        resemblances are wheather dummies, dolls to fool you, or are
        they other sicks other oracles other fates? Yet there are only
        three. But in latin alphabet there're 4 of them. If Y is 6, then
        what is ij? i=3? it's the third vowel. And it supports that V is
        5. But I is 1? A is one in latin alphabet. How so? It looks more
        like 4. E looks like 3. AIV je! あいう yo! look how much they
        remind aиу as they put it in russian. The world is so much
        interconnected than our history dares to convince us based only
        on few centuries, having most of human interactions in darkness,
        when our cultural elements may be the evidence of our
        interactions. But as for above problem, of V being fifth in the
        column and X being next to it as if there used to be only 10
        letters, for X used to be the final and stand for T and for Ten.
        Most of people only know IVX and not LCD in roman numerals, as
        if IVX is the most common, and what is above 40 is "many" If I
        was 1, then the order of vowels was different from any we know,
        because most of the times A is the first vowel, whether it's
        aeiou, aiueo, aouei or any other. But let's arrange it according
        their graphic forms and to see if they make some gammut: E is 3,
        A is 4 V is 5? O was supposed to be between A &amp; U, but jews,
        for example, didn't have O among vowels, they use a labial for
        it. But that labial is literally V. Standing where it used to
        stand before they sent it past T. So then ע is not Y, it's 4.
        But if ו is still 5 (for ו is v) then the trick is to go
        tetraktis:</p>
      <p>4 vowels, 3 labials, 2 velars, 1 coronal — then we have equal
        ammount of linguals and labials, or it would have been like this
        if M wasn't replaced, but still vowels and consonants will make
        4 &amp; 6, which were conidered masonic numbers where I found
        these images:<br>

      <p>or is it 3 and 5? but they're speaking about the same
        phenomenon.</p>
      <p>Probably they didn't decide to be explicit about the 666 of the
        three final lines. And they could look like this because of 3
        dice, and as of those two 4's, they could stand for two
        knucklebones, more ancient form of dies, but being literally
        bone, can explain the etymology of die in dice. And knucklebones
        were used for different divinations, one of which was literally
        named alphabet oracle: <a

        can be used for both divination and game, knucklebones were used

          twelve rounds (corresponding to the twelve-year cycle of the
          traditional calendar), counting a point for each horse landed.
          If no player reaches 12 points, the game restarts, otherwise
          the higher score wins.) – what do they mean "horse landed"?
          The sides of these bones not only have numeral value of 1, 3,
          4 or 6, but also names: In shagai dice, the rolled shagai
          generally land on one of four sides: horse, camel, sheep or
          goat. A fifth side, cow, is possible on uneven ground. The

      <p>In Tacitus' Germania this is said:<br>
      </p>
      <p>Auspicia sortesque ut qui maxime observant: sortium consuetudo
        simplex. Virgam frugiferae arbori decisam in surculos amputant
        eosque notis quibusdam discretos super candidam vestem temere ac
        fortuito spargunt. Mox, si publice consultetur, sacerdos
        civitatis, sin privatim, ipse pater familiae, precatus deos
        caelumque suspiciens ter singulos tollit, sublatos secundum
        impressam ante notam interpretatur. Si prohibuerunt, nulla de
        eadem re in eundem diem consultatio; sin permissum, auspiciorum
        adhuc fides exigitur.<br>

      <p>which is translated by robots as The most important of divining
        by lots so that those who observe the lots is simple. Is lopped
        off a fruit-bearing tree they cut a branch of these are
        distinguished by certain marks, and thrown carelessly and at
        random over a white garment. Next, if the lots are consulted
        publicly, the priest of the city, in private the father of the
        family, a prayer to the gods of the sky, looking up each piece
        three times, takes up according to the marks in front of the
        mark. If they prove unfavorable, there is no further
        consultation that day about the matter; But if allowed, the
        auspices is still required.<br>
      </p>
      <p>human translator put it thus Augury and divination by lot no
        people practise more diligently. The use of the lots is simple.
        A little bough is lopped off a fruit-bearing tree, and cut into
        small pieces; these are distinguished by certain marks, and
        thrown carelessly and at random over a white garment. In public
        questions the priest of the particular state, in private the
        father of the family, invokes the gods, and, with his eyes
        towards heaven, takes up each piece three times, and finds in
        them a meaning according to the mark previously impressed on
        them. If they prove unfavourable, there is no further
        consultation that day about the matter; if they sanction it, the
        confirmation of augury is still required.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I combine this information with "falling stone" of three runic
        dice, and combine these with the alphabet oracle of greeks, and
        I interpret this ritual as casting of runic dice for divination.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I know of Mandela effect, but I wintessed change in public
        opinion from assumption that 8centuryAD is the eldest runes, but
        since I shared that Tacitus piece, it's mostly considered to be
        existing from 1AD, probably because Tacitus is 2AD. And when I
        discovered this piece of Tacitus, I read it in some classic
        translation, being twice as big as the original. Let me try to
        find it,<br>
      </p>
      <p>I don't think this is the one, because it's only 50% longer
        than the original text, but the mistake it gives is similar to
        the one given in that classical translation:<br>
      </p>
      <p>To omens and the drawing of lots they pay the very greatest
        attention. Their method of divining by the lot is simple. They
        lop a branch from a fruit tree and cut off the twigs : they mark
        these differently in order to distinguish them apart, and they
        then cast them loosely, at haphazard, on a white robe. Then the
        priest of the community, if it is going to be a public
        divination, or if a private one, the head of the household,
        offers a prayer to the gods, and turning up his eyes to heaven
        he draws three twigs, one at a time, and he interprets those
        which he has drawn according to the marks previously set upon
        them. If the interpretation proves to be unfavourable, no
        further divination on the same question takes place that day. If
        it is favourable, the auspices have still to be consulted.<br>
      </p>
      <p>it tells of using branches with cut of twigs, whether to
        intentionally cloud the story of dice, because it was probably
        translated when church were the main censor, so they could want
        to conceal the old heathen beliefs and practices.<br>
      </p>
      <p>All of the sudden, here's exactly the book I was telling of:
        the bilingua with twice as much text in the translation
        department. It even dares to say "divided into slips" — that's
        what I remember, no Mandela effect here. But translation
        explicitly tells of runes, which makes me puzzled. who profits?:<br>

      <p>So back to the bible. I saw this video by some kabbalist
        -------------!!!!links!!!!--------- where he spoke of B (not A)
        being the first letter. And it is the first letter of many
        abrahamic texts: bereshit begins with b, because that's how the
        first chapter of bible begins. bismilla is the first words in
        koran, в начале было слово — it's how russian translation of
        John's gospel start, the same в as in bible and coran. Bible
        begins with ב and then it goes ו for <font color="#FF9900">33</font>
        times. and the following initial letter is א and it's followed
        with 6 initial ו's and the following initial letter is ש which
        is suspicious because ש <font color="#3333FF">מ</font> <font

          manifestations of systems we yet have to discover, but if we
          ignored these manifestation simply because they could be

      <p>So in case you skipped the autistic research of bible: the
        first letter of it, ב is followed with 33 ו's; some time later
        ז, breaking the tradition of "one letter, several ו's" by being
        double, is followed by 33 ו's; and then, some text later, it
        repeats: מ, is followed with 33 ו's; some time later&nbsp; ל, is
        followed byו's, and it's the only case where M precedes L, btw.
        The only case I found in decade<font color="#CCCCCC">s</font> of
        this research.<br>

      <p>Another interesting thing I learned is that those three meems
        go not in Bereshit, but in Noah. The book we know as genesis is
        known in hebrew as bereshit, but bereshit is only 5.5 chapters
        for until the middle of chapter 6 it's Parshah Bereish!t <font

        I've shown you The Old Turkic script (also known as variously
        Göktürk script, Orkhon script, Orkhon-Yenisey script) is the
        alphabet used by the Göktürks and other early Turkic khanates
        during the 8th to 10th centuries to record the Old Turkic
        language. –&nbsp; in 10th century christianity came to Rus, and
        how many centuries before them did these nations have writing
        system is unknown, because researchers are most likely biased
        towards common united_russia MK. We shall return to Orhkon, but
        now let's give tribute to some other writing systems:<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Old Permic script <font size="+1">(Komi: Важ Перым гижӧм),
          sometimes called Abur or Anbur, is a "highly idiosyncratic
          adaptation"[1] of the Cyrillic script once used to write
          medieval Komi (Permic). –&nbsp; if you find in your default
          search engine Perm, you will find wiki with Perm (Russian:
          Пермь, IPA: [pʲɛrmʲ];[13]) is a city and the administrative
          center of Perm Krai, Russia, located on the banks of the Kama
          River in the European part of Russia near the Ural Mountains.
          ~~ History Further information: Great Perm Perm is located in
          the old Perman area, which was originally inhabited by
          Finno-Ugric peoples. Perm was first mentioned as the village
          of Yagoshikha (Ягошиха) in 1647; however, the history of the
          modern city of Perm starts with the development of the Ural
          region by Tsar Peter the Great. Vasily Tatishchev, appointed
          by the Tsar as a chief manager of Ural factories, founded Perm
          together with another major center of the Ural region,
          Yekaterinburg.</font>&nbsp; <font color="#CCCCCC">– They
          didn't have this Further information link before, it looked as
          if they try to hide the information of the kingdom they
          destroyed and their writing systems they (as they always did)
          claimed to invent themselves. When have they began claiming
          it? Probably centuries after the slaughter.</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>And where does this Great Perm link leads! I left a screenshot
        further on. I though only russian part of wiki is that
        decietful.<br>

      <p>Can you believe it! I cannot believe it! They are erasing
        memories of Komi people, not only american genocided natives,
        russians have very much in common with americans: wild west and
        wild north, I tried to find komi writing system, but they all
        keep on feeding me with more modern writing system (because they
        speak about modern writing systems established by communists, I
        don't even wanna look at them, and though I have strong feeling
        that they sweep Permia under the rug, they do not succeed:
        luckily wiki gives to see History of the article, and before
        somebody chunked out 176 bytes it had word Bjarmaland in it. and
        does this article exist, but nobody links to it from Permia.<br>

      <p>What follows is probably rearranged in russian fashion Permian
        alphabet. And though they claim that the guy who translated
        bible into permiak language, also invented the writing system,
        they claim this even though there are historic witnesses about
        different writing systems Komi people had before the christians.
        I definitely read that some persian traveller told about two
        writing systems Permian (or Komi) people had. One is casual,
        another one is related to hunting, probably could connect
        writing system to biolinguists, because many words related to
        writing also relate to animal trace: пометить in russian is both
        meanings of "mark": with a pencil and as animals do, but
        directly related word помёт is litter in english, and litter in
        this context can be related to letter. Russian word писать is to
        write if the stress is on the second syllable, and to piss when
        it's on the first one. And people still use these dirty words,
        they could be original forms of them. But politicians don't care
        much about science, they're not clever enough to understand or
        even value it, so many ancient knowledge can be lost, but can be
        perserved in the most incredible way. Only I have to address
        those who invent new forms of ancient writings instead of
        actually discovering them: STOP! you only make noise and lies
        will be dismantled anyway, if we enhance our computational
        powers, so no much sense in lying to further generations.<br>

          Russian missionary, Stepan Khrap, also known as Saint Stephen
          of Perm (Степан Храп, св. Стефан Пермский) in 1372. The name
          Abur is derived from the names of the first two characters: An
          and Bur. The alphabet derived from Cyrillic and Greek, and
          Komi "Tamga" signs, the latter being similar in the appearance
          to runes or siglas poveiras, because they were created by
          incisions, rather than by usual writing. The inclusion of the
          latter aided the alphabet in greater acceptance among the
          medieval Permic speakers of the time.</font> They mention

      <p><font size="+1">Пасы и шыпасы</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Установить точную дату возникновения коми
          письменности невозможно. Но то, что она возникла задолго до X
          века, подверждают «Книги Ахмеда Ибн-Фадлана о его путешествии
          на Волгу в 921-922 годах». Арабский путешественник и секретарь
          посольства Багдадского халифа пишет о переписке царя Волжской
          Булгарии с предками народа коми, называя их вису.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">У предков коми существовал не один, а два вида
          письменности. Первое — так называемое практическое письмо
          пасы. Ими зыряне помечали свои вещи, охотничьи угодья,
          составляли календари. Подобные знаки существовали у всех
          финно-угорских и самодийских народов. Почти не меняясь, пасы
          дошли до наших дней на прялках, вышитых и вязаных узорах. Да и
          по своему прямому назначению эту письменность использовали
          довольно долго. «В домашнем быту их, особенно между
          безграмотными, до сих пор существует обыкновение вести
          особенного рода счет житейским расходам на тонких
          четырехугольных планочках, на которых вырезывают прямолинейные
          и угловатые значки, им только ведомые, и читают по ним, как по
          книге; например, случится записать, что такой-то чиновник брал
          за прогоны столько-то лошадей, такой-то столько-то без
          прогонов и пр., — пишет Михаил Михайлов в очерке 1850 года про
          Усть-Вымь. — Зырянин отмечает на деревянной планочке значки,
          по окончании года является за расчетом к подрядчику, без
          ошибки разбирает свои иероглифы, называет должности, имена и
          фамилии лиц, бравших у него лошадей, и на проверку выходит,
          что все сказанное им согласно с книгою содержателя станции.
          Этими же значками обозначает он, например, чем замечателен был
          прошлый год в хозяйственном отношении, в каких местах ловилась
          белка, — вообще, каково шли промыслы, когда началась весна,
          когда начали пахать, каков был урожай хлеба, какие цены были
          на туземный товар и прочее, и прочее. По-зырянски такая
          планочка, исчерченная разнообразными значками, называется
          «пас». Еще в 1928 году в журнале «Коми му» краевед Дмитрий
          Борисов отмечал, что «пасы и в настоящее время в глухих
          деревнях, а также среди охотников играют далеко не последнюю
          роль».<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Но параллельно существовала и вторая
          письменность — хорошо развитое буквенное письмо,
          заимствованное у южных соседей. Даже слово «буква» по-коми не
          «пас», а «шыпас» (то есть пас, обозначающий звук «шы»). Только
          на основе общей письменности могли свободно переписываться с
          булгарским царем предки коми народа.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">О различии двух видов письменности в XIX веке
          писал Георгий Лыткин: «Зырянские пасы никогда не имели
          значения букв, ими нельзя передать того, что передавали
          египетские иероглифы. Между пасами и стефановскими буквами
          нельзя делать никаких сближений».<br>
          Откуда есть пошла коми письменность?</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">А пошла она из Ирана. Много веков назад
          иранские купцы, как и «лица кавказской национальности»
          сегодня, нисколько не смущаясь расстояниями, вели на север
          свои караваны с серебром, закупая и вывозя на юг «мягкое
          золото» — закамские меха. Везли через Хазарию и Булгарию свои
          товары, а с ними — и свои слова, вошедшие в коми язык: «зарни»
          («золото»), «амысь» («плуг»), «нянь» («хлеб»), «\ксы»
          («господин»), «пурт» («нож»), «сур» («пиво») и т.д. Одним из
          иранских слов, прижившихся в коми языке, стало «неб\г» -
          «книга». В книгах и документах, попадавших на север, были
          буквы, которые стали основой первой коми письменности. Часто
          на север попадали также иранские сасанидские монеты и
          серебряные блюда и чаши, покрытые «неизвестными
          среднеазийскими письменами», — еще один источник новых букв.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">«Территория между Камой, Вычегдой и Печорой,
          занятая коми, с давних пор находилась в орбите оживленной
          торговли Запада с Востоком. Древняя Пермия была насквозь
          пронизана нитями торговли, связывающей вычегодские дебри с
          отдаленнейшими концами Европы и Азии. Сюда проникали изделия
          Ирана, монеты Мавераннегра и Британии, серебряные блюда из
          Греции, чаши из Киликии. Здесь и сейчас нередки находки монет,
          серебряных и золотых вещей восточного и средиземноморского
          происхождения», — пишет в «Очерках истории народа коми-зырян»
          Николай Ульянов.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Возможность существования в древней Перми
          письменности иранского происхождения допускает ряд ученых, в
          том числе такие известные лингвисты, как Гюнтер Стипа и Адольф
          Туркин. А.Туркин считал, что подобная письменность
          существовала и в Булгарии, но пропала после принятия этой
          страной ислама. Тогда все булгарские книги, которые не были
          написаны на арабском языке, были уничтожены. Финский лингвист
          Гюнтер Стипа в начале 60-х годов прошлого века опубликовал две
          статьи о древнем коми языке. Он искал корни древней коми
          письменности в иранском, арамейском, старогрузинском и
          староармянском алфавитах. Г.Стипа пишет, что не только форму
          букв, но и названия древнекоми звуков зыряне позаимствовали у
          какого-то северно-иранского алфавита, ставшего также основой
          азбуки многих кавказских народов.</font><br>

      <p><font size="+1">Слово «пас» обозначает «знак», «тамга»,
          «клеймо». Пасы использовались как обереги и в качестве знака
          родовой собственности. Они ставились на предметах быта,
          например, на прялках, на сельскохозяйственном и охотничьем
          инвентаре, на рыболовецких снастях. Отмечали пасами и границы
          лесных угодий.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Пасы послужили основой для формирования коми
          орнамента. Древние зырянские знаки собственности легли в
          основу древнепермской азбуки — АНБУР, составленной Стефаном
          Пермским в 1372 г.</font></p>

          вытеснены инициалами и личными подписями, но в повседневном

          традиция выражена на территории современных Корткеросского,

      <p>it means combined by Stephan, arranged. The signs existed
        before he only put them in christian order. I wonder what their
        other order could be, could there be an order? 111 could be
        syllabary (21 consonants and 5 vowels) – so syllabaries preceded
        alphabet? they're more bulky, none would want to reform it from
        alphabet to syllables. But syllables derive from hieroglyphs.
        Egyptian evolved from Chinese, because chinese writings don't
        have phonetic part. Phonetic transliteration is a step towards
        alphabetic writing system, and it appeared in Egypt. And
        egyptians used syllables, even more bulky syllables than
        abudigas have, ankh as a syllable. or is it hieroglyph? But this
        hieroglyph doesn't need phonetic part, so it's closer to
        Chinese, but when I consulted historic sources, I see that
        official science has it the other way around: Egyptian
        hieroglyphs existed at least centuries before Chinese were
        concieved: official version (or the main myth) is that chinese
        hieroglyphs were invented by Cangjie, probably that's why
        chinese hieroglyphs are named Kanji in Japanese. And this clerk
        lived c. 2650 BCE when Egyptian hieroglyphs are registered on
        this artefact dated back to 31st century BC and it does have
        egyptian hieroglyphs, and the ones which later were used for
        denoting syllables phonetically. It doesn't meant they're in
        this function here, but probably yep.<br>

      <p>But once again I can ignore official misconceptions due to what
        structure development indicates, because I just found that
        chinese tradition is more ancient than egyptian, because in
        egypt symbols on Gerzean pottery from c. 4000 BC didn't have
        much to do with hieroglyphs, at least among what I saw, and in
        china there were found Jiahu symbols dated to 6600–6200 BCE
        which correspond chinese hieroglyphs by their <img alt=""

        That famous oracle bone probably was just using a similar &amp;

          Neolithic graves excavated at Jiahu, Henan province, northern

          According to some archaeologists, the symbols carved on the
          shells had similarities to the late 2nd millennium BCE oracle
          bone script.[4] Others have dismissed this claim as

            excavated Neolithic lakeside settlement in Greece.
            Archaeological research provided evidence that the site was
            continuously used from the Early Neolithic (~6000 BC) to the
            Late Chalcolithic period (~1200 BC, Mycenaean period).
            During several archaeological campaigns, a portion of the
            settlement has been excavated that enabled a sufficient
            understanding of the architectural layout of homes, the
            building materials, and the organization of space, while the
            finds (fragments of pottery, stone and bone tools,
            anthropomorphic and zoomorphic clay figurines, miniature
            representations of objects also on clay, animal and fish
            bones, charred cereal grains, and other fruits) provided
            information on the everyday lives of the Neolithic
            inhabitants. A series of charcoal and wood samples,
            originating mostly from the Middle and Late Neolithic layers
            of the site, were radiocarbon dated and their dates range
            from ~5470 to 4850 BC. The most unexpected of the finds, a
            wooden tablet from the lake bearing engraved symbols, was
            14C dated to 5260 ± 40 BC. In addition, clay tablets and
            pottery vessels engraved with similar symbols were also
            unearthed from layers dated to the same period. If this
            proves to be a primary source of written communication, the
            history of writing should be reconsidered and Neolithic
            societies should not be considered “societies without

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, here's the spikelets and bodies of
      animals, and it means that's the writings I wanted to compare to
      that misterious chinese writing system:<br>

      &nbsp;<font size="+1">One hundred and thirteen pieces of carved
        signs were unearthed, dividing into 22 kinds. The carved signs
        mainly used for keeping records and they carried the nature of
        written language. They are embryonic form of Chinese
        character.Archaeologists believe that early writings did exist
        in Banpo. Engraved symbols could be classified into 27</font> <font

        of writing, even earlier than oracles of Shang Dynasty.</font><br>
      <br>
      I haven't found where the left collection came from, but the signs
      on smithereens look suspiciously european.<br>
      And this bowl with supposedly linear A look suspiciously chinese:<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where is the original artefact I wonder,&nbsp;<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why do they always feed me

      &nbsp;and what sign about the <span class="Deva" lang="hi">ऊ</span>
      sign I don't see on other linearA's but 3 times on this one?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ah, no, I can see something similar on the
      other two..<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a strong intention to edid all the
      writing system I don't know much about out of this book, but I
      decided to leave them. First, because I'm going to edit this book
      as you read it, so if you want a better version return in a couple
      of years. Second, because they said "whoever evades risk of being
      rediculous, doesn't have a chance of becoming great" who said? I
      didn't manage to find this quote; was it inspirobot?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly I found that jar. But why almost
      nobody else in the field uses this image!<br>

        I didn't research it, so just a copy-paste:<br>

      <p><font size="+1">As the Banpo symbols were discovered fairly
          early (1954–57)[12] and are relatively numerous (with 22
          different symbols on 113 sherds),[13] these have been the
          focus of the most attention.<br>

          symbols on pottery vessels from Dinggong are thought by some
          scholars to be an early form of writing. Again, this is
          controversial. Symbols of a similar nature have also been

      <p><font size="+1">The Dongba, Tomba or Tompa symbols are a system
          of pictographic glyphs used by the ²dto¹mba (Bon priests) of
          the Naxi people in southern China. In the Naxi language it is
          called ²ss ³dgyu 'wood records' or ²lv ³dgyu 'stone
          records'.[1] "They were developed in approximately the seventh
          century."[2] The glyphs may be used as rebuses for abstract
          words which do not have glyphs. Dongba is largely a mnemonic
          system, and cannot by itself represent the Naxi language;
          different authors may use the same glyphs with different
          meanings, and it may be supplemented with the geba syllabary
          for clarification.</font><br>

          language. It is called ¹Ggo¹baw in Naxi, adapted as Geba, 哥巴,
          in Chinese. Some glyphs resemble the Yi script, and some
          appear to be adaptations of Chinese characters. Geba is only
          used to transcribe mantras, and there are few texts, though it
          is sometimes used to annotate dongba pictographs.</font><br>

      <p>Where I found it it was told:<br>
      </p>
      <p>百家姓图腾<br>
        所谓图腾，是产生在母氏族社会时期。当时的人们无力对抗自然的严酷考验，而把某种动物、植物或非生物等当作自己的亲属、祖先或保
        护神，相信他们有一种超自然力，会保护自己，还可以获得他们的力量与技能。因此，把图腾当作崇拜的对象，并以图腾名称作为族群名
        称，用同一图腾来统一族群的成员。为了子孙与其他族群区隔，便以图腾做为家族的微章，甚至以图腾为姓氏，并把图腾绘制、调刻在建
        筑或器物上，做为辨识族群的记号。</p>
      <p>Which google translated as:<br>
      </p>
      <p>Hundred family name totems.</p>
      <p>The so-called totem is produced during the period of the mother
        clan society. People at that time could not cope with the harsh
        test of nature, and regarded certain animals, plants or
        non-livings as their relatives, ancestors or protectors. I
        believe that they have a supernatural power that will protect
        themselves and gain their strength and skill. Therefore, the
        totem is regarded as the object of worship, and the name of the
        totem is used as the name of the group, and the same totem is
        used to unify the members of the group. In order to distinguish
        the descendants from other ethnic groups, the totem is used as
        the family's micro-chapter, and even the totem is used as the
        surname, and the totem is drawn and engraved on the building or
        artifact as a symbol for identifying the ethnic group.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This field relates to what they say about Komi writings. Tamga
        signs and stuff. Doesn't this word remind Dongba (aka Tomba) to
        you? It probably does. But is it the same concept, the same
        word? Probably not, but how can we reject a posibility of this
        completely, I don't think we should.<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="img/464.png" alt="" height="289"

        <br>
      </div>
      <p>And what is this? I think it shows that chinese characters and
        these geba or tomga could if not originate from one another,
        whether influence each other or be influenced by some other
        cultural phenomena.<br>
      </p>
      <p>These Geba &amp; Tomba are really hard to find. I have some
        bilingua with chinese. I still cannot find the dictionary of any
        of them in image, I will search for dictionary not in image, but
        in other formats.. but instead I just googled for it in chinese,
        and when I found few images, I reverse-searched to find some
        more. I recommend you reverse-search images which caught your
        interest. But seriously, how dare I be using other people's
        images and in such plethora!? Internets changed the world. It
        will be silly and humiliating to stick to old rules, I feel
        obliged to find the new rules, I belive everybody will profit
        from this new attitude and manner of behaviour: I get free
        images and they get free promotion. Was it so hard to figure it
        out before they destroyed their own music industry trying to
        fight with pirates! And they did so on the very apex of music
        industry! They didn't know of dematerialization as business
        model. Probably it wasn't invented then yet.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Me, I'm just collecting images I wanna research later, maybe
        next time I update I will be knowing something new about them.
        Now I only can predict that they will find writing system of New
        Zealand when they discover that wall of the ancients and many
        more settlements. I've travelled all the world and I found some
        basic elements (three vowels, three mothers, three dice, etc)
        but I haven't seen the basic structures laying in plain sight.
        Or will I discover it from what I already know and I will be
        ashamed of myself not seeing it earlier so I don't blame humans
        unable to see what I've already discovered. If you are enjoying
        this book, you're a special kind of people, the true one, one of
        those who justify existence of the specie. Not empowered animal,
        but actually the maker of another level to this life. You take
        large tasks 'cause you'll probably succeed. Look what I've taken
        and I deliver, another projects of mine also move on. Get
        motivated, I know that only few percents of people understand
        what I'm talking of, few percents of the speaking the language,
        and maybe 1% gets it right.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Or maybe in this comics of Naxi I will meet the essence of
        chinese characters and the very mythical labial and lingual,
        because I expect much of chinesse: they conservated words on the
        most ancient level, when each word was a syllable (each chinese
        hieroglyph, even when dyphthong, is just one syllable) egyptian
        hieroglyphs don't deliver like this. And egyptian hieroglyphs
        have syllabic and alphabetic structures invented already,
        chinese don't. And now I found Jiahu symbols looking like
        chinese hieroglyphics in China. <font color="#C0C0C0">Of course
          theoretically they could be fake (even though they were
          accepted but no matter how hated, still respected scientific
          community (they can ignore the true thing, I still doubt they
          would embrace a forgery)</font> So I expect much more
        artefacts from the chinese region and NZ.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Back to normal languages, greek ἕνωσις has ε sounding pretty
        much like arabic ه (arabic ه stands at the position of ε) – my
        teacher of Greek told me that those '` at the top of ε – at
        least one of them is Ͱ, a half of H, even though H is taught to
        be vowel. But here's what I found:<br>

        and as a vowel (line 3: "Πρόκλης")</font><br>

        First of all what bugs me the most about it is san looking too
        much like mu. Of course we have I &amp; l looking even more
        alike, but I still don't think it's an accident, double l is
        short I in Mallorca and papillon. So what's the reason between M
        &amp; S being so much similar. <font color="#CCCCCC">I'm pretty
          sure I recently saw somewhere else M being like S, but I
          forgot of archaic greek to compare.</font><br>

      <p>The other thing is some iotas looking like some sigmas. It's s
        again, and I reflects M in k-symmetry. Though I'm not sure it

        them, when they will be put into a curiousities chests. I doubt
        I can trust these tables completely, because look at sampi — I
        was taught that this letter was not used as s, but it was there
        for counting, then why others don't have them, if to count with
        alphabet you have to have 27 letters, and where's Ionic digamma,
        if it was there when sampi was there. Then there'd be 27, and
        what about others? did they use some numbering system alike to
        Roman &amp; Etruscan? Give us the etruscan numbers:<br>

      <p>I realize here I don't have much to tell about hungarian runes.
        They look relative to normanic runes more than to greek even
        though their first letter A reminds mediteranean A almost
        completely, being in between of A &amp; a.&nbsp; I was looking
        for forms of letter a without that upper swash, and found a
        cursive form where a looks like g or q. I remeber O reflecting G
        and e reflecting q in k-symmetry. I will research hungarian
        hunes and will return to this fascinatingly interesting topic.</p>
      <p>But for now let me count all the similarities I see: first I
        though ly is an unique letter, but I found similar sign for also
        lingual дж or ж in perm alphabet. But wow! Hungarian runes also
        have even more similar to permic ж both graphically and
        phonetically: see z &amp; dz on the image below. and only z on
        other images around.<br>

      <p>SPQR — just as AEIOU has nationalistic backronym, this one
        could also be taken wrong. It could be an appept to rearrange
        the fourth line (just as they did with the third in prehistoric
        period and sometimes with the second one in historic) or it
        tells that s is an invariant of o: σ (minuscle s in modern greek
        and there's something interesting about minuscle: they teach
        that it appeared only in medieval times, but them they usually
        omit mentioning roman cursive — and it contains some ancient
        correlations: bd pq or did it appear later by our
        rationalization of the script. Could we be conciously (then
        conspiring) or unconciously (then neurophysiologists must
        research it) crystallizing structures in alphabets?: latin
        alphabet has the velar column, and not any other does too.
        neither phoenician nor ugaritic have velar column, and though
        ugaritic is more ancient than phoenician, and though it follows
        those structures not worse than phoenician — or should I say
        hebrew? let's speak in modern terms, they use the same alphabet
        only graphemes are different, but we don't look at forms of
        letters now, we speak of the bigger structure. Why do I say
        "we"? They teach us to use we instead of I in scientific works.
        Also Voltaire said: "You must have Devil in you to succeed in
        any of arts" )<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What writing system I omitted? Cunieform has
        many variants, and I only looked at the alphabetic one. But as
        soon it's sometimes not simple to see straight border between

            have different feel of harmony, as their tastes in other

        egyptian syllables are not seen as syllabary, they were just

      <p>The following is a list of <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs"
          title="Egyptian hieroglyphs">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a> with
        triconsonantal phonetic value. <font color="#CCCCCC">see, they
          even here use this "consonantal alphabet" false concept. I was
          asked yesterday "why are they insisting on this idea if it's
          wrong?" — I could only say "they don't even make real effort
          to rationalize, they just repeat it as parrots". But only part
          of modern linguistic ideas are wrong, this decyphering of
          egyptian writing system could be actually accurate. At least
          they figured out ugaritic alphabet right, according to the
          fact that it's abecedary follows both axial and lineal
          structures not worse that alphabets that are currently in use,
          so you don't have to decypher them. Biliteral was not named
          biconsonant after all, so there's still hope.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this biliteral &amp; triliteral signs make
        egyptian writing system reminds rebus. with signs deriving from
        some ideograms, the same way we use objects to encode phonetic
        values of some completely other word. And ideograms are used not
        for completely other, but for the same words. and there're like
        4 times more of them than of these phonetic signs, but we don't
        work with them yet, for we compare only phonetic writing systems
        for now on. Maybe one day I will put together egyptian, chinese
        &amp; mayan hieroglyphics, but this book also has its limits, so
        for now it doesn't take you there, but you're free to try it. I
        can only see that.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what we figured out here is that
        paleohispanic (iberian) writing systems do not derive neither
        from cuneiform we know of nor from egyptian hieroglyphics.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of cuneiforms, and to close this
        topic for awhile, here's the mother cuneiform, the sumerian
        cuneiform, just few signs out of over a thousand of them:<br>
        <img src="img/su_signs.gif" alt="" height="500" align="left"

        writing from around &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3000

      <p>Modern dogma tells that it derived from archaic greek, <font
          color="#CCCCCC">but it all comes from Herodotus and Greatsy
          Jewish Culture trying to shove their narrative of being the
          most ancient nation on the planet, which would be flattering
          in the case of their myths, when people come from god and keep
          on degrading ever since. Is it one of the reasons why they
          promote degeneracy and try to undermine civilization? Because
          this stand cannot be flattering in the world where we all come
          from apes, and their savage traditions show it: sex with
          minors may have its advantages (people are motivated to create
          families instead of learning how to masturbate watching the
          most degerate form of debauchery) But in the same sense
          cannibalism used to solve africa's hunger problem, but this
          tradition is still degenerate nevertheless.</font> But
        writings in Lydian are reported to exist in the layers of 5th
        century BCE, and coins with Lydian on them are reported to be
        dated back to 8th century BCE — exactly when Greek is believed
        to acquire its alphabet. But then again Lydian IS a dialect of
        greek. Is it not? No, it is not. Lydians adopted Greek in the
        1st century BC, and before that they spoke some indo-european
        but still a different language.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the given table of Lydian is correct, it
        doesn't arrange into the axyal structure, which can be an
        evidence that it is not. But I still haven't seen Lydian
        abecedary as a genuine artifact, so let's move on.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I brought Lydian here to compare several
      symbols of lydian to iberian. e is the same and in southeastern
      iberian pe/be is similar, and vav is in the second row, the e-row.
      ke is the same as in lydian. and again on the south, both south
      this time.<br>

      Notice that nonsyllabary letters are likely borrowed from
      neighbouring cultures: L is like in normanic runes, n is like in
      phoenician, R is like q which is reversed p as R is in greek. s is
      like ks in greek, s' is like san in archaic greek and in.. R is
      exactly q in phoenician (phoenician goes from right to left)<br>
      <br>
      Northeastern iberian M (those tables tell that only northeasterns
      had M among iberians, and that they had two of them) looks exactly
      like ᛠ, anglo-saxon rune for ea. other form of it is V, which
      makes more sense, because both are labial, but the table above
      tells that in iberian scripts M looked like y Y T and something
      like ᛈ which is p in anglo-saxon &amp; elder. T would explain why
      m is t in russian, but here it's clear, T is what ᛠ looks in
      practice.<br>

      Lydia is in Turkey, both are Mediterranean, but it's all across
      the Mediterranea.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      But then let's compare iberian to hungarian too, because a's are
      the same.<br>
      Hungarian is on the left, on the right I compare them with
      normanic.<br>

      Once again T (this time in form of D) compete with U. U in
      hungarian, D in norman<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;But let's give word to those who think Iberian comes from
      Greek or Phoenician:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="img/iberian_comparison.gif" alt="" height="314"
        align="left" width="580"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, it indeed has many
      similarities, but once again I claim that development happened
      otherwise, from Spain to Greece, simply because who would need to
      take an elegant alphabet system and to turn it into a clumsy
      syllabary. As an engineer I say it didn't happen. But they're
      correct that some signs of those writing systems are very similar,
      but that could be case of Russain &amp; English alphabets, with
      Greek standing between them, so I say "dig deeper, colleagues".<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But looking for writing systems that combine
      alphabetic &amp; syllabary features, I <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-syllabary">found</a>
      that the closest to Iberian <font color="#C0C0C0">(of all I know)</font>
      is Old-Persian cuneiform:<br>

      Though it has only 3 vowels, which makes us want to compare it to
      south-eastern syllabaries, It is really close to Iberian in regard
      to only k,g, t,d, m,v + j, n, r being syllabary, the rest are to
      act as letters of so called "consonant alphabets" do <font
        color="#C0C0C0">(I explained before why I consider this term
        false, but it still exists, so I use it)</font> and though
      b&amp;p don't differ into syllables, as Iberians have them, two
      other labial letters take this role. It could indicate that the
      systems are not directly related, or it can be due to the
      dialectic differences in pronunciations.<br>
      <br>
      Their graphic differences shouldn't bother us too much, because
      georgian alphabet is graphically very unique, but structurally it
      shows following the same structures.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why I focus on Iberian writings:<br>
      1. five vowels and syllabary of 3 consonants remind alphabetic
      structure of vowels, labials, velars, coronal:<br>

      I see more common between iberian &amp; normanic runes than
      between iberian and greek. I see here the birth of alphabet from
      the foam of syllabary. It also explains why latin alphabet has so
      many k's (c, k, q, and g is born from c, and x could be ks)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I notice u in the northeast iberian being the
      same sign as pi/bi in southern ones, so I identify that pi/bi as
      V. and it's another case of V standing for T (that very sign is T
      in normanic runes) — the others are Uracil instead of Thymine and
      some others I don't remember right now. V is final instead of T
      sometimes. and there were more, I met it in ogham before, though
      now I began to read it and gosh how difficult I write, it's hard
      for me myself to understand what I wanted to say.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Northeastern iberian began to distinguish
      between voiced and voiceless, but it does it the way Normanic
      runes on the alphabetic stone from Bornholm do (runes used dots,
      Northeastern iberian brings udditional strokes, but if you
      research normanic runes, you'll see those dot's are sometimes
      strokes (because ᛂ=ᛅ=ᛄ=ᛡ=ᛆ)<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arrange
      these images geographically: NorthEast is at TopRight,<br>
      SouthWest is at BottomLeft, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      SouthEast is at BottomRight.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see that you can divide them in South
      of Spain &amp; North of Spain.<br>
      North of Spain is influenced by AngloSaxons &amp; Normans.<br>
      South of Spain is influenced by Greeks &amp; maybe Phoenicians
      too.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Spanish writing system is more ancient than
      they all.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Spanish single letters are of 4 vowels
      (normans had 4 rows, hebrew (phoenicians) have 4 rows) but the
      Spanish vocalism was already of 5 vowels.<br>
      And though Old Persian has only 3 vowels, and thus are more
      primitive, Old Spain' consonants show three groups of syllables,
      not letters, syllables, and in this closer to Chinese
      hieroglyphics. I don't know much about it, but it seems they kept
      that anciently invented structure in whole (even though they made
      some reforms concerning quantity of the ready pictures. I wonder
      if masters may draw new hieroglyphs comprehensible to other
      chinese masters, for they see picture in iit.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So chances are the motherland of alphabets is
      between Persia and Spain. Whenever I find the structure of 3
      vowels &amp; 3(*3) syllables. So I'm looking for a writing system
      of 12 signs. I heard of such, even though they were using latin
      alphabet for it, There can be an ancient writing system. If not in
      artifacts, in the structure of the set itself. so I start digging:<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See the pattern here? Also 3 main groups of
          consonants: and they're the same as in Iberian: PTK (BDG)<br>
          But 5 vowels, do they really destinguish i from e &amp; o from
          u? I don't know the language, just leave this lead for some
          reader who just happen to know this, to pick it up where I

                  C G Х<br>
                  D Ш Z, theorize I of what the first alphabet made of
                  those Iberian syllabary<br>
                  U &amp; V are historically the same letter. P is to
                  much like B (Iberians didn't distinguish them) and the
                  Labial I left behind is M. The very important letter.<br>
                  So the question is if it's instead of F or V, but M is
                  named the central letter, and it's always in the I-row
                  and F after U is traditionally in greek and those who
                  took of there.<br>

                  B M F<br>

                  D Ш Z<br>
                  I think I took the most diverse form of the letters we
                  know: S is too much of C (Çç) and K and Q sound
                  exactly like C can. It even can be [v] in russian -го
                  suffix.<br>
                  D Sh Z also sound the most diverse in their group of
                  coronals.<br>
                  Ш (Sh) is samekh by its position. Z being final is
                  weird, because it was in the second row in greek, and
                  is believed to appear in latin from there, but we have
                  a bigger problem:<br>
                  When I had F in the second column, it was IFGШ which
                  is simlar to EFGH,<br>
                  but when I put M there, it's not the second like, but
                  the third.<br>
                  IMK(LN)Sh — X [ks] Ξ (ξ) is in greek. But only semitic
                  languages support this tradition.<br>
                  Why am I giving direct advice to those who make
                  forgery? Ah I change the future revealing the past.
                  Some people will try to make forgeries based on this

                  (because almost nobody can make direct measurements of

                              it was 3 rows &amp; 3 columns in the first
                              alphabet. Now it's time to show another
                              3*3 I found in digits:<br>

                              crystallized into some kind of structure,

          But let's apply this 3*3 to the variant of alphabet I
          mentioned before I came to this subject:<br>
          ABC<br>
          IMK<br>
          UFX<br>
          I chose C instead of D to represent ᚦ because abc is what the
          alphabet is called, because apes can't pronounce coronal
          sounds (and those who taught one to say "na" should have
          figured it out before they began that experiment) and what I
          didn't expect is X as the final letter, which happened, when
          it stood for T, so it's what it would look like if it was
          3vowels, B, T. But though this alphabet follows lineal
          structure perfectly, it fits axial structure so poorly, that a
          fir of 3 triangles would be the best way to look at it.<br>
          <br>
        </font></font> And here I found what kind of supports my
      hypothesis, a form of Iberian with just 3 vowels in case of T-<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if we draw this trend further, 3*3 was
          2*2. And we have 2*2 in English:<br>

        ᛒ is similar to ᛉ because both are two cunei at a staff.Imagine
        how ancient it is if they wrote on staffs (magic sticks) now I
        have to compare runes to cuneiform.<img src="img/030.png" alt=""
          height="396" align="left" width="550"></p>
      <p><img src="img/ugaritic.png" alt="" height="431" align="right"

      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B in both runic &amp; ugaritic represent
        double D. So it does in roman majuscule, in roman minuscle it's
        reflecting each-other instead, which wouldn't make much sense in
        boustrophedon.<br>
      </p>
      <p><img src="img/244.png" alt="" height="238" align="left"
          width="360">And in roman cursive they both look the same way,
        so now the question is when did <font size="+3">𓃀</font> begin
        to watch the end of the line? You watch where you came from but
        you walk towards the exit as you write? as those swastikas I
        spoke above? They are among letters sometimes. And as we touched
        this topic, I can add that though both swastikas are present in
        unicode, but only clockwise fish ࿊ ࿋ ࿌ are present there, it may
        make sense because unicode symbols are lobbied by communities
        who have a huge deal in using those symbols, so they may know
        something I haven't discovered yet.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And luckily the table above shows when did this transition of <font
          size="+3">𓃀</font> to the end of the line happened, literally
        in cursiva nueva!<br>
        Here I wanted to combine these two topics of swastikas &amp; of
        boots of b, using the symbol used on the flag of isle of man.
        And I was searching for it in new unicode signs, and I noticed
        coloured icons are among them, but also 🟇🟈🟍🟑🟔 notice that
        only 4 pointed star has both forms, others rotate clockwise if
        we count pressure of the light. <img src="img/1351497681_1.jpg"
          alt="" height="377" align="right" width="505">But if those
        stars are windmill toys they would be otherwise, but these stars
        are not. But swasticas could be, lucky swastikas rotates
        clockwise:<br>
      </p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>That unicode chart is very valuable source for grammatology (I
        reclaim this term out of the postmodernist claws, this terms
        belong into linguistics.<br>
      </p>
      <p>🜄 is ALCHEMICAL SYMBOL FOR WATER<br>
      </p>
      <p>🜅 is ALCHEMICAL SYMBOL FOR AQUAFORTIS<br>

      <p>🜆 and 🜇 are ALCHEMICAL SYMBOLS FOR AQUA REGIA<br>

        🁚 🂋very convenient, they have unicode for all domino, it will
        be very convenient when we speak about them in context of their
        symilarity to dice and empty slots of 🁣🀱 which were present in
        falling stones of Bureus, they even have their backs.<br>
        Simple european cards &amp; mahjong &amp; tetragrams, greek
        musical notation symbols I was speaking of above:<br>
        𝈝𝈞𝈟𝈠𝈡𝈢𝈣𝈤𝈥𝈦𝈧𝈨𝈩𝈪𝈫𝈬𝈭𝈮𝈯𝈰𝈱𝈲𝈳𝈴𝈵𝈶𝈷𝈸𝈹𝈺𝈻𝈼𝈽𝈾𝈿𝉀𝉁









































        and greek musical lemma 𝉅<br>
        and greek vocal notation symbols:
        𝈀𝈁𝈂𝈃𝈄𝈅𝈆𝈇𝈈𝈉𝈊𝈋𝈌𝈍𝈎𝈏𝈐𝈑𝈒𝈓𝈔𝈕𝈖𝈗𝈘𝈙𝈚𝈛𝈜<br>
        There're also byzantine musical symbols, which have names
        similar to their forms, which can be a source of knowledge on
        history of alphabet:<br>
      </p>
      <p>it begins with some long list of unremarcable (only so tiny)
        sings (not listed here) and suddenly in becomes more alphabetic:<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL SIMANSIS ARSEOS TETRASIMOU 𝃥<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL DIGRAMMA GG 𝃦<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL DIFTOGGOS OU 𝃧<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL STIGMA 𝃨<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL ARKTIKO PA 𝃩<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL ARKTIKO VOU 𝃪</p>
      <p>and suddenly it goes directly alphabetic (though probably
        others are only to arrange in the same order, I don't know who
        made this unicode list and how competently did (s)he arrange
        them into order<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL ARKTIKO GA 𝃫<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL ARKTIKO DI 𝃬<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL ARKTIKO KE 𝃭<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL ARKTIKO ZO 𝃮<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL ARKTIKO NI 𝃯<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL KENTIMATA NEO MESO 𝃰<br>
        and on it goes the same not alphabetic manner. but let's collect
        all the alphabetic bysantine musical signs and will arrange them
        into greek order:<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL SIMANSIS THESEOS TETRASIMOU 𝃡<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL SIMANSIS THESEOS TRISIMOU 𝃠<br>
        It's unbearable, why are they so small! I will return to this
        topic some day, but from some other angle.<br>
        But it's the first time we saw digamma, which for some reason is
        digramma:<br>

          horizontal lines each of which may be broken or unbroken), the
          <i>Taixuanjing</i> employs 81 ternary tetragrams (sequences of
          four lines, each of which may be unbroken, broken once, or
          broken twice). Like the <i>I Ching</i> it may be consulted as
          an oracle by casting yarrow stalks or a six-faced die to
          generate numbers which define the lines of a tetragram, which
          can then be looked up in the text.<sup class="noprint

      <p><font size="+1">In the canonical <i>I Ching</i>, the hexagrams
          are arranged in an order dubbed the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_sequence"
            title="King Wen sequence">King Wen sequence</a> after King
          Wen of Zhou, who founded the Zhou dynasty and supposedly
          reformed the method of interpretation. The sequence generally
          pairs hexagrams with their upside-down equivalents, although
          in eight cases hexagrams are paired with their inversion.<sup
            id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESmith200837_54-0" class="reference"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmith200837-54">[50]</a></sup>
          Another order, found at <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawangdui"
            title="Mawangdui">Mawangdui</a> in 1973, arranges the
          hexagrams into eight groups sharing the same upper trigram.
          But the oldest known manuscript, found in 1987 and now held by
          the Shanghai Library, was almost certainly arranged in the
          King Wen sequence, and it has even been proposed that a
          pottery paddle from the Western Zhou period contains four
          hexagrams in the King Wen sequence.<sup
            id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEShaughnessy201452–3,_16-7_55-0"

          Whichever of these arrangements is older, it is not evident
          that the order of the hexagrams was of interest to the
          original authors of the <i>Zhou yi</i>. The assignment of
          numbers, binary or decimal, to specific hexagrams is a modern
          invention.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERutt1996114–8_56-0"

      <p>I am a collector, I collect marvelous items, I don't know if
        we'll need this image in this book, but here it is anyway.<br>
      </p>
      <p>------------------<br>
      </p>
      <p>Now just to keep on going, I'll copy-pase some more interesting
        byzantine musical symbols:<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL THITA 𝀔<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL OLIGON ARCHAION 𝀕<br>
        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL GORGON ARCHAION 𝀖<br>

        BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL OXEIAI ARCHAION 𝀠</p>
      <p><br>
        They even have phaistos disc signs:<br>
𐇐𐇑𐇒𐇓𐇔𐇕𐇖𐇗𐇘𐇙𐇚𐇛𐇜𐇝𐇞𐇟𐇠𐇡𐇢𐇣𐇤𐇥𐇦𐇧𐇨𐇩𐇪𐇫𐇬𐇭𐇮𐇯𐇰𐇱𐇲𐇳𐇴𐇵𐇶𐇷𐇸𐇹𐇺𐇻𐇼<br>
        which is not even necessarily genuine:<br>
https://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/07/why-not-test-the-phaistos-disc/<br>
      </p>
      <p>and the unicode vault goes on, I've no wish to paste it all
        here,<br>
        you can wander it yourselves:<br>
        https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/So/list.htm<br>
      </p>
      <p>I will collect some more of what catches my attention:<br>
        GREEK SYMBOL TAU RHO 𐆠<br>
        CHI RHO ☧<br>
        PENTAGRAM ⛤<br>
        RIGHT-HANDED INTERLACED PENTAGRAM ⛥<br>
        LEFT-HANDED INTERLACED PENTAGRAM ⛦<br>
        INVERTED PENTAGRAM ⛧<br>
        I can only guess what is the difference between those three
        pentagrams, but they all have different unicode: U+26E4, U+26E5,
        U+26E6<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It weirdly relates to this work, because I
        was speaking of three mothers, three fates, three 6s <font
          color="#CCCCCC">(о трёх полах? серьёзо? some of people are in
          the middle)</font>&nbsp;<br>
        Doesn't star stand for Venus (then the U+26E7 is the initial
        form?)<br>
        Aren't 3 6s UVW (all stand for venus) notice, that <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z5aPaDwAkU">-us is a
          male suffix</a>. I was told in hebrew grammar some gender
        twist took place in the past. It could be a part of that reform.
        together with twist of м &amp; ж.<br>
        Ain't ⛤⛥⛦ stand for 666? but they have 5 ends! and that's how
        many letters per Bureus die. <font color="#CCCCCC">oh how
          weirdly irresponsible are the previous two words! (if we
          believe in magic, but it hardly affects dead)</font><br>
        What if 666 is initially 555? What if this unicode chart has
        nothing to do with reality, but was some voluntaristic act.
        Those right-hand &amp; left-hand relates pentagrams to
        swastikas, the biggest star is sun. But I never saw sun as ⛧, I
        only saw it as one of these stars: 🟇🟈🟍🟑🟔 (I have to make an
        experiment, but it's night)<br>
        🟍🟍🟍 could be 666, and I saw this sign in some p!nk's video
        and somewhere else. and Jewsus named jews sinagogue of Satan and
        that their father is Devil and Jewish god in bible kills and
        does all sorts of wicked things &amp; commands. And according to
        esoteric part of christianity world is in the hands of Satan
        until the second coming. and you know jews do rule the world. So
        now I need to talk to jews, I used to learn from them hebrew,
        secular jews are quite fine, but religious jews say they made
        communism to russians and make a lot of trouble in the world
        before that and today. But it was religious jews who were
        shocked by my appearance when I tried to ask questions. I think
        they're all retarded one way or another. Genetic therapies come,
        russians are also retarded in some other way.<br>
        I know this stuff is not scientific enough, but here I only
        guess, this part of the book will be rewritten.<br>
        <font color="#cccccc">(and <a href="continuation.html">here</a>
          is the following part, which is even more something between
          good edit and mere draft)</font><br>
