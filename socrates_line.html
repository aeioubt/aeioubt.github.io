            selfpreservance. a better way is to hide away under the
            surface of the planet, learning how to measure pressure
            around and how to move around under the ground, building
            structures there if needed, but let those structures be
            transportable, so that if somebody hears you and starts
            digging, you just move under his house to know him better,
            and if he's a good fellow, you behave as a decent
            intraterrestrial, a&nbsp; decent fellow would never dig
            under someone else's construction,. especially becausse
            those are supposed to stand on solid rock, so I'd move it
            away not to care of what smart monkeys on the surface are
            doing. I'd say other intelligent entities too, but I'm not
            sure we'll allow tigers to be smart. only if tiger is so
            smart that he understands ethics, not all humans do, btw,
            but would we allow dumb humans to turn into smart tigers?

            takes them lots of funds to build it, so wait, don't die of
            something stupid. writing such books I take my chances, I
            also build my chances offering EVERYBODY a service, today
            mostly only well thought advice, but imagine when I'm
            all-productive and being able to share because every thecond
            I make what I need and more, if needed, of course I
            shouldn't overproduce, I just should be able to split like

          that's another story<font color="#cccccc"> (and of course
            hardly will somebody care if you play with your food.

          Symposium by Plato could be speaking about blood <font

            could be nothing really)</font> this part of the book is one
          wild assumption on the top of the other, so you should be
          careful with what you put in your head really. But it also
          makes sense of their homosexuality, because male predators
          would be interested in male children, if they don't want to
          turn into chicks. <br>

                                  Меня, конечно, станут обвинять в
                                  антисемитизме, однако, у меня есть три
                                  сильных адвоката. И никто иные, как
                                  три кита сионизма.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Первый мой адвокат - идеолог сионизма
                                  Теодор Герцль, сионист номер один,
                                  который, в своём дневнике писал, что
                                  он считает антисемитизм полезным для
                                  дела еврейского народа.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Второй мой адвокат - Владимир
                                  Жаботинский.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Он, ещё в 1905 году, т. е., во время
                                  первой русской революции писал: Как
                                  довод для сионистской агитации
                                  антисемитизм, особенно возведённый в
                                  принцип, конечно, весьма удобен и
                                  полезен.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Ну и третий мой адвокат - сам
                                  премьер-министр Израиля - Бен Гурион.
                                  Он, в своё время, писал в еврейской
                                  газете Кемпфер в Нью-Йорке:<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Если бы у меня была не только воля, но
                                  и власть, я бы подобрал группу сильных
                                  молодых людей. Задача этих молодых
                                  людей состояла бы в том, чтобы
                                  замаскироваться под неевреев и,
                                  действуя методами грубого
                                  антисемитизма, преследовать евреев
                                  антисемитскими лозунгами.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Я могу поручиться, что результаты, с
                                  точки зрения значительного притока
                                  эмигрантов в Израиль из этих стран,
                                  были бы в 10 раз больше, чем
                                  результаты, которых добились тысячи
                                  эмиссаров чтением бесплодных

                                  сионизма, тесно перекликаются
                                  знаменитые Протоколы сионских
                                  мудрецов, написанные как известно
                                  Ашером Гинзбергом, как политическая
                                  программа Хасидизма (наиболее
                                  изуверская секта иудаизма) для своих
                                  европейских единоверцев - очередная
                                  попытка объединения сил, предпринятая
                                  Ашером, ещё до первого конгресса
                                  сионистов.<br>

                                  В этом историческом документе чётко
                                  говорится, что антисемитизм нужен им
                                  для лучшего управления своими меньшими
                                  братьями.</font></font></font></span></span></font></font></font></font></span></span></font></font><br>

      euphemerous, <br>
      But I'll collect few of those links in the mirrors: <a

      upd4:<br>
      <br>
      here are some other dots, which I dare to connect:<br>
      in 2006 Dave Chapelle walks away from 50 mils.<br>
      when he receives Mark Twain Prize, Jon Stewart introduces him and
      tells that when that went public, he told to himself "Comedy
      Central has 50 millions! I promise to you, Dave, I raised those
      money as my own" <br>
      Dave told that the reason he decided to leave that check behind is
      he was forced to wear drag outfit, and he didn't feel like that
      was something he was supposed to do (those kikes made many
      brothers wear dresses and that humiliation didn't work well for
      those brothers' careers) or something like that, both quotes are
      not verbatim (because Stewart's speech is taken out from open
      access (probably still available at a prepaid channel, but I'll
      wait until it gets back to public domain if it will) and that
      allowed me not to look for exact Chapelle's words) <br>
      in 2007 Tyler the Creator begins his career and when he becomes a
      superstar, he comes out of the closet as a homosexual. That means
      he could be a product of Stewart's genius (even though Tyler is
      genius himself, no doubt about it) who could promise CC to deliver
      whatever effect of their gay propaganda they needed, thus Tyler
      didn't get all the sum, but probably agreed to follow the agenda
      if he's brought to stardom for he would be murdered if he decided
      not to deliver what he promised after the payments.<br>
      even though I woke up today with his genial line "<span
        jsname="YS01Ge">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        <span jsslot=""><span jsname="YS01Ge">And stay focused on the
            women and you get less done</span></span></span>" I was
      going to add this paragraph here yesterday. And I'm not sure it's
      his line, because that thing has many fathers: Songwriters:
      Michael Griffin / Gerard Long / Tyler Okonma (it's fascinating how
      Tyler's name is similar to mine) those other two are Mike G and
      Hodgy and there's also Ace Hashimoto.<br>
      SWAG SWAG SWAG SWAG SWAG SWAG SWAG SWAG SWAG SWAG SWAG SWAG SWAG <font
        color="#ffffff">SWAG</font><br>
      and then another dot I failed to mention: in his appreciating
      speech at that Mark Twain Prize Dave announced (jokingly of
      course) that he's a homosexual to see where he career goes after
      he announced it like that. It was just after he gave a standing
      ovation to that "raised those money as my own" line.<br>
      <br>
      so if swag (even derived from swagger) wasn't gay from the
      beginning, it was successfully hijacked now. and wouldn't it be
      worth more than 50 millions, gush some of them would pay billions
      to make this world a wanting seed, and they probably will. So
      should I embrace my jewness or my bisexuality? Would bisexuality
      even do? Tyler had to come out as straight homosexual,
      "scandinawian girls has those looks but I.. ahouldn't I stop
      botching the direct references?....&nbsp;&nbsp; I should stop
      playing with these hilow vibes, I should wait for immortality and
      to relax into some semianabiotic state in chrysales of our own. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      But be cautious in accepting this rant, because I think it all
      could have grown
      <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
      of my test if I can prove <br>
      anything, so I dared myself to prove that the most oppressed
      group, the homosexuals, secretly rule the world, and I think I
      succeeded (simply because they're the group that's naturally prone
      to secrecies, but the aeon of secrecies have past, so what it's
      gonna be.. I hope something fr<a

      <font color="#cccccc">are as and but that secret code? the words
        only one group used, but unwittingly the rest of societies
        incorporated those conjuctions into their speech?</font><br>

      upd5: <br>
      a guy I like speaks well about Plato, not noticing that no science
      books predating plato survived, not knowing as it seems that Lurye
      wrote that platonic school usurped what they couldn't destroy or
      didn't feel like detroying for whatever reason, maybe because they
      understood it and felt like usurping, destroying all that doesn't
      directly follow from what they have stolen. But what do I know, ai
      will tell for sure if I trip or not, he who diddn't make mistake
      never tried anything new, the opposite narrative, to balance those
      mindfucks out, some of my readers may even find this pill
      therapeutic for their shocked shallow shells:<br>

      Where they laugh of surgeons and Newton's body could be that he
      had some anomaly of development of genitalia, why else would his
      parents neglet him, I never knew all that, so I wander wondering
      too.<br>
      <br>
      And about Newton and free-masons, which it is famous to bash, not
      always clear what for, probably for their secrecies, and probably
      for their attempts to deliver communism whether in french
      revolution or in soviet revolution, but somehow they were more
      benevolent to americans, as if masonry sees USA as a host nation,
      seeing other nations as hostiles. Here's another smart and likable
      man mentions masonry in the context we immediately understand what
      he's speaking of:<br>

      I just understood that it's <br>
      <br>
      What if we remove right side of html we can use it for everything
      with specially invented for that function html code? I heed to
      read html manual, that's it. <br>
      <br>
      just before that: <br>
      <br>
      I use reddit spacing! Leftwingers write books! Read'it write
      books. So we are summoned in two internet platforms/ windg I don't
      liked wing first like I don't want to have anything with them, but
      then I understand that such lexics may be constructive when
      right-wingers solved what was broken after the previous term of
      the left and then if they are wanted by the public (election
      should be transparent as possible (elector who isn't ready to
      defend his opinion being heard are a coward and dosen't deserve to
      vote, or maybe such category would be allowed secret voting, so
      everybody would see that they decide that secret voting is better
      than the why меня таращит, я не хочу записывать то что сегоэня

      I was presented with that html thing so I don't speak about
      something or was I just high beyond my limits so now I try to
      interpret something that wasn't meant to be interpreted.

      Doesn't that Allat look like a cross-dresser to you? A son dressed
      as a woman to protect them, and if such a priest plays in the
      temple, nobody understands how they give births without grooms,
      was it followed or preceded by the taboo on genitalia
      demonstrations? Those priests probably discovered shaving first,
      so they fooled the public. And "her" hat reminds te one of Mitra,

      I thought to search for Allat and Mitra in one sentence, and what
      I found:<br>
      <font size="+1">The Assyrians call Aphrodite Mylitta, the Arabians
        Alilat [Greek spelling: Ἀλιλάτ], and the Persians Mithra.</font><br>
      <font color="#cccccc">and there are more:<font size="+1"><br>
          They believe in no other gods except Dionysus and the Heavenly
          Aphrodite; and they say that they wear their hair as Dionysus
          does his, cutting it round the head and shaving the temples.
          They call Dionysus, Orotalt; and Aphrodite, Alilat. (wiki:
          Herodouts, Histories I:131)</font></font><br>
      I used to think this to be a young woman whose tits are not show<font
        color="#cccccc">n</font>, but I was gay myself to think it's a
      woman, the very same accompanying figures could be at the corners
      of the bas-relief. Snake and scorpio could indicate that this
      cross-dresser used poison on his knife to easily kill a bull, a
      female way of doing murder, so it's a prince grown up by the
      mother and grandmother or a mother and a wife? A family unit,
      women demand families, guys would rather walk гуляли (к ляле)
      гулять (to блять) but that's poetry more than science<br>
      See how at the previous image, the one before the bull, where the
      three "divas" are above a lion, there the c<font color="#cccccc">o</font>entral




      figure (Allat) is larger than other two, and has no tits.<br>

      upd 7: (was the one before, and from vol.7, like what were the
      cahnces) what follows are upd 8 and others, I don't indicate them
      from now on, it's a whole research on it's own. Paradoxically, a
      tribute to Socrates. Who would expect it from me.<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      upd 8<br>
      This disturbing movie can also illustrate how much a bunch of
      faggots can academia be.<br>

      (but then Turing was sterilized which may show that both this is
      not accepted among them or that he's just an example, a scapegoat,
      a victim of conspiracy maybe (but I speak out of no facts, just
      demonsrating that any example can be interpreted by the opposite
      directions)<br>
      <br>
      Though my beef with them is mostly of non-sexual character: I am
      annoyed by most of them bothered by teaching (even when now it's
      possible to automate the process) but then again maybe most of
      them are not actual scientists, but have a career of those without
      actual calling to be one, just because it's an "easy job".<br>
      Then they suppress science, but that can also be interpreted
      otherwise: science only exists within academia, or it mostly does.
      My science is more of some poetry, I don't need equipment, and
      when I do I beg those properly educated and ingraned within the
      system to help me do my thing.<br>

      I spent over a week in custody, and gosh I'm angry. МУСАРА

      И я конечно тоже долбоёб "я-то куда полез, я же читать не умею"
      (драться не умею, какой из меня боец, борец, как тюленя тупорылого
      запакавали, like silly seal, yah. драка с ментами уголовкою

      And then I maybe learnt to shut up. But is it the skill I really
      need? I really need! That's why I singled it out, other lessons
      also were taught, yet to be unlearnt.<br>

      I am seeking for capsule to live in. not to ever get out to the
      monkeys. I found a video where I was at the meeting, I just walked
      and got in their struggle by accident. Whatever. Prisons are
      torture and shoule be abolished for they're obsolete and
      counter-effective: they suppose that those criminal elements are
      too proud and have to be<font color="#cccccc"> stumbled down</font>
      oppressed into subjugation, but they will never peacefully
      subjugate if you make them obey by force, they will still see
      disobeying when they can as the ultimate good. The truth is those
      guys are underpriviliged and thus already humiliated by their
      lives. So the phenomenon we see is only their hypercompensation.
      Thus it's growing the self-esteem of those individuals is what's
      to be done to solve their misbehavio<font color="#999999">u</font>r.


      They never think that being detained by police and force to sleep
      where hobo slept before him, in the same room with public toilet
      is humiliating, it's incredible that they consider stealing less
      shameful than asking help from their parents.<br>
      Parents probably humiliate them, because that's how they were
      nourished themselves by their silly parents. They are not very
      smart and it's the first humiliation. They're not rich too, and
      that's another one, and the one that gets to them, they don't
      usually focus on that smart part. But if technologies give them
      additional intellect, who knows where their character takes that
      intelligence. They must be assisted with good psychologic setting,
      so they don't go villain, because it's better to be happy than
      mad. Madness is what intellect rather avoid.<br>
      Например, в застенках я понял что значит что всякая власть от

      linguals. Mне меня я мы. я is anomaly, but if I прибегаю к мы, то
      и во втором лице вы должно быть.<br>
      <br>
      Мы Вы Те or We You They or Я Вы Они or Я Вы Те выглядит более
      алфавитна, но Те вместо Они is cherrypicking. indeed. But let's
      guess that it's the structure of the alphabet. It could be Мы Ты
      Он and tell that B is the first letter and BCE is the actual
      order, WeTheeIt, 1st 2nd 3rd, the natural order and the only one
      we know. We Mы Me Wo, but why don't we take hebrew and japanese
      (ani &amp; anata, very similar, but that n could be m, but
      japanese inverts the meaning of hebrew suffix, like вы for we. So
      that doesn't go far, but japanese do.. watakushi has that very wa.
      atashi probably plural for я. -tachi is plural suffix in japanese.
      watashi is the synonym of atashi (some stylistic difference) and
      the short for watakushi, which shows that wa for we could be
      linked to йа of я.<br>
