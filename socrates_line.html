          But I’m rather crazy too, so I have to notice that Plato was
          speaking of YOUNG boys, and men were considered old earlier,
          so those young could be considered little today. For example,
          in archaic jewish tradition bar mitzvah denotes a man adult in

            selfpreservance. a better way is to hide away under the
            surface of the planet, learning how to measure pressure
            around and how to move around under the ground, building
            structures there if needed, but let those structures be
            transportable, so that if somebody hears you and starts
            digging, you just move under his house to know him better,
            and if he's a good fellow, you behave as a decent
            intraterrestrial, a&nbsp; decent fellow would never dig
            under someone else's construction,. especially becausse
            those are supposed to stand on solid rock, so I'd move it
            away not to care of what smart monkeys on the surface are
            doing. I'd say other intelligent entities too, but I'm not
            sure we'll allow tigers to be smart. only if tiger is so
            smart that he understands ethics, not all humans do, btw,
            but would we allow dumb humans to turn into smart tigers?

            takes them lots of funds to build it, so wait, don't die of
            something stupid. writing such books I take my chances, I
            also build my chances offering EVERYBODY a service, today
            mostly only well thought advice, but imagine when I'm
            all-productive and being able to share because every thecond
            I make what I need and more, if needed, of course I
            shouldn't overproduce, I just should be able to split like
            cells split, staying in the center of it all, not allowing
            others to conquer MY means of production? yeah, knowing
            lawns even making my owns, having weapons too, but to get
            away is a better strategy, teaching earthling a lesson

                                  Меня, конечно, станут обвинять в
                                  антисемитизме, однако, у меня есть три
                                  сильных адвоката. И никто иные, как
                                  три кита сионизма.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Первый мой адвокат - идеолог сионизма
                                  Теодор Герцль, сионист номер один,
                                  который, в своём дневнике писал, что
                                  он считает антисемитизм полезным для
                                  дела еврейского народа.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Второй мой адвокат - Владимир
                                  Жаботинский.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Он, ещё в 1905 году, т. е., во время
                                  первой русской революции писал: Как
                                  довод для сионистской агитации
                                  антисемитизм, особенно возведённый в
                                  принцип, конечно, весьма удобен и
                                  полезен.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Ну и третий мой адвокат - сам
                                  премьер-министр Израиля - Бен Гурион.
                                  Он, в своё время, писал в еврейской
                                  газете Кемпфер в Нью-Йорке:<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Если бы у меня была не только воля, но
                                  и власть, я бы подобрал группу сильных
                                  молодых людей. Задача этих молодых
                                  людей состояла бы в том, чтобы
                                  замаскироваться под неевреев и,
                                  действуя методами грубого
                                  антисемитизма, преследовать евреев
                                  антисемитскими лозунгами.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Я могу поручиться, что результаты, с
                                  точки зрения значительного притока
                                  эмигрантов в Израиль из этих стран,
                                  были бы в 10 раз больше, чем
                                  результаты, которых добились тысячи
                                  эмиссаров чтением бесплодных
                                  проповедей.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  С этими тремя моими адвокатами, китами
                                  сионизма, тесно перекликаются
                                  знаменитые Протоколы сионских
                                  мудрецов, написанные как известно
                                  Ашером Гинзбергом, как политическая
                                  программа Хасидизма (наиболее
                                  изуверская секта иудаизма) для своих
                                  европейских единоверцев - очередная
                                  попытка объединения сил, предпринятая
                                  Ашером, ещё до первого конгресса
                                  сионистов.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  В этом историческом документе чётко
                                  говорится, что антисемитизм нужен им
                                  для лучшего управления своими меньшими
                                  братьями.</font></font></font></span></span></font></font></font></font></span></span></font></font><br>
