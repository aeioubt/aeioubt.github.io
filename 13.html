        it is in a draft stage, it is how drafts should be immediately
        published to remove the institutions which slows the spread of
        knowledge down or even stops it sometimes. This free flow of
        knowledge is filled with all sorts of the beasts, scientific and
        not, so readers have to be able to figure them out themselves.<br>
        And this status of this text allows me to fancy all sorts of
        wild hypotheses, like this pondering here:</font><br>
      <br>
      Are <br>
      Should of<br>
      Could of<br>
      Would of <br>
      Instead of <br>
      Shoud have<br>
      Could 'ave<br>
      Would've<br>
      Just mistakes or dialectal forms? Are "of" and "have" cognates?<br>
      Jars of rice = Jars have rice<br>
      <br>
      Then is firstable making "able" a variant of "of all"?<br>
      "ab" is "of" in latin, but I still don't think so.<br>
      and in protogermanic too:
      https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/ab<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">And that have=of thing, if they really used
        to be cognates and sometimes still are, that is of that period
        when belonging was not expressed in the language more clearly
        (do a man has worms or do they have him? many such cases) so "I
        have you" tells that you belong to me, while "I of you" tells
        that I belong to you. And because usually we belong to
        eachother, that could be acceptable for awhile, but there's a
        mathematica term for such cases, but I always ignored
        terminology, so I'm not sure if it's reversibility, either way,
        it's not having that (if I have you it tells nothing about if
        you have me or not, but it does tell that you belong to me, kind
        of, anyway, it's all ridiculously useless, let's colour it grey)</font><br>

      Today I saw that galo 'round a burning match again. This time it
      seemed to be like steps, quantized drop in luminosity of the ball
      around the flame with another lrop drop at some santimeter or so
      (I didn't measure then, though I tried it some more and it stinks
      with matches, and ventilation turns on the light in that room, so
      I do the next time, on thursday again. I was surprised toknow that
      do to da today is thursday as I think was the previous time. On
      friday guests came so I couldn't repeat, I should check the
      records at the previous volume, or I should keep on burning match
      (and I was recomended a candle, because it burns longer, gives
      time to observe, and I think it stinks much less, so I have to buy
      me a candle or to do it at home. There are many rooms ldark rooms
      at my place, and lack of the external light is essential, though
      probably one source of light is to be, not direct one maybe,
      exactly, not direct, at my right front there was the burning
      match, at my left front was the toilet room with точечные
      светильники at rather high cieling and the wall above the door cut
      their direct light off, so you could only see the well-lit room
      there. So I have two interpretation of what I saw: enegetic
      orbitals of the heat radiation (of which I thought before: heat is
      a wave, so like sound it should have harmonics) or quant nature of
      theworld make the light intensity drop by degrees (by stairs,
      quantized, raster)<br>
      But what is more important than the light is that morning
      relaxation of the eyes, and maybe thursday too, but that is yet to
      figure out. It seems the cycle of seven days was never broken: <font
        size="+1">the reform advanced the date by 10 days: Thursday 4
        October 1582 was followed by Friday 15 October 1582.</font><br>
      But interesting how russians were fucked by that reform:<br>
      <font size="+1">В России юлианский календарь обычно называют
        старым стилем, переход на новый стиль (григорианский календарь)
        был осуществлён 14 февраля 1918 года декретом Совнаркома,
        подписанным В. И. Лениным 26 января 1918 года. </font><br>
      Just before the anniversary of the February Revolution. Must've
      disoriented the opposition that decree.<br>
      And there are more mysteries:<br>
      <font size="+1">The Gregorian reform shortened the average
        (calendar) year by 0.0075 days to stop the drift of the calendar
        with respect to the equinoxes.[3] Second, in the years since the
        First Council of Nicaea in AD 325,[Note 1] the excess leap days
        introduced by the Julian algorithm had caused the calendar to
        drift such that the (Northern) spring equinox was occurring well
        before its nominal 21 March date. This date was important to the
        Christian churches because it is fundamental to the calculation
        of the date of Easter. To reinstate the association, the reform
        advanced the date by 10 days: Thursday 4 October 1582 was
        followed by Friday 15 October 1582.[3] In addition, the reform
        also altered the lunar cycle used by the Church to calculate the
        date for Easter, because astronomical new moons were occurring
        four days before the calculated dates. </font><br>
      But in russia it was 13 days. Three extra leap days passed between
      16th and 20th centuries? 1700, 1800, 1900 (1600 was not considered
      leap according to the gregorian system)<br>
      <font size="+1">The Julian calendar has been replaced as the civil
        calendar by the Gregorian calendar in all countries which
        officially used it. Turkey switched (for fiscal purposes) on 16
        February/1 March 1917. Russia changed on 1/14 February 1918.[96]
        Greece made the change for civil purposes on 16 February/1 March
        1923</font><br>
      Turkey started this movement. Let's also not forget that the head
      of orthodox church is in konstantinopole, which is occupied by
      turkey today.<br>

      <font color="#cccccc">парша в русском языке настолько неоднзначное
        слово. но все значения походу означают разные грибы: парша

      И здесь возникает вопрос: (это литературное оформление, совершенно
      излишнее семантически)<br>
      какова связь между Б и К? она определённо там есть, потому что на

      Был Жил тоже может быть отражением этого феномена.<br>

      Но мы отвлекаемся. Давайте сравним ещё несколько примеров перфекта<br>
      I went&nbsp; ~&nbsp; I've gone<br>
      Я шёл ~ Я ушёл<br>
      Но это неправильные глаголы, у нормальных вторая и третья форма

      Я замечал ~&nbsp; Я заметил<br>
      Окэй, хир ис эназа уэй ту мэйк пёрфект ин рашн.<br>
      Я рубил ~&nbsp; Я зарубил<br>
      И снова вопрос: З это staveless В?<br>
      У~За~При~<br>
      переходил ~ перешёл (первая форма неперфект, вторая перфект)<br>
      ходил ~ шёл (полные синонимы, ни одна форма не перфект) это очень
      странно, нелогично, и наверное подобные приколы вызывают у
      иностранов основной бугурт.<br>
      <br>
      шёл краткая форма от слова ходил<br>

      буду (future)<br>
      быть (present indefinite)<br>

      a's? But in english it's more straightforward: <br>
      U for future: Will<br>
      E for present Exist, Est, Is.<br>
      A for past wAs (how is it I highlight one letter in future and the

      I don't know if I told about it (I'm not high and in this
      condition I memorize more than invent) anyway,<br>
      N and S are clockwise and counter-clockwise swasticka's elements,
      which is weird, because if counter-clockwise is отворотный, and
      clockwise is приворотный, then why does N stand for No and S for
      yeS ore Si? is s = t I asked? is "s = c = d?"I ask me now<br>
      d is cl <br>
      D = CL? I saw it today in a dream, where it came to me as Sure it
      is! but what did it look there like which made it obvious? lↃ
      maybe. or lƆ, 𐩧𐩽?<br>
      <br>
      And then I realize, that not only have russians turned their
      letters counter-clockwise, <br>
      so H is И and N is Н, but also lucky people's nations have the
      element of lucky swastika in their alphabet (N) and russians only
      have the element of unlucky one (И)<br>
      <br>
      But then again, what does it tell of S? Is Z more based or what?
      Or does the smooth form of S make it something else? How can it be
      unlucky if it switches from counter-clockwise to clockwise?<br>
      The true answer is I don't know. I only figured that И/N thing
      like few hours ago, what do I know<br>
      <br>
      But it would be a nice experiment if russians would turn their И
      &amp; Н clockwise to get H &amp; N and didn't adopt S, but maybe Z
      though, using C for all S's as they do today, and K's for all K's
      as they do today.<br>
      Z would make their Задница не такой полной.<br>
      are Ж &amp; З жопа и задница? If that's how the alphabet ended
      before numerals IVX were incorporated in their canon, it could
      make perfect sense. Волосы Голова и так далее?<br>
      <br>
      So, the only good explanation for why No uses clockwise
      (приворотный) symbol, and yeS uses the counter-clockwise
      (отворотный символ) is the hypothesis that they used to be the
      other way around, because when these forms were invented people
      drew left to right. But that's just a guess, and it needs some
      data to be proven or disproven, and yet I have a good way to test
      it: we must collect text from the most ancient artifacts, and to
      see how S and N go there, but I think it will fall flat, but I
      have no better explanation of that inconsistency, only if that
      idea of them swastikas encoded in those letters is baseless.<br>
