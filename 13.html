        it is in a draft stage, it is how drafts should be immediately
        published to remove the institutions which slows the spread of
        knowledge down or even stops it sometimes. This free flow of
        knowledge is filled with all sorts of the beasts, scientific and
        not, so readers have to be able to figure them out themselves.<br>
        And this status of this text allows me to fancy all sorts of
        wild hypotheses, like this pondering here:</font><br>
      <br>
      Are <br>
      Should of<br>
      Could of<br>
      Would of <br>
      Instead of&nbsp; <font color="#cccccc">(in such context this
        guess falls apart, but that could be some homonym or something
        else)</font><br>

        color="#999999"> (in usus it is aften the same word, 'ave and
        of. owe awe off)</font><br>
      Could 'ave<br>
      Would've<br>
      Just mistakes or dialectal forms? Are "of" and "have" cognates?<br>
      Jars of rice = Jars have rice<br>
      <br>
      Then is firstable making "able" a variant of "of all"?<br>
      "ab" is "of" in latin, but I still don't think so.<br>
      and in protogermanic too:
      https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/ab<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">And that have=of thing, if they really used
        to be cognates and sometimes still are, that is of that period
        when belonging was not expressed in the language more clearly
        (do a man has worms or do they have him? many such cases) so "I
        have you" tells that you belong to me, while "I of you" tells
        that I belong to you. And because usually we belong to
        eachother, that could be acceptable for awhile, but there's a
        mathematica term for such cases, but I always ignored
        terminology, so I'm not sure if it's reversibility, either way,
        it's not having that (if I have you it tells nothing about if
        you have me or not, but it does tell that you belong to me, kind
        of, anyway, it's all ridiculously useless, let's colour it grey)</font><br>

      Today I saw that galo 'round a burning match again. This time it
      seemed to be like steps, quantized drop in luminosity of the ball
      around the flame with another lrop drop at some santimeter or so
      (I didn't measure then, though I tried it some more and it stinks
      with matches, and ventilation turns on the light in that room, so
      I do the next time, on thursday again. I was surprised toknow that
      do to da today is thursday as I think was the previous time. On
      friday guests came so I couldn't repeat, I should check the
      records at the previous volume, or I should keep on burning match
      (and I was recomended a candle, because it burns longer, gives
      time to observe, and I think it stinks much less, so I have to buy
      me a candle or to do it at home. There are many rooms ldark rooms
      at my place, and lack of the external light is essential, though
      probably one source of light is to be, not direct one maybe,
      exactly, not direct, at my right front there was the burning
      match, at my left front was the toilet room with точечные
      светильники at rather high cieling and the wall above the door cut
      their direct light off, so you could only see the well-lit room
      there. So I have two interpretation of what I saw: enegetic
      orbitals of the heat radiation (of which I thought before: heat is
      a wave, so like sound it should have harmonics) or quant nature of
      theworld make the light intensity drop by degrees (by stairs,
      quantized, raster)<br>
      But what is more important than the light is that morning
      relaxation of the eyes, and maybe thursday too, but that is yet to
      figure out. It seems the cycle of seven days was never broken: <font
        size="+1">the reform advanced the date by 10 days: Thursday 4
        October 1582 was followed by Friday 15 October 1582.</font><br>
      But interesting how russians were fucked by that reform:<br>
      <font size="+1">В России юлианский календарь обычно называют
        старым стилем, переход на новый стиль (григорианский календарь)
        был осуществлён 14 февраля 1918 года декретом Совнаркома,
        подписанным В. И. Лениным 26 января 1918 года. </font><br>
      Just before the anniversary of the February Revolution. Must've
      disoriented the opposition that decree.<br>
      And there are more mysteries:<br>
      <font size="+1">The Gregorian reform shortened the average
        (calendar) year by 0.0075 days to stop the drift of the calendar
        with respect to the equinoxes.[3] Second, in the years since the
        First Council of Nicaea in AD 325,[Note 1] the excess leap days
        introduced by the Julian algorithm had caused the calendar to
        drift such that the (Northern) spring equinox was occurring well
        before its nominal 21 March date. This date was important to the
        Christian churches because it is fundamental to the calculation
        of the date of Easter. To reinstate the association, the reform
        advanced the date by 10 days: Thursday 4 October 1582 was
        followed by Friday 15 October 1582.[3] In addition, the reform
        also altered the lunar cycle used by the Church to calculate the
        date for Easter, because astronomical new moons were occurring
        four days before the calculated dates. </font><br>
      But in russia it was 13 days. Three extra leap days passed between
      16th and 20th centuries? 1700, 1800, 1900 (1600 was not considered
      leap according to the gregorian system)<br>
      <font size="+1">The Julian calendar has been replaced as the civil
        calendar by the Gregorian calendar in all countries which
        officially used it. Turkey switched (for fiscal purposes) on 16
        February/1 March 1917. Russia changed on 1/14 February 1918.[96]
        Greece made the change for civil purposes on 16 February/1 March
        1923</font><br>
      Turkey started this movement. Let's also not forget that the head
      of orthodox church is in konstantinopole, which is occupied by
      turkey today.<br>

      I don't know if I told about it (I'm not high and in this
      condition I memorize more than invent) anyway,<br>
      N and S are clockwise and counter-clockwise swasticka's elements,
      which is weird, because if counter-clockwise is отворотный, and
      clockwise is приворотный, then why does N stand for No and S for
      yeS ore Si? is s = t I asked? is "s = c = d?"I ask me now<br>
      d is cl <br>
      D = CL? I saw it today in a dream, where it came to me as Sure it
      is! but what did it look there like which made it obvious? lↃ
      maybe. or lƆ, 𐩧𐩽?<br>
      <br>
      And then I realize, that not only have russians turned their
      letters counter-clockwise, <br>
      so H is И and N is Н, but also lucky people's nations have the
      element of lucky swastika in their alphabet (N) and russians only
      have the element of unlucky one (И)<br>
      <br>
      But then again, what does it tell of S? Is Z more based or what?
      Or does the smooth form of S make it something else? How can it be
      unlucky if it switches from counter-clockwise to clockwise?<br>
      The true answer is I don't know. I only figured that И/N thing
      like few hours ago, what do I know<br>
      <br>
      But it would be a nice experiment if russians would turn their И
      &amp; Н clockwise to get H &amp; N and didn't adopt S, but maybe Z
      though, using C for all S's as they do today, and K's for all K's
      as they do today.<br>
      Z would make their Задница не такой полной.<br>
      are Ж &amp; З жопа и задница? If that's how the alphabet ended
      before numerals IVX were incorporated in their canon, it could
      make perfect sense. Волосы Голова и так далее?<br>
      <br>
      So, the only good explanation for why No uses clockwise
      (приворотный) symbol, and yeS uses the counter-clockwise
      (отворотный символ) is the hypothesis that they used to be the
      other way around, because when these forms were invented people
      drew left to right. But that's just a guess, and it needs some
      data to be proven or disproven, and yet I have a good way to test
      it: we must collect text from the most ancient artifacts, and to
      see how S and N go there, but I think it will fall flat, but I
      have no better explanation of that inconsistency, only if that
      idea of them swastikas encoded in those letters is baseless.<br>

      Another observation of the sun:<br>
      I came home after a fortnight outside, <br>
      <br>
      got high, saw a setting sun, and observed it:<br>
      it was sitting above houses and it seemed that it went up when it
      saw me, and it probably was some optic or psychic illusion; either
      way, I saw some rainbow spectre again and I saw some orbitals:
      light from the sun seemed to have some concentric rounds around
      it, like the one I saw around a burning match but much more in
      number and much tinier in width, and other vision was some отрезки
      спектра как лучи (по радиальным линиям появлялись отрезки
      (одинакового размера, но на разном расстоянии от солнца, кажется
      на каждом геометрическом луче из центра солнца было по одному
      отрезку (я посмотрел и не видел опровержения этого предположения)
      отрезки эти были цвета радуки, т.е. предполагаю что по лучам шёл
      более широкий спектр, и лишь небольшой отрезок<font
        color="#cccccc"> (все отрезки были идентичных размеров и
        окрасов)</font> радугой представлял видимую часть спектра. К
      сожалению, успел заснять лишь зашедшее солнце, но вероятно мой
      телефон не взял бы такую чёткую картинку, тем более против солнца.

      as you can see, the sky itself is also a rainbow: it goes from red
      to blue with some lack of green, and yellow is only in the clouds,
      I'm not sure it counts, it could be just some red and blue which
      are just on spectre, but are not of spectral nature.<br>
      Either way, I will find some good optics and will film it, I think
      I will contact some profession photographer tomorrow, or even two.
      <br>
      <br>
      I hope I will deliver soon in language thing with that a-b, a-d,
      when I literally divided words by meaningless letters. So vowel is
      no, and consonant is yes? consonants are different: b is in, d is
      off (de)<br>
      but something, vowels are just connecting voice, and probably
      first consonants were meaningful and vowels were just melodical.
      And later they began to use vowels as negation, but it probably
      grew out of <font color="#cccccc">interjunctions </font>interjections

      Something similar to what I observe around the light source is
      Brocken Spectre, but what I observe has nothing to do with water,
      it can be seen in absolutely dry room, photos are yet to come, but
      here what I could find so far:<br>

      That pink part is called Belt of Venus, and the blue beneath it is
      the shadow of the Earth.<br>
      But the phenomenon I want to discover even more is the way some
      tiny light source behaves in a dark room or a plane: when you
      raise your hand between your eyes and the source, the light is
      closed from the opposite direction, I wonder if it has something
      to do with camera obscura flipping the image or is it some glitch
      in the matrix. I will write more about it when I know more about
      it.<br>
      <br>
      So my guess is what?<br>
      tthere are several:<br>
      <br>
      Because light is of wave nature, that wave has some spectre and
      thus makes rainbow? <br>
      But sound is a wave and it may keep the same tone. Sun also as any
      star has it's <br>
      That word rainbow I use all the time is not the phenomenon of
      rainbow we kow, but more wide concept of iridescence. I'm not even
      sure this term is correct, so I simply say rainbow, so everybody
      knows what sequence of colours I am speaking of.<br>
      Either way, this topic is its deception, and I will deliver on it
      more coherent and legible.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      New thing I found today is that word "sweet!" may sound as sucking
      something up, like a noodle or with a straw, almost a kiss.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      All the story is written down. But it is written one piece at a
      time at some place.<br>
      Aum is only known to europeans as omen, in plural. Aum is one
      sound, not three, it's a nasal A.<br>
      An. One. <br>
      A is potentially nasal, and maybe that's the route some people
      pronounce it as O<br>
      Some nations pronounce pot with o, and others use [a] instead.
      Americans do, and that other channel I've shown you tell that it's
      more ancient form of english:<br>
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p_BFdOjZVE<br>
      or<br>
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRrsSPddg6A<br>
      and it's in russian.<br>
      here is where he tells that americans read o as a:
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56qwv_Jcg3c<br>
      <br>
      And watching that previous video, where he tells that hot dog is
      somewhere pronounced as hat dog, and before that cot and caught is
      compared, and both are a's, and it comes to me that o and u are
      just variants of <i>a</i>. <br>
      a is the full form, and o and u are underdrawn.<br>
      And because double a is o in dannish, <br>
      And bornholm runes are dannish, and there o is ᚮ the double ᛆ the
      a, and aa is o too.<br>
      o is pure a, the golden middle between <i>a</i> and <i>u</i> <br>
      u is oo, so it's a, aa=o, oo=u<br>
      o is in the middle. A is a cool way to pronounce it. It was the
      same, Om, Aum aUm it also was some accord, согласованное
      последовательное движение звука по спектру как радука.<br>
      Радуга is not alphabetic, otherwise imagine how extatic I would
      be, Would I? Raduga have some transparent etymology, but then you
      have to recognize that russians built pyramids? Or at leasgt that
      russians worshipped Rah. Rah-shins (shin is humans? 神 is shen, god
      in chinese. in japanese it's shin.<br>
      清 is shin in japanese, qing dinasty of china, where it's also
      clear, clean, distinct, quiet, thoroughly, completely, and it
      sounds like chin, that how chinese transliteration of qing is
      read.<br>
      心 is shin in japanese, xin in chinese, sounds as schin (щинь) and
      as japanese didn't destinguish x from q, so is both words are
      written as しん in hiragana. Weird transliterations of x and q was
      from portuguese and who knows who else, so I think, but who knows
      if it's true. Because they didn't have russian щ. That is
      palatalized sh, which is x. but q is ch. And it reminds me of
      gothic alphabet:<br>

      <br>
      as you can see, in comparison to lating it has some letters
      lacking strokes at the top: R looks like K, <br>
      B looks like upsided down R, D lacks part of the stroke, Q of 6
      and Q of 90 lack a stroke at the top, and that makes it remind Ч,
      as that q sounds in chinese, which I discuss above.<br>
      What's going on? I didn't change the масштаб, but letters seem to
      be tinier, and they're in the same font. Is it another example of
      world shrinking and we getting used to it and then we croak, I
      thought there was some term closer to shrink, but it seems google
      translator get worse: it doesn't know скопытиться, but mistake it
      for скопить или скопиться.<br>
      And then I kind of get used to this font and it looks normal. But
      that font at the front line seems smaller because it's compared to
      the similar (but slightly larger) font above it, in the image.<br>
      <br>
      Notice, how gothic p reminds u standing before it, and very
      similar to ᚢ.<br>

      vowels bowels? vow is bow? I didn't expect bowels here, I only

      <br>
      bow is not only a gesture of reverence, but also a weapon. and
      that weapon bow did use bowels as its string and a gut called
      catgut (though it's usually made of sheep's gut) is used in
      musical instrument which is played with some other bow, the
      fiddle-bow (fiddlestick is rememed by some comix creature) but
      that bow the fiddle bow uses hair instead of guts, so they play
      with horse hair against sheep guts. And that is very pleasant to
      them. It's very pleasant to me too, I think I've shown you this

      Today I managed to take the photos of the setting sun, but I
      didn't see the rainbow rays rayin'bows? either way, but mostly
      because I was focused on the phone. photos, phone.. it was not
      together at first, it is funny, because now they are. So the most
      rainbowish rays are on this one, and they're not very rainbowish,
      not very iridescent. Either way, the experiment was not pure
      because of the clouds above the sun, but there was no or almost no
      clouds directly at the sun:<br>

      so that the spectre of the sun itself from red on its outside (and

      but most of the time the sun itself was iridescent: redish
      orangish periphery, yellowish greenish closer to the sun and some
      pale blue in the centre. Is it the closest to the white because
      it's the most radiant, the most powerful part of the spectrum, so
      we're taught that sun is mostly ultraviolet? But that is not blue
      but grey, it only looks blueish against that yellow.<br>

      first Б was the head of the hourse. Then A became that, but
      probably in different places they came at different time the
      tradition and the change in the writing system. Is it why
      georgians call daddy baba and mommy dada?<br>
      <br>
      un of under as под is seen in по standing for on. and because п

      maybe on was up, the inhaling form of the same по?<br>
      <br>
      under and под are literally cognates? panda? manda! and suddenly I
      see манда as M(other) underneath.<br>

      neath is translated as под for the sake of translators, not to
      make it obvious that neath has a cognate низ and yet in georgian
      it is translated with a cognate, I wonder if for the sake of
      translator or because they use it like them: <br>

      if s in south is a prefix to the common юг, then is s in север
      also such a prefix? without it it's ever, and that could be the
      name of the polar star. But astronomy tells that it was not the
      polar star all the time. But I doubt it.&nbsp; But either way, for
      the last 4000 years the north pole of the sky is in the three
      dippers of ursae and drago. ursae are female (at least in russian)
      and drago is lingual and probably male (in russian it is) and
      medveditsa are pretty labial in the beginning of the pairs o its
      name: mad and wit (and what if this is the actual etymology? What
      if maed used to make us mad? Because we found some ancient hives
      of tons of high-pressured honey? What if we found where bees lived
      for centuries and we don't know of such places anymoe, because
      they all were robbed millenia ago. since then not only the trees
      are tiny in comparison to what we used to have, but also the hives
      are usually one-year old.<br>
      <br>
      But I have to prove that honey by itself may become intoxicating.
      Lots of honey with the top of the hive broken off by a bear or a
      man can collect rainwater and come through whatever processes turn
      honey into maed. so russian medved for a bear could be not of that
      he knows where the honey is (why would we care) but that it's
      crazy and smart. or mad and wait? or mad and bad? Sometimes "bad"
      is used for something smart, like in badass, it is not something
      bad, it's something awesom, everything good is bad and everything
      bad is good. What if that is a ritual song testifying that the

      [jug] and jug [жуг, что ближе всего к жёг] jug банка? х.з. может
      это линзой было изначально, и банки из стекла линзами назывались?
      jar is not necessarily a jug. but they could be cognates, some

      accepted by both dialects and further into some standard.<br>

      whether is of weather (it is something the future depends on: good
      weather I come, bad weather I won't could be further simplified to

      or then would be the short form of other. other is not there?

      and you can see that when they look at south, it goes pretty much

      So southern sky rotating clockwise and northern sky rotating

      Pythagoras's tetrakti's is indeed the basis of their geometry:<br>
      by using 6 of those triangles you can make a hexagon, and hexagon,
      not pentagon, (<font color="#999999">, = )</font>) is hexan, <br>
      six equilateral triangles make a hexagon and thus 6*10 = 60, the
      masis basis of shumerian math, the elements of which we still have
      the number of minutes and seconds, and maybe months too, but that
      6*10/5, people need brackets in math only when deal with different
      dimensions in one expression: pluses and minuses is
      one-dimensional operations (you need a line to make them) and *
      and / are two-dimensional: you work with plane or other 2d figure
      in that. and if multiplication is applied to both of the sum, you
      need to use brackets for that. And is power 3dimensiona? cube is
      tridimensional. What? Multiplication gives birth to many
      dimension, but.. but.. what is what.. is..<br>
      <font color="#66cccc">an update from the further chapter: √3/2(a)
        tells that you cannot use multiply and divide as freely as yuo
        could change plusses and minuses without the change of sum, and
        if you only in question if you should multiply the upper part or
        all the thing, it doesn't matter, but if it was something like
        10/5*6 then I would demand brackets. And it shows that I could
        be unfit for teaching. Because I improvise too much and thus am
        wrong more often.</font><br>

      It is interesting how Pythagoras might have received that pi
      thing. Is it named after him?<br>
      Was it him? I don't know. Maybe, but then stigler's law of eponymy
      tells that not necessarily, but he probably popularized that math
      a lot, that's how people get things named after them.<br>
      <br>
      And only have I googled hexagon pythagoras, a whole new world of
      trigonometry opened before me with something I never was aware of.<br>
      I found some magic hexagon, super hexagon, but I didn't get it, so
      I don't give it here, I'm just aware of such a thing, but I"m not
      getting it yet.<br>
      So I wanted to show you the pi, I wanted to show you that I think
      there are could be two different pi's as today we don't know if we
      don't have two different c's.<br>
      <br>
      First pi is the S/D and that it is a little larger than 3 you can
      see from the circumscribed circle:<br>

      2a in diametre and 6a in the circumference. But then that red
      circle is larger that the hexagon with the large diagonal laying
      upod the diameter.<br>
      meter measures. meets.<br>
      But then we can look at the blue circle and see that not when it's
      incribed into an hexagon, it sets the upper limit of pi. And when
      we use polygons with more angles, we can approacth that number
      more precisely, so maybe in миллионоугольниках пи всё точнее
      измеряют.<br>
      Но как они поняли, что пи используемое для вычисления площади
      круга то же самое пи?<br>
      Давай закончим предыдущую задачу. Сколько верхняя граница пи
      исходя из гексагона?<br>
      12√(R^<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; -&nbsp; R*3/4)<br>
      that is some wild shit, but that follows from pythagoras theorem,
      in case you don't remember it:<br>
      <br>
      <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="13_files/Pythagoras01.png" alt=""

      <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="13_files/column6-1.gif" alt=""

      but that abc picture of "pythagoras pants" is still retarded, even
      when you draw them like that, because you miss one of the tiangles
      in the lower representation, and if I added it, it would mess the
      upper diagram, so fuck that euclidean pederasty, yeah this book is
      not for little kids, science is hardcore.<br>
      <br>
      just as that √3/2 thing: it follows from that hexagon and the
      pythagoras theorem: x<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> - (a/2)<sup>2</sup><br>
      <br>
      x2 = 3a/4 <br>
      x = √3/2(a), but that is a retarded way to put it, a√3/2 is the
      way to do it.<br>
      <br>
      So the upper limit upon the circumfirence length is it is not
      larger than 12r/√3<br>
      pi = s/d<br>
      thus it's not larger than 6d/√3<br>
      thus pi is not larger than 6/√3 and that 3.4641<br>
      so pi is between 3 and 3.4641<br>
      <br>
      So let's compare formulas to calculate these limits in hexagons,
      octagons, decagons, dodecagons and so on, to see a pattern and try
      to conceive the ultimate formula for the infinite number of
      angles, and there they will probably have infinities in both above
      and below the fraction, and we cannot measure those yet. But I
      just guess, I never try, you do.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe some other day.<br>
      <br>
      Now let's find the areas of those hexagons, and circle's area will
      be laying between them, and we'll see if the same exact numbers
      emerge.<br>
      and to calculate the areas, we have to use the previously
      calculated numbers for circumferences, so the larger hexanon is 6
      times that triangle which equals (R/2)*(R√3)/2 and because that
      √3/2 is the approximation to pi, in principle it is the same pi.
      Let's see for the smaller hexagon: ..<br>
      Do my humanitarian self makes some silly mistakes in math?<br>
      I need some less confusing picture, here it is:<br>
      <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="13_files/1-15.gif" alt=""
        width="328" height="292"><br>
      Now larger hexagon is indeed the radius multiplied at twice the
      side, and that's 12th of that 12r/√3<br>
      Thus larger limit on the one sixth of the circle is r/√3 and thus
      6r/√3 is that whole larger hexagon, and that 6/√3 is the upper
      level of the pi we met before, and we brought it here in that
      circumference.<br>
      And now let's calculate the smaller hexagon: it's 3 rhombi, but
      though then I only have to calculate one side, the h from the
      centre to the side of the hexagon, let's stick to the triangles so
      I don't have to draw those rhombi for you.<br>
      by the Pythagoras theorem, R<sup>2</sup> = (R/2)<sup>2</sup> +
      that h<sup>2</sup><br>
      that that h = √(R<sup>2</sup> - (R<sup>2</sup>/4))<br>
      R*√(3/4) = R*(√3)/2<br>
      thus the area = 6*(R/2)*(R*(√3)/2) = 6*R<sup>2</sup>*(4√3)<br>
      and such pi is 13.8564, thus I made some ridiculous mistake
      somewhere above.<br>
      <br>
      I don't see how that smaller hexagon returns 3 for the lower pi,
      only if √3 will be squared there.<br>
      Let's begin with finding the h. According to the pythagoras
      theorem, h = √(R<sup>2</sup> - (R/2)<sup>2</sup>)<br>
      <br>
      and thus the triangle is (R/2)(√(R<sup>2</sup> - (R/2)<sup>2</sup>))<br>
      and thus the hexagon is 6(R/2)(R√(1-1/4)) = (√3/4)*6R<sup>2</sup><br>
      3√3/2 = 2,598 which is even worse approxiamation than 3, and what
      does it mean? Different pi's only accidentally being the same in
      the circumscribed hexagons?<br>
      <br>
      But more than this I think that I just seriously suck at math.<br>
      <br>
      Let's wait until I or somebody else gets the larger math brains to
      figure that out.<br>
      Because&nbsp; because I suc<font color="#cccccc">hk</font> at
      math. some simple trigonometry and I melt at it.<br>
      <br>
      But "are there two different pi's" is a great question to ask.<br>
      But my math ability is so poor, I couldn't even understand the
      Einstein's proof of the theorem.<br>
      And if that proof is true (it probably is) I have to never
      badmouth him as some freak would do.<br>

      <br>
      But what if that singler's law is at play here again? What if he
      only knew it and share it and got credit for it in both senses,
      and he didn't prove it himself, but he understood it (I still
      didn't) and he also shared it with the world. Why do I care? What
      is this math part is here to do? Hold on, we're coming to
      shumerian soon. Numeral system may have the tightests bonds with
      the alphabets, so we have to see those 6 by 10 thing or was it 4
      by 15? tetractis with the fifth line is 15<br>

      Η as vowel form of it<br>
      H as h~п~f as we can see its behaviour in japanese<br>
      Н is russian N, and thus we have the same form coming in all its
      forms. Whas Moon Noon before? Was Noon канун, was midnight called
      noon (new day, new it, новый он, новый один, новый день)<br>
      the opposite of noon was midi? mid dag? mid-day? noon it is now,
      noon and midnight are the opposites tooday. Who began to call day
      the night or night the day, and we call it a day. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Η H Н have other forms: N И <br>
      and thus the three forms are NHИ or to put it alphabetically, ИHN
      (unless N is M and H is Š)<br>
      if H goes П in japanese, then maybe the actual form of those three
      is ИПN<br>
      how do we know this sequence? like UFH? like lick flatters (льнёт
      лижет льстит)<br>
      льнёт как льёт (истекает слюной ли смазкой ли) <br>
      <br>
      УФХ as ИПН.. well.. maybe.<br>
      <br>
      Х as final T in archaic alphabets<br>
      Н the N is the final in voiced half of the alphabet<br>
      <br>
      u and и are <i>u and и</i><br>
      f and p is the same in hebrew and somewhere else flame пламя,
      fight путч? finger палец?<br>
      H form mysteriously variate from vowel I in greek to deep velar H
      in english and sonor lingual N in russian.<br>
      and thouse U~И and X~T are in this story somewhere, I only

      a good reason not to bother yourself with terminology humanities
      make up, they themselves do not:<br>
      <font size="+1">"Основная терминологическая трудность заключается
        в том, что фундаментальные понятия структурной семантики, такие,
        как «денотат», «сигнификат», «коннотат», «референт» и др.,
        трактуются разными авторами по-разному. Сложилась ситуация,
        когда, употребляя то или иное понятие, необходимо делать ссылку,
        чья трактовка имеется в виду. Например, «денотат в понимании
        Огдена — Ричардса», «сигнификат в понимании Ч, Морриса»..."</font><br>
      <br>
      Recognizing stench and stink as some dialectal cognates, further
      attested for verb or noun, I have to see cognates in branch and
      brink - and that's a good example, and both are probably related
      to brake or bring? Break and bring what is the same? To bring
      something you have to break it off.<br>
      Different orthography in brake is just to distinguish the other
      meaning. But even today ломай здесь означает тормози (но, возможно
      означает поворот. слом стоп.<br>

      wrench wring? ring? wrink<font color="#999999">le</font>?<br>
      <br>
      wrench and wring is great pair.<br>
      <br>
      выкручивать? круг (wring~wrench ring)<br>
      <br>
      w- in wring is that russian в- вкруг (скручивай, даже лучше:
      вкручивай ~ выкручивай. Вкручивая что-то в, ты тем самым
      выкручиваешь что-то из, потому в русском формы включай и выключай
      ещё ближе чем английское от and off, and if o- is un, then n is
      no, and on is laba, нене означающее да у арабов вроде, только ла
      похоже на еврейское ло (нет) а ба похоже на китайское бу (нет) and
      here I must ask are п ~ л? п ~ n! and thus p, n, l are three
      different ways to read п which probably stood for two and p, n, l
      are thus three ways to pronounce two in different languages? but I
      can only see n for japanese ni, and I need to collect the words
      for numbers in different languages from the region of possible
      start of that tradition, because why something that abstract has
      such different names in different languages. Like for how long do
      we know these words?)<br>

      None of these ring any bell. <font color="#cccccc">But what am I
        doing here exactly? <br>
        I think I try to keep on delivering, and now I do it at my
        currently deminished abilities (my sweetest friend made me snort
        amphetamines before we went to some techno party. I could dance
        without that shit the same way or even better, but I am rather
        autistic so I sorta felt like obeying my more extravert friend,
        so after that we had some cocktails and that was supposed to be
        it, but.. what am I doing here? I'm trying to explain why it's
        tuesday now and that day was friday or saturday, and these days
        were rather empty, and no good weed that could kick that shit
        out of my head, some weed, but it's only leaves. So I didn't get
        drunk, but I got about a quarter of liter of wiskey and I don't
        usually drink alcohol, so it will take some time, I will report
        when I feel being at the top of it again. until then, stay safe,
        avoid dirt. And don't forget that those who you admire can ruin
        you (and those you underestimate can save you, so they say, and
        it makes reasonable sense) and my friend didn't drink more than
        one cocktail, but he was vaccinated, and I am not so I was sorta
        paranoid about all those people and no masks allowed (was it not
        allowed? my friend told me not to put it on until we're inside
        and I didn't at all, because when in Rome do like romans do, for
        someone this revolutionary I'm way to conform)</font><br>

      What is interesting about that image is the way it tells that
      scottish D is read as G, or even J, which is super weird, and

      πέντε ~ πέμπτος makes me think that ν used to be v, because μπ is
      b in modern greek, and who knows if it wasn't so in the ancient
      one. As I said, the modern languages are the most firm foundament
      for a research, others are theorized and theories don't describe
      reality as good as reality itself does.<br>

      That was greek, and now the latin:<br>

      The way C flows into G in latin is fascination! ducenti trecenti,
      but quadrigenti and quingenti.<br>
      And the way they repeat q in two neighbouring numbers make me
      remember four five, exactly the quattor <font color="#cccccc">quince.




        quni </font>quinque.<br>
      Which made me ask. How exactly did that letter after P was read?
      Surely not as F? Not as fuattor of four and fuinfue or finfe of
      five? Why I ask is that gothic letter after e is recognized as kw,
      which could be false, because that letter is supposed to be much
      more labial than just some kw, and goths were the neighbouring
      nation of the Rome, so why wouldn't they share their systems a
      little more than we're even taught.<font color="#cccccc"> (the
        gothic alphabet can be seen above (ctrlF gothic) and I'm glad I
        know russian, because if you search the internet for gothic
        script you get all the wrong images, which makes me ask what on
        earth are they trying to hide this way? Or is it just a
        coincidence)</font><br>
      <br>
      Notice, how similar greek and roman words for two and three. And
      notice how greek numerals is similar to russian (except the one,
      which is more different in all latin, greek, russian, so russians
      are what? the next in line to greek and roman, but we know that
      axis as the axis of tradition, but could russian be placed there
      so that it looked as it was the predecessor? Not if all those axes
      are the rays coming out of Greece. The portal culture probably
      taking it from Egypt and all the civilizations in between them.
      Romans wrote it themselves that Greece is their cultural mother,
      at least I was taught the way that I've got that an impression.<br>
      <br>
      (you can see russian numerals in the translation of the latin
      ones)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      And greeks and romans had other ways to write their numerals:<br>
      <br>

          height="512" align="right" border="0"></a><br>
      And it made me thinking, what if some nations just read this
      numbers as I for one, simpli i, double i for 2 as i-i and then
      i-i-i would be хихихи, and that made me see i-i as H and i-i-i as
      Ш and then H is labial? It is a very convenient way to roll this
      letter from vowel in greek to velar in latin to labial in japanese
      dare I say! and in some other cases it is so it seems, why I
      didn't remember where. I should start files for each letter. Let's
      do it for <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="H.html"><font

      The way numerals are read in hebrew: <font size="+1">The 613
        commandments (Hebrew: תרי"ג מצוות‎: taryag mitzvot, "613
        Mitzvot") - 613 is the number of mitzvot in the Jewish Torah. </font><br>
      <br>
      And I theorize how IV would be ю or e, because V is exactly the
      fifth letter then, the way it would be in bornholm canon of ABDEF,
      wherer F is V in hebrew and some other alphbets. what other
      alphbets? In arabic it's w or even u, but that is also how V used
      to be read. maximvs. In georgian! In georgian it's V:<br>

      And I found some source on who could be responsible for the
      creation of georgian alphabet long before christianity, and even
      there I think it is not the alphabet itself was invented then, but
      some font of it:<br>
      <font size="+1">Asomtavruli was probably modelled on the Greek
        alphabet, and Georgian scholars believe that King Pharnavaz I
        (ფარნავაზი) of Kartli (Iberia) created it. </font><br>

      It's hard to say how great and grace are linked, but great and
      grateful seem to be directly related, and then grateful is next to
      full of grace, and then grace is something great, the noun form of
      the adjective great. grays? rays? <br>
      <br>
      I have no idea neither how old this relief is or what does he
      stand upon, but that pattern could demonstrate three forms like
      three mothers. And even if the image is not that old, that element
      could be taken from some ancient artifact standing for just what I
      said. Georgians definitely know something about all that, why
      don't I go to georgia to research this thing? I should write to
      them right now. Okay, I mailed it to the first georgian linguist
      that a search engine delivered. We'll see if I will ever get a
      response. <br>

      labials have the belly at front, if where we go, or in back, if
      letters go there, but it's a back part of it if we apply egyptian
      standard of drawing letters with their faces to the beginning of
      the line. And that standart has its sense and reason: if letters
      are the procession, then those who came first are at the left in
      the left to right direction of writing, and then the procession
      looks at the beginning of the line indeed.<br>

      At this point I do carry in my head more than I had to. Who knows
      what linguistic information is correct and which is not, I just
      noticed myself speaking wrongly on gothic (I used to say that
      gothic q read as f, but in reality gothic u is read as kw, but I
      have to correct myself instead of surprising you in here, because
      why disinform when I can not to. But there are many mistakes,
      forming the lies, and some lies are probably in quotes and pictues
      too, because mistakes of such a form are called simply lies, and
      though it is not immediately recognized as a malicious act, but
      who knows if you yourself believe in what you say or you just want
      to fool us for whatever reason or if you fooled yourself (made a
      mistake) or was fooled by someone else, until that foolishness is
      dangerous <br>

      This text should be like click-bait, very sweet and mellow and

      does it go mea culpa from time totime? Because if you have to
      rephrase, you phrased it poorly just before, speak clearly. Is my

      Rent rental, so al is of, and -ен. in and of are antonyms, neh? <br>
      biologic biological are the synonyms though. so what is -al

      <br>
      post postal, so it's two against one that al is some form of en,
      the притяжательный суффикс, суффикс родительного падежа, что-то
      вроде этого. <br>
      <br>
      офигел ~ офигенен ?<br>
      ах да, ел ещё и суффикс прощедшего времени в русском. postal is
      also posted. And it all comes together because of -ed forms like
      gotten, ridden, run maybe too. sudden? what is sud? situated?<br>
      бегал ~ беган (про ботинки, например)<br>

      What came to my attention first (second after the squares) is
      cross at the beginning of them all. So I suppose they make
      tradition together with glagolitic, and that may say something
      about when glagolythic was introduced, and n'ko is thus some
      ancient writing system. But it's not just parrotted from brahmi,
      because in brahmi cross is k, and in n'ko it is <font
        color="#cccccc">b </font>R<br>
      The way n'ko is aligned is interesting. two times by 7 and the
      third 7 is 6.&nbsp; phnetically though I don't see any system in
      there.<br>
      Triangles are also read differently: e in brahmi and ŋ in n'ko.

      With mercy russians are brave. English brave is in rave, that is

      Oh, some awesome session I had in my bathtub, and thus it is in
      cardboard papers, here's a touch of it:<br>
      Иди с богом, с боком? со споком? сбока собака. <br>
      So was this word born when not only b = d it was, but also god =
      dog it was, as if g and d were separate entities and their
      position was the question of taste and only later dog became the
      totemic animal, and god was the way it was in the dictionary? g-d,
      г-дь, c was g in case you are not aware of it. How am I aware of
      it? I heard it. Is it correct? Honestly I don't know. But it is
      this way in greek and russian. And hebrew too. So it's natural to
      think that it was like that in latin, but I hope they also had
      some archaeologic evidence for that. <br>
      <br>
      voiceless cat reflects laughing, лающую dog. and by k-symmetry it
      reflects. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">jihgfe</font>dg<font color="#cccccc">ba</font><font
        color="#cccccc"><font color="#cccccc">@</font>op</font>qt<font
        color="#cccccc">uvwxyz</font><br>
      actually, this symmetry is aeiou symmetry, it's just the other
      half is reversed to make god just dog, but it's god. гад гав. гаѳ.<br>
      and what about klmn? well, good question, k is singled out in
      k-symmetry, and k is not on its place according to the abcd
      structure, and lmn is element (but I swallowed this etymology, is
      it even true? I read it in more than one place, but it doesn't
      prove it either. So it's like I have to solve the jigsaw puzzle
      where some elements are from some other set, from no set or some
      other way distort the focus, but hopefully I will be able to
      figure it out, because the new and new information keeps on
      coming, and this thing grows not only in width, but also in depth.
      -ал -ан ~ -ed -ed is a superhit. Such a hit that I ask myself
      "haven't I noticed it before?" who cares, if I noticed it, I
      didn't know it, now I do and will be able to use this symmetry in
      some other context, maybe.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">actually at that cardboard there was not
        this last part of dg qt and around "c was g" I went the other
        way, so I will return to that, or it will be in papers, but
        probably not in the papers I will publish in this volume (I said
        I will do it in the previous one, but I'm rather far in this one
        and I still didn't sort them out, but I have already placed it
        on my laptop and converted heic's to jpg's. Now I have to shrink
        them and place them into html's. It's quite a bugger.&nbsp; Will
        do. Especially because the previous portion was in the middle of
        vol.4, and this one is 13 which is easy to remember, or if I
        make it in 14 it will be easy to remember too. We'll see. 4 13
        22 31 40 49 or 4 14 24 34 44 will be with scans of papers, but
        then again who knows how fast will next portion be collected to
        the same size. A witch kinda pulled me down on wasting paper. I
        have to battle her in front of her guy. I believe chicks remove
        bachelors from their boyfriends friend circle not to lose the
        boyfriend to an example of joyous bachelor. Either way, battle
        it will be. She's a friendly witch, that battle will be cuddle
        in a way) but the next folder of carboards which appears on this
        site will contain it, and many more stuff. That witch asked me
        why I fill the papers with the thoughts, and here's why: I have
        these sessions during which I can pull some great ideas out of
        my subconsciousness which is constantly working on this
        linguistic stuff or I weave them directly during those sessions,
        or they come from some other place, either way they're so
        abundant, that it's impossible to ingrane them all in this
        corpus, Actually the thoughts I placed in some vol.5 for example
        would be new to me because I placed them here only to forget by
        my operative memory. <br>
        But I collect all these thoughts to feed them to some ai one
        day, and the cardboards appear because it's inconvenient to work
        on laptop taking a bath, and notebooks appear because sometimes
        notebooks are more comfy or convenient. EIther way, why is this
        graphomania here? place it all in gray gravy, duh.</font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      and I got distracted from the comparing of brahmi to n'ko by that
      bath session. Let's retur to it:<br>
      <br>
      𑀞 is th in brahmi, but ߋ is e in n'ko. So far it looks like these
      forms are similar only by accident, like O is o in latin, and it's
      more similar to n'ko's e, but does it actually relate to it? I
      still doubt it.<br>
      Why doubt if brahmi 𑀥 is almost D, the dha. And brahmi 𑀝 is
      almost C, Ta. But brahmi 𑀞 is tha, nowhere near O, but what if
      it's because it's Θ, for 𑀣 is some other tha, I only vaguely
      imagine the differentce between one with the dot and the one
      without it. <br>
      𑀨 is bha, like what is going on! Is 𑀅 aleph? Is 𑀕 𐤂? Like come
      on! Brahmi is definitely related to something european. And though
      𑀗 reminds reversed נ and 𑀱 could remind С[s] and 𑀳 could remind
      h, 𑀘 (ca) could be related to d, or it all could be so
      speculative and statistically void, that why is it even here, just
      to show that I do what I intended. But I intended to compare
      brahmi ot n'ko. I probably created brahmi to latin before.&nbsp; <br>
      I'm not going to compare brahmi and n'ko, because let the
      non-biased machines do it. I generate ideas, let some other
      entities test them and develop them further. I heard some people
      cannot bring new ideas. Should they leave science immediately or
      should they just use the ideas guys and gals like me have
      contributed. Or I return to this megalyth with ai some day.<br>
      <br>
      Actually such comparisons should be made my ai on the basis of
      hand-written and voiced texts, not on the basis of the table when
      I'm not even sure what the transliterateion means (chinese r is ʒ,
      q is tʃ, x is palatalized ʃ, and so on. Who knows how it is in
      other nations philologies, ai, voiced texts, please)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      So, what can we do without ai and without obscure writing systems?<br>
      <br>
      Let's play with alphabets I do know how to read. How to read
      latin? What about portuguese x I never knew to be ʃ too? is it
      where chinese took their transliterations? well, maybe.<br>
      <br>
      Portuguese портовые guys? Is it why nobody conquered them? <br>
      <br>
      antifa is intifa? intifada? not america first, but israel. israel
      &amp; their insane fuckers.<br>
      insane fucking assholes doing assaninities.<br>
      Why do I say so? Who wants civil war if not asholes? Assholes who
      give shit to th powers that be? <br>
      Isn't it worse when an asshole doesn't give a shit. It's not even
      a question, it is. I guess.<br>
      Then you don't recognize him as an asshole, or is he even asshole
      when he doesn't give a "shit!"?<br>

        russians add greek З to it) ) </font><br>
      then F is fifth, which is great, but the word four (vier as for ו)
      and of how much the form of F reminds 4, it all demands further
      abbreviation of the alphabet. Whether F was before E? for E as 5
      would be normal and graphically it would make sense no less than
      this:<br>

      And then.. is 🯸 7? It would make sense in the 01234567 base set.
      Which is octal, though not the same way roman IVXLCD could be
      octal if X was 8 so I suggest it was before Zen and thus before
      Zero, then some 𓏣, 𓏭, 𓏥, 🯴, 🯵, 🯶, 🯸 or if it was within
      that chart then some 一, 二, 三, 🯴, 🯵, 🯶, 🯸 would be numbers 1 to
      7 (не потому ли семь и восемь настолько похожи в русском?) другое
      дело, что это уже фрикота просто запредельная, но я себе ещё и не
      такое позволяю.<br>

      I only knew this sequence of georgians:<br>

      But I found a much more abundant version:<br>
      ᲐᲑᲒᲓᲔᲕᲖᲗᲘᲙᲚᲛᲜᲝᲞᲟᲠᲡᲢᲣᲤᲥᲦᲧᲨᲩᲪᲫᲬᲭᲮᲯᲰᲱᲲᲳᲴᲵᲶᲷᲸᲹᲺ᲻᲼ᲽᲾᲿ<br>
      and I notice that the font is somewhat different, and indeed there
      is another set:<br>

      <br>
      And I look at the first new letter Ჱ and wiktionary tells that
      it's <font size="+1">Eighth letter of the Georgian alphabet.</font><br>
      I go like what.. and what is it, indeed:<br>

          alt="" width="1500" height="129" border="0"></a><br>
      And I googled "ა ბ გ დ ე ვ ზ თ ი კ ლ მ ნ ო პ ჟ რ ს ტ უ ფ ქ ღ ყ შ ჩ
      ც ძ წ ჭ ხ ჯ ჰ" and I found that I looked into it in vol.8 and many
      other related finds tell that it's quite alright, I was not
      mislead, and here's a piece I found yet in vol.8 and since forgot:
      <font size="+1">The Society for the Spreading of Literacy among
        Georgians, founded by Prince Ilia Chavchavadze in 1879,
        discarded five letters from the Georgian alphabet that had
        become redundant: ჱ ჲ ჳ ჴ ჵ</font><br>
      and 3 or 4 of those 5 did mess up the structure. So did he know of
      that structure (than why didn't he place მ among labial column?
      Maybe because it is მ ნ and some story is connected to them, but
      not to be this speculative, I have to read into what that prince
      Ilia Chavchavadze wrote about why he removed those particular
      letters. Could it be that they were introduced by christeners and
      yet georgians never applied those letters or those sounds? A
      hypothesis, of course, I have to begin with Daniels, Peter T.
      (1996). The World's Writing Systems. Oxford University Press. ISBN
      978-0-19-507993-7. where that quote links fro wiki where I found
      it.<br>
      And there are many more letters I can explore: <font size="+1">ჶ
        • (f) It is now obsolete in Georgian, but is used in Laz.</font><br>
      when was it introduced, whe has it become obsolete? questions,
      questions..<br>
      And in vol.8 I pondered on reading some of Chavchavadze and I
      never did, and it's not too fat a chance that I will. I suspect
      that he was never translated into russian and so I asked some
      georgian scholars for help, I hope they answer to unaffiliated
      emails.<br>
      <br>
      And looking into it i found this interesting scan:<br>

      This incident've shown that I don't know what I said, which is

      I pasted out by some tender colours letters that are not in
      glagolythic in the case of samekh or not in latin in the case of
      o, which is omega russian scripts also have. And in yellow it's
      (maybe occasionally, as words with f are foreign in rusian, a
      labial following the vowel omega. and it actually reminds hebrew
      coursive ף and ф and φ at the same time. So it could be borrowing
      from coursive hebrew or some other font of the region, some
      archaic forms of f are very similar yet I don't remember where,
      either way that armenian letter links hebrew coursive form to
      greek and even russian fert or is it fita, because armenian has
      more similar fert just above it. Why don't I use the armenian
      font? <br>
      I can't believe I never even copied it in my workbook of unicodes
      till this moment.<br>

      If it was so much changed, it is probably containing some secrets
      underneath it all.<br>
      <br>
      It's funny how armenian is so much different from latin, yet it
      has a little larger but exactly the same հ with the same phonetic
      meaning. <br>
      ՠ is some obsolete vowel, and that's literally reversed ա and the
      way Աա is majuscule and minuscule of the same letter make me
      remember Uw and the way it's followed by Բբ reminds me of УФ,
      which makes me think that maybe U-line is armenian? And then that
      գ the Գգ reminding q the most of all, which makes me ask, is
      U-line also O-line, the way it starts with ע in hebrew? <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">following = followed by</font><br>

      Graphomania is wish to write when one has nothing to say. Every
      writer has such thing, the wish to write is not directly linked to
      the something to say in the process, only in the beginning of the
      book it must be present (exist persist) <br>
      persist present <br>
      exist isn't? ex not? is ис из!<br>
      easy is наречная форма слова is (you can do it by simply being
      there)<br>
      hard have to do.<br>
      <br>
      Isn't it beautiful? And<font color="#339999"> I didn't have to say
        it, </font>I didn't know what is there before I began writing:<br>
      <font color="#339999">I didn't hard to say? no, hard is have to
        do. It would be hard if it was what you have to do to say it.<br>
      </font>So it's good to start writing without having something to
      say? No, I began because I had something to say: I was going to
      say about graphomany, that I should avoid it. I mentioned it
      because I was wondering what a weird disease motivating you to do
      something. Now I understand. That graphomany piece would be of
      borderline with pure graphomany, because why was it here? or would
      be here, because it's rather off-topic in this work. But I collect
      here all the worthy pieces, very rarely do I <br>
      <br>
      And because hard is disassembled into have to do, thus that r is
      rhotacism, if I'm using the term right, I only learnt its spelling
      just now. The t between vowels, give it away now. But that is not
      what I wanted to say! r in hard is japanese verbal suffix ru,
      which rlates to russian -ть which relates to english to. But we
      only know it as japanese, because there it is purely ru, but
      articulatoilly it's not that far from russian -ть and semantically
      they're cognate, and only theorizing of modern (not so modern,
      btw) linguistics tell us that japanese and russian can't relate.
      Why can't they? By geopolitical reasons, I suppose. Divide et
      empera all along. Those parasites now inevitably fuck off, but
      what are they going to fuck up then? They will find something new,
      so before their sociopathy is cured or cuped, we'll have their bs
      around.<br>
      <br>
      be of me<br>
      bs of the boss<br>
      bm of the wife? b-m as s<font color="#cccccc">h</font>ort for
      bdsm? that's what I saw.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">sort of bdsm</font><br>
      short for bdsm<br>
      short form of bdsm<br>
      -m of is sort of redundant and could be some m.f. мат.<br>
      <br>
      So graphomania has to be dealt with during the editing: you have
      to check is the paragraph is beautiful or if it tells something
      important. Perfect text is both, so meaningless passages have to
      be removed<font color="#cccccc">, because even if they're pretty,
        emptiness of the text is ugly. Now this chapter is ugly in style
        and what is it? These two sentences are the least meaningful, so
        be concise. Leave only important pieces. So repetitions and
        shallow speculations go away. But repetitia matria lectiones или
        что-то типа того. забей, сажа. пепел, сон<br>
        (those three words can be seen as pretty by some, but what's the
        other use of them? none)</font><br>
      and ugly passages have to be rewritten.<br>
      and really beautiful things should be ingraned into some
      meaningful context.<br>

      k is some weird spelling so these two could be cognates, and
      they're probably cognates of school.<br>
      <br>
      and school is of scold, scold is schooled? <br>
      <br>
      He who scolded probably school. But suffixes tell otherwise:<br>
      Scold ~ Schooled. are these even cognates or am I a poet again?<br>
      Are soldiers scolded? They school themselves. Schools are military
      institutions.<br>

      <br>
      And then I looked at the semantic part of that word. And I saw

      Kill is Cool. Cool is the verb, to cool someone. Cold is the noun?

      </font>To kill is успокоить, остудить. Naturally to etymologize it
      like this I had to know that people get cold when they're killed
      without variants, so we have semantic cognatism, which also

      4:20 in few minutes, let's take another one. I read on reddit
      yesterday that a guy smokes one toke once and then the second one

      how often does he smoke? Okay, let's test his way, 2 minutes,

        is 重ね掛ける, but by that 重 alone I can see that it's some technical
        to lap, a homonym.<br>
        to lick in japanese is not only なめる (nameru), but also 舐める
        (nameru), 嘗める (nameru), <br>
        and the same hieroglyph can be read differently: 舐る (neburu),
        舐ぶる (nebu buru)<br>
        so without the l. interesting. no it's not.</font><br>

        of russian сама? Сам это очень почтительное местоимение в
        русском, правда употребляется оно в этом значении лишь в третьем

      I feel desperate sometimes, but then I know that the darkest hour
      is right before the dawn.<br>
      And haven't I recognized the first several letters?<br>
      a- not<br>
      b- in (ab = not in, off)<br>
      c- with (co-)<br>
      d- of (de = of, ad = to)<br>
      e- ex-<br>
      <br>
      and suddenly I notice, that a- is probably indeed added later, and
      b was the first letter and vowels were invented much later (or
      they were used independently as vowels or who knows what, as
      musical notes I wanted to say, but my subconsciousness tells
      they're vowels, they were used as vowels, Vocalize is of vocales.
      Not notes, but vowels were used to sing? <br>
      <br>
      The concept of musical notes, of musical tones, probably appeared
      much later than the concept of vowels, because about vowels every
      human seems to know, and music is known only to a tiny fraction of
      society. So u of music stands the last after a of mathematgic and
      i of mystic mythic fairytales:<br>
      numbers exist even in language, they are all words and concepts. <br>
      letters are not even necessarily to create texts, hyeroglyphs are
      not letters, but pictures, only relatively few of them are
      phonetic, and chances are they are also originally words, only
      used as morphemes or maybe even homonymiously as rebuses.<br>
      musical notes are known only two a fraction of literate people,
      the other level of consciousness.<br>
      And maybe scientific signs like ∇ of nabla or del (this is all new
      to me, in russian they call it оператор Гамильтона) and ℒ of
      lagrangian the fourth level of symbolism or are they also part of
      mythic corpus, the part of the narrative, not that much different
      from &amp; and @?<br>
      Is Δ Laplace operator? And I look for it and I see they say that Δ
      is ∇<sup>2</sup> and that is a field which I understand not more
      than I understang music at the technical, which is almost not at
      all. As a fan I understand it impressively well, but while fan has
      fun, professional fans are also known as profans, but then I see
      that english only knows profanity which could be a related , but a
      completely different term. In russian профан is what is translated
      into english as layman, which is a rather polite and mellow form
      to put it. Ignoramus is closer to it. Outsider is the other
      variant G-translator offers. Why do I like google so much? I use
      their products and haven't payed them a buck. What is not to like.<br>

      As for that rainbow epos, currently I think my eyelashes caused
      the sunrays difract like that: I saw rainbowish effect from some
      sun rays again, but then I removed the hair from my face and it
      went away, so my current guess is that I didn't look at the sun
      with my eyes fully opened or I had some head hair across them and
      I didn't notice. I have to make some difraction pattern in front
      of my camera to try and film it. So far my friend hearing of that
      experiment has shown me this wild thing. It's all black and white,
      but you can see all kinds of things:<br>
      (the original video will be uplead later to avoid the size limit
      for a package)<br>
      To make it rotate clockwise, I inverted the video, so you can
      compare them to see if they make any effect. I made it so because
      I felt uneasy of the original shit, but that could be placebo, I
      noticed the direction before I felt it.<br>

            class="short_text" lang="zh-TW"></span></span></video> <br>
      Here it is obvious how clockwise rotation is luckier: that horn is
      taken out, not piercing forward.<br>
      But technically instead of reversing the video I could simply
      mirror it left to right or upside down, and then it would be the
      other way around, so unless it's some fundamental fuction of
      reality (so biological crystals rotate the light I think to the
      left, and it sorta contradicts the idea of right being alright,
      but I yet have to revisit biochemistry and hopefully to make it on
      video to show you here in some vol.20 or where will it happen<font

      赤 akai, красный. ake, красно. red. could be in the centre of 開
      (also ake, open)<br>
      and at the periphery of it is 明 also ake, even though sometimes ke
      is another symbol, sometimes it's not:<br>
      明方 【あけがた】、明けがた 【あけがた】 akekata, dawn.<br>
      Red for opening is natural, because red is the beginning of the
      rainbow spectre. Or if it's only mnemonic I don't care.<br>
      明 is also read as Akira or Ming and it stands for bright, clear,
      next, to understand, to know and Ming.<br>
      <br>
      And I probably was disinformed on 明 standing for ake and not only
      a, because <br>
      明けましておめでとうございます returns 13,800,000 results<br>
      明ましておめでとうございます returns only 2,690 results<br>
      あけましておめでとう！ returns 23,300,000 results<br>
      あけましておめでとう returns 24,900,000 results<br>
      あけおめ returns 4,980,000 results<br>

      But that's a lucky disinformation, because, as in the case of 明方
