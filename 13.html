        it is in a draft stage, it is how drafts should be immediately
        published to remove the institutions which slows the spread of
        knowledge down or even stops it sometimes. This free flow of
        knowledge is filled with all sorts of the beasts, scientific and
        not, so readers have to be able to figure them out themselves.<br>
        And this status of this text allows me to fancy all sorts of
        wild hypotheses, like this pondering here:</font><br>
      <br>
      Are <br>
      Should of<br>
      Could of<br>
      Would of <br>
      Instead of <br>
      Shoud have<br>
      Could 'ave<br>
      Would've<br>
      Just mistakes or dialectal forms? Are "of" and "have" cognates?<br>
      Jars of rice = Jars have rice<br>
      <br>
      Then is firstable making "able" a variant of "of all"?<br>
      "ab" is "of" in latin, but I still don't think so.<br>
      and in protogermanic too:
      https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/ab<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">And that have=of thing, if they really used
        to be cognates and sometimes still are, that is of that period
        when belonging was not expressed in the language more clearly
        (do a man has worms or do they have him? many such cases) so "I
        have you" tells that you belong to me, while "I of you" tells
        that I belong to you. And because usually we belong to
        eachother, that could be acceptable for awhile, but there's a
        mathematica term for such cases, but I always ignored
        terminology, so I'm not sure if it's reversibility, either way,
        it's not having that (if I have you it tells nothing about if
        you have me or not, but it does tell that you belong to me, kind
        of, anyway, it's all ridiculously useless, let's colour it grey)</font><br>

      Today I saw that galo 'round a burning match again. This time it
      seemed to be like steps, quantized drop in luminosity of the ball
      around the flame with another lrop drop at some santimeter or so
      (I didn't measure then, though I tried it some more and it stinks
      with matches, and ventilation turns on the light in that room, so
      I do the next time, on thursday again. I was surprised toknow that
      do to da today is thursday as I think was the previous time. On
      friday guests came so I couldn't repeat, I should check the
      records at the previous volume, or I should keep on burning match
      (and I was recomended a candle, because it burns longer, gives
      time to observe, and I think it stinks much less, so I have to buy
      me a candle or to do it at home. There are many rooms ldark rooms
      at my place, and lack of the external light is essential, though
      probably one source of light is to be, not direct one maybe,
      exactly, not direct, at my right front there was the burning
      match, at my left front was the toilet room with точечные
      светильники at rather high cieling and the wall above the door cut
      their direct light off, so you could only see the well-lit room
      there. So I have two interpretation of what I saw: enegetic
      orbitals of the heat radiation (of which I thought before: heat is
      a wave, so like sound it should have harmonics) or quant nature of
      theworld make the light intensity drop by degrees (by stairs,
      quantized, raster)<br>
      But what is more important than the light is that morning
      relaxation of the eyes, and maybe thursday too, but that is yet to
      figure out. It seems the cycle of seven days was never broken: <font
        size="+1">the reform advanced the date by 10 days: Thursday 4
        October 1582 was followed by Friday 15 October 1582.</font><br>
      But interesting how russians were fucked by that reform:<br>
      <font size="+1">В России юлианский календарь обычно называют
        старым стилем, переход на новый стиль (григорианский календарь)
        был осуществлён 14 февраля 1918 года декретом Совнаркома,
        подписанным В. И. Лениным 26 января 1918 года. </font><br>
      Just before the anniversary of the February Revolution. Must've
      disoriented the opposition that decree.<br>
      And there are more mysteries:<br>
      <font size="+1">The Gregorian reform shortened the average
        (calendar) year by 0.0075 days to stop the drift of the calendar
        with respect to the equinoxes.[3] Second, in the years since the
        First Council of Nicaea in AD 325,[Note 1] the excess leap days
        introduced by the Julian algorithm had caused the calendar to
        drift such that the (Northern) spring equinox was occurring well
        before its nominal 21 March date. This date was important to the
        Christian churches because it is fundamental to the calculation
        of the date of Easter. To reinstate the association, the reform
        advanced the date by 10 days: Thursday 4 October 1582 was
        followed by Friday 15 October 1582.[3] In addition, the reform
        also altered the lunar cycle used by the Church to calculate the
        date for Easter, because astronomical new moons were occurring
        four days before the calculated dates. </font><br>
      But in russia it was 13 days. Three extra leap days passed between
      16th and 20th centuries? 1700, 1800, 1900 (1600 was not considered
      leap according to the gregorian system)<br>
      <font size="+1">The Julian calendar has been replaced as the civil
        calendar by the Gregorian calendar in all countries which
        officially used it. Turkey switched (for fiscal purposes) on 16
        February/1 March 1917. Russia changed on 1/14 February 1918.[96]
        Greece made the change for civil purposes on 16 February/1 March
        1923</font><br>
      Turkey started this movement. Let's also not forget that the head
      of orthodox church is in konstantinopole, which is occupied by
      turkey today.<br>

      I don't know if I told about it (I'm not high and in this
      condition I memorize more than invent) anyway,<br>
      N and S are clockwise and counter-clockwise swasticka's elements,
      which is weird, because if counter-clockwise is отворотный, and
      clockwise is приворотный, then why does N stand for No and S for
      yeS ore Si? is s = t I asked? is "s = c = d?"I ask me now<br>
      d is cl <br>
      D = CL? I saw it today in a dream, where it came to me as Sure it
      is! but what did it look there like which made it obvious? lↃ
      maybe. or lƆ, 𐩧𐩽?<br>
      <br>
      And then I realize, that not only have russians turned their
      letters counter-clockwise, <br>
      so H is И and N is Н, but also lucky people's nations have the
      element of lucky swastika in their alphabet (N) and russians only
      have the element of unlucky one (И)<br>
      <br>
      But then again, what does it tell of S? Is Z more based or what?
      Or does the smooth form of S make it something else? How can it be
      unlucky if it switches from counter-clockwise to clockwise?<br>
      The true answer is I don't know. I only figured that И/N thing
      like few hours ago, what do I know<br>
      <br>
      But it would be a nice experiment if russians would turn their И
      &amp; Н clockwise to get H &amp; N and didn't adopt S, but maybe Z
      though, using C for all S's as they do today, and K's for all K's
      as they do today.<br>
      Z would make their Задница не такой полной.<br>
      are Ж &amp; З жопа и задница? If that's how the alphabet ended
      before numerals IVX were incorporated in their canon, it could
      make perfect sense. Волосы Голова и так далее?<br>
      <br>
      So, the only good explanation for why No uses clockwise
      (приворотный) symbol, and yeS uses the counter-clockwise
      (отворотный символ) is the hypothesis that they used to be the
      other way around, because when these forms were invented people
      drew left to right. But that's just a guess, and it needs some
      data to be proven or disproven, and yet I have a good way to test
      it: we must collect text from the most ancient artifacts, and to
      see how S and N go there, but I think it will fall flat, but I
      have no better explanation of that inconsistency, only if that
      idea of them swastikas encoded in those letters is baseless.<br>

      Another observation of the sun:<br>
      I came home after a fortnight outside, <br>
      <br>
      got high, saw a setting sun, and observed it:<br>
      it was sitting above houses and it seemed that it went up when it
      saw me, and it probably was some optic or psychic illusion; either
      way, I saw some rainbow spectre again and I saw some orbitals:
      light from the sun seemed to have some concentric rounds around
      it, like the one I saw around a burning match but much more in
      number and much tinier in width, and other vision was some отрезки
      спектра как лучи (по радиальным линиям появлялись отрезки
      (одинакового размера, но на разном расстоянии от солнца, кажется
      на каждом геометрическом луче из центра солнца было по одному
      отрезку (я посмотрел и не видел опровержения этого предположения)
      отрезки эти были цвета радуки, т.е. предполагаю что по лучам шёл
      более широкий спектр, и лишь небольшой отрезок<font
        color="#cccccc"> (все отрезки были идентичных размеров и
        окрасов)</font> радугой представлял видимую часть спектра. К
      сожалению, успел заснять лишь зашедшее солнце, но вероятно мой
      телефон не взял бы такую чёткую картинку, тем более против солнца.

      as you can see, the sky itself is also a rainbow: it goes from red
      to blue with some lack of green, and yellow is only in the clouds,
      I'm not sure it counts, it could be just some red and blue which
      are just on spectre, but are not of spectral nature.<br>
      Either way, I will find some good optics and will film it, I think
      I will contact some profession photographer tomorrow, or even two.

      I hope I will deliver soon in language thing with that a-b, a-d,
      when I literally divided words by meaningless letters. So vowel is
      no, and consonant is yes? consonants are different: b is in, d is
      off (de)<br>
      but something, vowels are just connecting voice, and probably
      first consonants were meaningful and vowels were just melodical.
      And later they began to use vowels as negation, but it probably
      grew out of <font color="#cccccc">interjunctions </font>interjections

      Something similar to what I observe around the light source is
      Brocken Spectre, but what I observe has nothing to do with water,
      it can be seen in absolutely dry room, photos are yet to come, but
      here what I could find so far:<br>

      That pink part is called Belt of Venus, and the blue beneath it is
      the shadow of the Earth.<br>
      But the phenomenon I want to discover even more is the way some
      tiny light source behaves in a dark room or a plane: when you
      raise your hand between your eyes and the source, the light is
      closed from the opposite direction, I wonder if it has something
      to do with camera obscura flipping the image or is it some glitch
      in the matrix. I will write more about it when I know more about
      it.<br>
      <br>
      So my guess is what?<br>
      tthere are several:<br>
      <br>
      Because light is of wave nature, that wave has some spectre and
      thus makes rainbow? <br>
      But sound is a wave and it may keep the same tone. Sun also as any
      star has it's <br>
      That word rainbow I use all the time is not the phenomenon of
      rainbow we kow, but more wide concept of iridescence. I'm not even
      sure this term is correct, so I simply say rainbow, so everybody
      knows what sequence of colours I am speaking of.<br>
      Either way, this topic is its deception, and I will deliver on it
      more coherent and legible.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      New thing I found today is that word "sweet!" may sound as sucking
      something up, like a noodle or with a straw, almost a kiss.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      All the story is written down. But it is written one piece at a
      time at some place.<br>
      Aum is only known to europeans as omen, in plural. Aum is one
      sound, not three, it's a nasal A.<br>
      An. One. <br>
      A is potentially nasal, and maybe that's the route some people
      pronounce it as O<br>
      Some nations pronounce pot with o, and others use [a] instead.
      Americans do, and that other channel I've shown you tell that it's
      more ancient form of english:<br>
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p_BFdOjZVE<br>
      or<br>
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRrsSPddg6A<br>
      and it's in russian.<br>
      here is where he tells that americans read o as a:
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56qwv_Jcg3c<br>
      <br>
      And watching that previous video, where he tells that hot dog is
      somewhere pronounced as hat dog, and before that cot and caught is
      compared, and both are a's, and it comes to me that o and u are
      just variants of <i>a</i>. <br>
      a is the full form, and o and u are underdrawn.<br>
      And because double a is o in dannish, <br>
      And bornholm runes are dannish, and there o is ᚮ the double ᛆ the
      a, and aa is o too.<br>
      o is pure a, the golden middle between <i>a</i> and <i>u</i> <br>
      u is oo, so it's a, aa=o, oo=u<br>
      o is in the middle. A is a cool way to pronounce it. It was the
      same, Om, Aum aUm it also was some accord, согласованное
      последовательное движение звука по спектру как радука.<br>
      Радуга is not alphabetic, otherwise imagine how extatic I would
      be, Would I? Raduga have some transparent etymology, but then you
      have to recognize that russians built pyramids? Or at leasgt that
      russians worshipped Rah. Rah-shins (shin is humans? 神 is shen, god
      in chinese. in japanese it's shin.<br>
      清 is shin in japanese, qing dinasty of china, where it's also
      clear, clean, distinct, quiet, thoroughly, completely, and it
      sounds like chin, that how chinese transliteration of qing is
      read.<br>
      心 is shin in japanese, xin in chinese, sounds as schin (щинь) and
      as japanese didn't destinguish x from q, so is both words are
      written as しん in hiragana. Weird transliterations of x and q was
      from portuguese and who knows who else, so I think, but who knows
      if it's true. Because they didn't have russian щ. That is
      palatalized sh, which is x. but q is ch. And it reminds me of
      gothic alphabet:<br>

      <br>
      as you can see, in comparison to lating it has some letters
      lacking strokes at the top: R looks like K, <br>
      B looks like upsided down R, D lacks part of the stroke, Q of 6
      and Q of 90 lack a stroke at the top, and that makes it remind Ч,
      as that q sounds in chinese, which I discuss above.<br>
      What's going on? I didn't change the масштаб, but letters seem to
      be tinier, and they're in the same font. Is it another example of
      world shrinking and we getting used to it and then we croak, I
      thought there was some term closer to shrink, but it seems google
      translator get worse: it doesn't know скопытиться, but mistake it
      for скопить или скопиться.<br>
      And then I kind of get used to this font and it looks normal. But
      that font at the front line seems smaller because it's compared to
      the similar (but slightly larger) font above it, in the image.<br>
      <br>
      Notice, how gothic p reminds u standing before it, and very
      similar to ᚢ.<br>

      vowels bowels? vow is bow? I didn't expect bowels here, I only

      <br>
      bow is not only a gesture of reverence, but also a weapon. and
      that weapon bow did use bowels as its string and a gut called
      catgut (though it's usually made of sheep's gut) is used in
      musical instrument which is played with some other bow, the
      fiddle-bow (fiddlestick is rememed by some comix creature) but
      that bow the fiddle bow uses hair instead of guts, so they play
      with horse hair against sheep guts. And that is very pleasant to
      them. It's very pleasant to me too, I think I've shown you this

      Today I managed to take the photos of the setting sun, but I
      didn't see the rainbow rays rayin'bows? either way, but mostly
      because I was focused on the phone. photos, phone.. it was not
      together at first, it is funny, because now they are. So the most
      rainbowish rays are on this one, and they're not very rainbowish,
      not very iridescent. Either way, the experiment was not pure
      because of the clouds above the sun, but there was no or almost no
      clouds directly at the sun:<br>

      but most of the time the sun itself was iridescent: redish
      orangish periphery, yellowish greenish closer to the sun and some
      pale blue in the centre. Is it the closest to the white because
      it's the most radiant, the most powerful part of the spectrum, so
      we're taught that sun is mostly ultraviolet? But that is not blue
      but grey, it only looks blueish against that yellow.<br>

      first Б was the head of the hourse. Then A became that, but
      probably in different places they came at different time the
      tradition and the change in the writing system. Is it why
      georgians call daddy baba and mommy dada?<br>
      <br>
      un of under as под is seen in по standing for on. and because п

      maybe on was up, the inhaling form of the same по?<br>

      under and под are literally cognates? panda? manda! and suddenly I
      see манда as M(other) underneath.<br>

      neath is translated as под for the sake of translators, not to
      make it obvious that neath has a cognate низ and yet in georgian
      it is translated with a cognate, I wonder if for the sake of
      translator or because they use it like them: <br>

      if s in south is a prefix to the common юг, then is s in север
      also such a prefix? without it it's ever, and that could be the
      name of the polar star. But astronomy tells that it was not the
      polar star all the time. But I doubt it.&nbsp; But either way, for
      the last 4000 years the north pole of the sky is in the three
      dippers of ursae and drago. ursae are female (at least in russian)
      and drago is lingual and probably male (in russian it is) and
      medveditsa are pretty labial in the beginning of the pairs o its
      name: mad and wit (and what if this is the actual etymology? What
      if maed used to make us mad? Because we found some ancient hives
      of tons of high-pressured honey? What if we found where bees lived
      for centuries and we don't know of such places anymoe, because
      they all were robbed millenia ago. since then not only the trees
      are tiny in comparison to what we used to have, but also the hives
      are usually one-year old.<br>
      <br>
      But I have to prove that honey by itself may become intoxicating.
      Lots of honey with the top of the hive broken off by a bear or a
      man can collect rainwater and come through whatever processes turn
      honey into maed. so russian medved for a bear could be not of that
      he knows where the honey is (why would we care) but that it's
      crazy and smart. or mad and wait? or mad and bad? Sometimes "bad"
      is used for something smart, like in badass, it is not something
      bad, it's something awesom, everything good is bad and everything
      bad is good. What if that is a ritual song testifying that the
      semantic of those words was changed by some supersticion maybe?<br>

      Это всё к слову юг, который как-то не явно связан с солнцем: юг
      [jug] and jug [жуг, что ближе всего к жёг] jug банка? х.з. может
      это линзой было изначально, и банки из стекла линзами назывались?
      jar is not necessarily a jug. but they could be cognates, some
      dialectal form of similar things by similar words unified by being
      accepted by both dialects and further into some standard.<br>
      штандард значит знамя, стандарт как знамение? как знание!<br>
      not ever art is kunde, but standing art is standard, the way
      others may repeat and be satisfied. And orthographic norm of d
      instead of t was made whether to avoid the homonymity or to
      conceal the cognatism. And whether the will was good or bad, <br>
      whether is of weather (it is something the future depends on: good
      weather I come, bad weather I won't could be further simplified to
      whether I come or not. whether here is good whether, по году. and
      or then would be the short form of other. other is not there?
      other is not they, not their: others are not theirs.<br>
      Initial vowel is always a no? What is I in Initial? не = мне. не =
      me.. I said it before, but in this context it's great.<br>
      <br>
      Let's begin the dictionary of cognates, or rather let's call it..<br>
      <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="cognates.html"><font
          color="#33ff33">mnemonic dictionary</font></a><br>
      <font color="#cccccc">not to be blamed for arbitrary etymologies
        just because they help to learn foreign words.</font><br>
      <br>
      under = not над.<br>
      под = fu at? (fu = no, today is only seen in some interjection of
      similar semantic, but actually its' a chinese word, and that's why
      is seen as slang, net exactly integrated in the body of the
      language with some grammatic forms, but maybe фуёвый это от того
      же самого фу. фу = хуй? по смыслу тоже может сповпадать (хуй может
      заменять слово нет, но никогда не значит слова да)<br>
      Итак, я добрался до самого мяса. Добавлять это хуй в
      русско-китайский словарь когнатов? Нет, погодю, я разведу его по
      языкам, и может тогда туда это добавлю в русско-китайскую часть.<br>

      north not moving? nor the, <font color="#cccccc">then </font>the
      nor.<br>
      also ursae make nutsy swastika by their movement through the sky
      and nothern sky rotates counter-clockwise. Also because sun is
      generally down there at the south up here.<br>

      and you can see that when they look at south, it goes pretty much
      clockwise,<br>
      and that is a simplest proof of the earth being spheric, the way
      pole on the south rotates clockwise:<br>

      So southern sky rotating clockwise and northern sky rotating
      counter-clockwise is sorta uniersal rule, only in the northern
      hemisphere south is where the sun is, and thus sun and south could
      be related words.<br>
