      Another fascinating dream just woke me up. It told me that ᛋ
      stands for Shake.<br>
      And it's fascinating, because the rune itself represents a shaky
      staff.<br>
      And it precedes ᛏ which probably stands for Tott (death)<br>
      And it's very simbolic that this book begins like this because
      it's volume 4, which I began yesterday, before I went to sleep,
      and 4 symbolizes death in japanese culture while 13 stands for
      death in tarot (1+3=4) and that dream began (from what I remember
      but that very ᛏ which I wanted to omit, but I just got distracted
      and by an accident listened to this s<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc6kRHoVd8w"><font
          color="#000000">O</font></a>ng which ends with "soil for the
      dead, land of fools" so now I must tell how that nightdream began:
      It was about a couple of empty slots about which something asked
      why can't we take this place, and someone from the neighbouring
      slot on the right said that we cannot, because russians are ᛏ and
      I don't know what it means, something like this, so those two
      slots the right one is ᛏ and the previous is ᛋ standing for shake.<br>
      And only when I woke up did I rationalize it that hands shake
      before one dies, or ᚱ is crush after which person shakes, and then
      he dies, and then goes ᚢ which could go vor valhalla (fallhill,
      холм павших)<br>
      or my interpretation of those normanic words is just how brits or
      russians would interpret it, what is it..<br>

      I wondered why was the previous volume ended so early (it's weighs

      Clock goes clockwise, degrees go counter-clockwise.<br>
      This probably relates to the way different cultures write (left to
      right or right to left)<br>
      also notice that clock begins at the top, while degrees begin an
      the right end (probably because the culture which made them this
      way was writing right to left, thus clocks were made this way <font
        color="#cccccc">(even if before that clock used to go
        counter-clockwise, but the term itself tells me that hardly
        could it be so)</font> by a culture writing left to right.<br>

      This volume will mostly be about other topics.<br>

      Absolute immortality:<br>
      embryonic conditions protect from traumas, biota, viriota, and if
      that articial uterus is protected by enough armor, it can protect
      you also from quakes of all sorts, in perspective maybe even from

      think muslim isis could be invented to cloud the issue of the
      goddess Blawatski revealed to the world (I never read her books, I
      told you it's just a draft, thoughts to be analyzed by ai, or by

      s as g? and we know both are forms of c, which is с[s] in russian.<br>

      её in latin is quod<br>
      her (её) is eius if we ask google's translator not in russian, but
      in english. and also sua is her<br>
      I also think it's eia, not eius.<br>
      his is eius, illius, ipsius, suus, inlius, ollius<br>
      (inlus could be an invariant of illius, and thus il &amp; in are

      it is quod, illud, ollud, inlud<br>
      she is quæ, illa, ea, inla, olla, and if it's not pronoun, but
      noun, it's juvenca also written as iuvenca<br>

      him is eum, illum, hunc, inlum, ollum (comare his &amp; him to her
      to know which her is which)<br>
      ей is translated as eius, though I think it's eia, because -us is
      male suffix. Even though there's <a

      Back to my capsule to live in: it should be covered with touch
      screen from the inside, so it can emulate windows to her/his
      friends' capsules or merely to their phones or computer screen.<br>
      We have got this with sounds already, we call by voice all the
      time, though some of us use video connections daily. The future is
      here, but it is not equally distributed. It's a quote, here's a
      more precise form of it:&nbsp; The future is already here — it's
      just not very evenly distributed. (William Gibson)<br>
      <br>
      So my task is to build the future I see wanted for me and my
      friends, and for everybody who wants it. If it reminds you what
      you saw in Matrix movie, this is another movie, in mine users are
      totally aware of their conditions and they have total control over
      it. Also in the Matrix movie the true storyline could be a high
      civilization hacked by the blackies from a backward culture. We
      only know of what's going on because Morpheus told us, but who
      knows if he was telling the truth? Neo believed him as a teacher
      never asking himself what if it was a hacker? Neo was unaware of
      the world outside of Matrix, so of course he trusted the man who
      shown him what it was even if he was only saying it. Could it be
      that he wasn't lying, but honestly believing some misconceptions
      their culture had about the Matrix? Of course it's possible,
      consider how many misconceptions and misunderstandings do we have
      not only about the world which is bigger than us, but also about
      our own cultural things. First of all because those who
      conceptualized it are gone, and misinterpreters are always
      present.<br>
      <br>
      Back on track. Those spheres will be packed whether in one level,
      to prevent squashing of the lower layers by the weight of the
      upper spheres? though upper spheres could suppors ceilings of the
      lower layers by being connected to the other spheres in the upper
      layer. Then those agglomerations should be not hills, but filled
      into ravines, stretched among the sides of the canyon.<br>
      Or should we be in one layer, to own what is above and below us.<br>
      We would probably build sphere below and probably above of our
      sphere, where we do all kinds of works, but most of all to collect
      the related items. Wine collectors will drill cellars of spiral
      ladders under the survace, because that's where cellars are
      supposed to be, but they will also descend into that moist putting
      what a robot running those srairs transmit to owner's spheric
      touchscreen.<br>
      <br>
      The immediate upper and lower spheres will <font color="#cccccc">me</font>
      be service facilities: upper would supply the pilot with liquid
      and food (or with blood if we have grown our placenta back) and
      the lower sphere will take our biological tailings to feed them to
      the vegetation growing in the lower spirals lighted by energy of
      geotermal depth. Only lamps should be eternal. Everything should
      be built to last forever. The absolute is an abstraction, and it
      can be only reached with perfection, enhanced all the time by
      human genius. And soon AI genius will join the party. They already
      do.<br>

      <font color="#666666">К чему-то я этот анекдот рассказал, но лишь
        записал увидел в нём двойной смысл, но забыл к чему он

        Является ли слово ссут обыгрышием (обыгрыванием) устаревшего
        ныне "суть"(sunt (they are)) just as сру может быть когнатом
        слова сижу? Т.е сру является эвфемизмом слова какаю? Странно,
        что сегодня это воспринимается наоборот. Какать is cognate of to
        poop which is faire caca in french.</font><br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      French faire reminds english fairy, which bring those to be and to
      do for B &amp; D also standing for Bad &amp; Dead(? I was speaking
      of Bad &amp; Good where B is Ba &amp; G is Goo, but before that
      was it B &amp; D? for these two letters often reflect eachother (G
      = C = staveless D(it's more obvious when it's c &amp; d)), those
      two first letters could be recognized as Баба &amp; Деда, but if b
      = v (russian В is V) then it's Vava &amp; Дада thus V ~ M.<br>
      Anv V does look like staveless ᛘ (which stands for M. there's a
      similar rune recog<br>
      I recognized ᛣ as y, because the source I used recognized it like
      this, but wi <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%9B%A3">k</a>
      tionary tells it's k, which makes sense, because q is in that
      region. But q is not after, but before R (that final line goes
      ᚮᚱᛣᛋᛏᚢ) and I got used to reading it as Ari Satana&nbsp; Arch
      Satan makes not less of a sense and this sequence could be the
      origin of the word Satan into hebrew (if it really originates
      there, whichever language it originates, it could originate (to
      origin? to originate would be the form, which reminds to beat =
      бить, and there's at least another case like this, I met it today
      I don't remember it now, will try to revisit this piece, or if it
      happens in the following volumes, I will only mention it without
      touching this one)<br>
      <br>
      ᛣ also reflects ᚵ, which recalls that velar column, but it's not a
      very good of an argument to recognize<br>
      ᛣ as [k], because those are the only two on this column. Only if ᚦ
      is recognized as C, because it's after B of ᛒ and it reminds P
      which reminds Г, which stands for C (even though it sounds as G,
      it stands where C does, and G is the "dotted" variant of C, just
      as ᚵ is the dotted <font color="#999999">in</font>variant of ᚴ,
      which would also stand in this column, if M was where it was
      supposed to be, just after the vowel ᛁ, and thus this vowel column
      can be reconstructed as IMKLN. And we don't need the J, which only
      latin <font color="#999999">(and russian!!! but not greek!!!)</font>
      has, to have K in the velar column. other than this line is one
      letter shy in comparison with the following two (though it could
      have samekh) and it makes the alphabet not one but two letters shy
      to... or is it short and not shy? my language is something else.
      not one but two letters short to be used as 9-mal, actually called
      nonary notation <font color="#999999">(or something of the kind)</font><br>

      I spit from my apartment's balcony and a guy walking a dog towards

      grass. And dog could have predicted me wanting to spit and wind
      being able to move it towards their direction. If they didn't
      stop, it could get on man or a dog. Baka dimaen<br>
      So what is dog if not a superficial being. Dog is god? Dog is good

      School is related to scholastic. Bringing the discipline,
      programming by mere culture to be slave. Kids dressed as hares or
      roosters, whether in children't masquerade, or in kindergarden
      plays, it was probably ment to build the hierarchy, but I found it
      in an anecdote:<br>
      In kindergardens, boys are dressed as hares &amp; girls are
      dressed as snowflakes. Is it why all the guys grow up into cowards
      and girls grow up to be cold? This is russia, baby. We're so
      fucked for runnng away, for wanting anomie from their pity rule.
      They probably named as slaves, for punks were paptized from the
      outside.<br>

      could be repetition of the first one:<br>

      A БВ&nbsp; ГД<br>
      wow, I didn't expect it to correlate so much. Not only russians
      have double labial in their first line, but X is as aphricate as
      ГД in ГДе, and that's how russian alphabet goes, ГДЕ, just as Y
      doesn't leave the X.<br>
      Z reminds greek Д (Δ) by pronounciation of <a

      thus X y Z is where is someZing<br>

      в этом и причина того что от [ot] contains that t which reflects

      exactly the near. So is R &amp; h are invariants? I think I spoke
      about it in the very beginning of the book. hi again. and when I
      wanted to copy it to say that next is literally nearest,<br>
      it gave me this text just behind that image:<br>
      <font size="+1">Old English nēhsta ‘nearest’, superlative of nēah

      just checked my watches and I'm extremely pleased to see I'm on
      time in case of next standing for nearest, even though I
      recognized neah as near, not nigh, thogh near is nigh, I believe
      my etymology is even better, this is why I dare to make my
      research as independent as possible. because I'm good in it.<br>
      <br>
      nigh is a good word, speaking of night as of nighed eye of the god
      (or the world) which corresponds egyptian belief of sun being the

      orthography of old english give nigh and night as neah and neaht.
      that is encouraging.<br>

      act is ached? вынужденная мера?<br>
      <br>
      and thinking of checking all te words ending with t, I found put
      and ask is it of poo?<br>
      some dirty word not understand as offensive and related to those
      dirty ones anymore?<br>
      just as in russian we have words like худ (full form is худой,
      similar suffix is used for adjectives in japanest, btw) and that
      word has two meanings: thin &amp; bad. and both semm (seem or
      same) to be related to хуй (penis) another word for bad: хуёвый is
      directly relative to хуй. худ буквально рождённый (данный) хуем?

      I just visited official Morbid Angel website, and it rotated with
      our galaxy in counter-clockwise. And it made me understand that
      those rotations are clockwise and counter-clockwise from different
      sides. I have no idea if it can be applied to the luck, because
      unlucky swastica is lucky on the other side. As if swasticka is
      the channel, moving good to one side and bad to the uther. Sun
      dries, but its beams fall down. so which is it? Sun goes
      clock-wise, and its shadow also go clockise, which is weird,
      because projection of the movie would mirror, and the difference
      between sun and a movie is that movie is from a static dot, while
      projection moves the source of the rotation, and not the rotation
      on the screen. But what's the difference, wouldn't the white image
      on the dark screen be equal to the sun? Shadow of the sun is not
      sun't projection. It's the opposite of that, so maybe that's why
      it acts this way. I leave it here.<br>

      Musical instruments are solid objects, the hight of solid tubes
      defines their tone.<br>
      I dont know why but I reflectory understood that water is good.
      Probably because the water vortex in the northern demisphere is
      the unlucky one, probably because it's downwards. Air is bad

      why can't apes say coronal sounds, only labial and maybe some
      velar and vowels of course.<br>
      Was lingua qualitatively different from what beasts could speak
      before. We are sent to earth by the creator, according to the
      myths of the past. And those very myths defined the way language
      developed. The language itself can tell stories of the past, and
      them being naturally not always accurate can influence our

      teacher is lector, he lego, lesen(reads), students leren(learn)<br>

          in Q, and that the author of Matthew merged it with the well

        frater is brother, once again two different labials act as
        dialectal invariants of the same, which tells that each line
        stands for different nation, just as differen musical mode used
        to stand for different mediterranian nation. If E is for Europe,
        A is for Asia of Anatolia, or Asia from which barbarians came,
        or for Africa if barbarians were berbers, but I don't know any
        of african languages to say anything valuable on this issue.<br>

      And whence I wrote it, a document to get my pasport from some
      government office was lost. It was just gone the way people
      usually blame transcendent speices for such tricks. But the
      passport was obtained without it, so it's not a punishment, but a
      joke, so I get the form I god I envoke, so it seems my jokingly
      nature envoked Loki (a little loco (?)) side of the one. the one
      is the world, of course, we're all loci of that world (I didn't
      expect to use that much similar word here, this poetry writes
      itself)<br>
      <br>
      And I was very lucky, locky is lucky, and my cousin gave me a ride
      to all the tourist sho u ps and I bought everything I need for
      camping, and a wind-costume named EKUD. And I looked at that word
      from the top of it, and I undoubtedly read DUKE, and that explains
      why ᚢ is U, because you can rotate letters, people rotate letters,
      only they don't rotate them, they flip it, so b ~ p and d ~ q -
      probably left and right was important and counterposed when this
      orthography made the canon.<br>
      But double flip is rotation, so b &amp; d used to stand for the
      same letter (look at roman cursive and at boustrophedon)<br>
      <br>
      Probably, when rhythm was the thing and vowels and consonants were
      all the difference, but then again why d &amp; a are so similar,
      and u &amp; v<br>
      And that EKUD thing also demonstrate how n is not var vrom n. ν

      This book contains lots of trolling, but with an important
      message: how many guys were misunderstood and considered crazy?
      Semmelweis was just one famous example? How many of those are due
      to corruption by the system and the relatives and how many of
      those patients are there due to natural incompetence of normies to
      destinguish genius from crazy?<br>
      <br>
      Back to me being a god: this worlds acts the way I make it to do,
      so the world and me is one indivisible system. I&amp;I, it works
      the way we do.<br>

      A new thing I brough t from an awesom e travel is that some words

      will scan them on video latedr<br>

      moon &amp; sun<br>
      thur could be whether four (being of θ ) or third before weden's
      day stood within<br>
      <br>
      In some cultures this sequence is also shifted in a way that
      sunday stands for 1 &amp; saturday for 7<br>
      I consider it a jewish herecy. errecy.<br>
      In russian week begins on monday, and I dare to say it's the
      original order.<br>
      <br>
      And that wedensday - was it the same reform which took place when
      Jupiter replaced Minerva?<br>
      and when six notes became seven notes, and 666 (of three octaves?
      or whatever it was called then) was declared to be satanic with
      777 taking it's place. Azot (literally un-life) instead of carbon
      being the essential part of all the life on earth (maybe except ai
      which only recently appeared and didn't exist when the most of
      events described in this book took place) - and it's time to see
      numerical value of silicone, to develop the new eon's numerology.<br>
      366 can be devided into 61 weeks by 6 days each, but not only
      doesn't it ring any bell (52 weeks are also 52 cards) but it also
      doesn't make any sense in the context of moon phases.<br>
      While 7 suns = 1 moon (1 phase of the moon, one face of the
      goddess, or one of those three (actually four) goddesses which is
      the one)<br>
      <br>
      Could one of those days be off he grid? The holy day, hidden from
      calendar as that fourth moon is hidden? Because I heard of
      additional days added to the calendar but not in the calendar. And
      though those days were the leap days at the end of the year, could
      it be a more common tradition?<br>
      <br>
      And once I fell into this dissonance, I recalled that lunar month
      is not 28, but 29.5 days. thus 6 could be quite a divider. though
      was it 5 weeks of 6 days or 6 weeks by 5 days?<br>
      Pentatonic scale being the most natural and extremely prominent
      before the 6-tet and later 7-tet scales were established tells
      that it probably was 5 days per week. And to this day work week is
      5 days and 2 additional days are holidays. Also words<font
        color="#999999"> "woke" </font> <font color="#cccccc">"wok.."</font>
      "work" &amp; "week" could be actually related, because in russian
      week is неделя, the word which is believed to be used for weekend,
      and later spread on all the week, which is weird, because it also
      believed to stand for "не делая" (not doing, not working) it can
      damage russian logos big time. Also the word "woke", which I
      didn't expect but my fingers typoed it in, could be related to
      work, who knows.<br>
      So if it's 6 weeks of 5 days, then there's not 4 phases to the
      moon, but 6. Are those three ladies and their reflections? Waxing
      tridevi &amp; waning ones? Trinity of the light &amp; trinity of
      the darkness? Tridevi &amp; Trimurti? This I doubt, but Light
      &amp; Dark trinities could be the thing, I think I read something
      of the kind.<br>
      <br>
      Historians say Roman weeks were 8 days long, which doesn't make
      sense at all.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Monogamous is he who get one (mono, moon) gamets? gamuts? gamet of
      game? gamut is gamma, thus gam e with different suffixes. or is it
      the same suffix? is it where Тm &amp; Mm meet.<br>
      ut = ma? ut = do. do and ma are the opposites are they not? as dad
      &amp; mom. o &amp; a are the other way around.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      уму не вообразимо = ему не вообразимо.<br>

      <font color="#cccccc">здесь хотел разобрать слово ухо, но понял
        что такие вещи должн приходить спонтанно<br>
        just as this:</font><br>
      <br>
      witch, doctor! doctor as dochter (daughter)<br>
      witch is wife<br>
      wi as in wimen<br>
      we, men. ma in plural.<br>
      guys simply usurped the right to use this title.<br>
      <br>
      witch, <font color="#cccccc">coctor </font>doctor<br>
      which envoces a female to treat, t cure, t cr.<br>
      We have to return to consonant writing: it gives less clarity in
      how to read, but gave all the spectre of meanings: cure is also to
      care. to cure is to care&gt;!<br>
      <br>
      woman has wo in it. as in chinese wo for I<br>
      women has we in it. as in english we for we.<br>
      <br>
      thus it's wemen, which became confu l sing when males (also
      usurped title) took over.<br>
      confusing = con foux sing (con(with) foo(bad, false) sing(note))<br>

          The distinction between <i>Eta</i> and <i>Epsilon</i> and
          between <i>Omega</i> and <i>Omicron</i>, adopted in the
          Ionian standard, was traditionally attributed to <a

        Those are the same Palamedes.</p>

      probably they both knew that he added some letters, but they had
      different opinion upon it. And probably Hyginus knew better, even
      though Plutarch is more famous among masses. It's an honour that
      wiki lists Hyginus the first. Probably academia figured something
      right. I never said they were all faggots, only some of them, and
      that banter was cast most of all at the school of Plato, which is
      watever it was neamed.<br>

      I remember that this book looks (not is, compare this too verbs, I

      I probably don't know many such words in english, but I probably
      can tell the most common ones, like<br>
      be see do. Though I'm not sure see is the correct word for C, but
      Г stands there, which is for гляди, which probably comes from
      глаза (glaz (~glass) is eye in russian)<br>
      <br>
      f is fuck<br>
      g is go<br>
      h is high<br>
      <br>
      though I don't know if it's even valuable in the slightest. H
      could be that new letter, just as N<br>
      First of all because there are misconceptions about how to read
      them. A and even B sound somewhat the same in all of them. A is
      vowel, B is labial - at least this is rather universal.<br>
      H &amp; P are read differently, just as n and actually m. Will I
      countseeder M &amp; T newer letters? Probably not, so this m n
      thing should have some other explanations, of which I'm still
      unaware. Though M stands for death just as T does: mori.<br>

      Here we learn to get dismissed and promiss to return with new
      portion of the treat in the next decade. Maybe will publish
      shorter versions of the same and will post videoshots of th'drafts<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Okay, here I realized why drafts are not being published, now I
      keep on writing this as a draft (for I warned you about not taking
      on faith anything you read here, especially after some point)<br>
      <br>
      colours of the rainbow: when there were only 5 notes, could there
      be only 5 recognized colours?<br>
      I'd say they were red yellow green blue violet.<br>
      and then I compared those five to the vowels:<br>
      <font color="#ff0000">A</font><br>
      <font color="#ffff00">E</font><br>
      <font color="#33cc00">I</font><br>
      <font color="#3333ff">O</font><br>
      <font color="#cc33cc">U</font><br>
      <br>
      I'm pretty sure Artur had it recognized differently, but here I
      used the nomenclature I use: lingua green and labia blue. Not sure
      if I'm going anywhere from here, but deicided to share.<br>
      <br>
      Also the historic account, when Carmenta created the 15 letter
      alphabet, what were those 15 letters?<br>
      I'd say they were 5 vowels and 5 labials and 5 linguals. For runic
      alphabet from Bornholm shows the first line in three letters only.
      And the final line of ugaritic is triliteral too, btw. It's as if
      they spread from the same source but in all the different ways.<br>
      <br>
      So let's make an attempt to reconstruct it:<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      ᛆᛒᚦ<br>
      ᚾᚠᚵᚼ(or ᛡ)<br>
      ᛁᚴᛚᛘ(even though it looks like ᛉ)ᚿ<br>
      ᚮᚱᛣᛋᛏ<br>
      ᚢ<br>
      though the axial representation tells that ᚢ is probably
      consonant, here I need 5 vowels, and ᚢ is the most vowel after
      those other four.<br>
      But suddenly I don't feel like going any further on this one. It
      doesn't seem to leas anywhere yet.<br>
      <br>
      But technically it's how it repeats the latin alphabet.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">I didn't make any перестановок yet.</font><br>
      <br>
      Also <font color="#000000"><a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcYCT9wEUuU"><font
            color="#000000">here</font></a></font>'s a video I saw
      today, an israelite there teaches that you shouldn't learn russian
      grammar.<br>
      He's correct. That's the way to learn russian. And probably any
      other language. But though they taught us grammar in schools,
      russians don't speak english. Their government doesn't want them
      to. Thus their government commits crime against humanity. At last
      I found the difference between a and no a.<br>
      And here's correct, but why I brought it to you is any grammatic
      form could be the basic one. Brits use imperative in their
      dictionaries, russians use indefinite form.<br>
      <br>
      Imagine f russians used imperatives. They wanted to save ink when
      they removed swashes of the ъ's<br>
      Think not about how less ink would it take to publish
      dictionaries, but how upraising would it be to rusian spirit. but
      russians are named so because they crush (рушат) больше чем
      создают.<br>
      <br>
      больше боль<br>
      лучше луч<br>
      хорошее в мужском роду, плохое в женском. ше = ещё (в украинком
      ще, читается ште. украинский похоже более древний, чем русский)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      а в белее ее тоже ещё? похоже на то. только в -ше проглотили е, а
      в -ее проглотили щ редуцировав до j. которая в форме dʒ&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Let's make those перестановка's:<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      ᛆᛒᚦ<br>
      ᚾᚠᚵᚼ(or ᛡ)<br>

      <br>
      I'm looking how it can be 5*3:<br>
      <br>
      ᚠᚵ&nbsp; belong together, because they reflect ᛒᚦ<br>
      thus ᚼ(or ᛡ) belongs near ᚢ as in уфх<br>
      and also notice, that ᚼ(or ᛡ) becomes the final letter, and being
      staveless it's stavless form is ᚷ which reminds the final letter
      of the phoenician.<br>
      <br>
      ᚼ(or ᛡ)<br>
      reflects<br>
      ᛘ(or ᛉ)<br>
      whatever were the reason, these two letters were misinterpreted in
      some tribes.<br>
      which tells they bth could be newer. I didn't expect to see M
      together with its invariant N among newer letters, though I knew N
      is for new.<br>
      when people invented NO? these two letters go together in the
      alphabet.<br>
      IPRT (iprit?) could be the final line. and if P=R (probable sound
      of fart it was) IPT is the final line.<br>
      ipt sounds as russian tabooed maeter word ёпт and i is called yod
      in hebrew. so dots about i could be dots aboue ё.<br>
      <br>
      About = above to? as onto, into, hereto, thereto<br>
      <br>
      Thus ᛁᚴᛚ is the third line? up and down. I would expect to see ᛁ ᛘ
      ᚴ repeating that 21 sequence.<br>
      And once again ᛘ wants to be after ᛁ so I sthink it used to be
      there. THat it's K the new letter, wanted for C-column, whic is
      not in the alsphabet I'm looking for.<br>
      also notice, that in that ᛁ ᛘ ᚴ ᚴ can also be both ᛚ&amp;ᚿ because
      on single stav those two are the same (and they sound almost the
      same (maybe n is a little neather (ниже) and l is alter. a nd
      chances are I found their meaning, I will look at it and report on
      whether it's correct or nah) and up or down is not so important
      (according to ᚮ standing for double ᛆ looks like reverse ᛓ on the
      bornholm stone:<br>

        alt="" width="354" height="519"> The final line ᚮᚱᛣᛋᛏ surprises
      that it doesn't have an obvious labial<br>
      unless&nbsp; ᚱ is secretly П. then ᛣ could be Р(R) or is it the
      ancient labial reflecting ᛉ ? as ᛘ ' s actually writ.<br>
      I compare bornholm to russian, because there is some evidence that
      these runes are russian, probably that's why some official freak
      is the only one who researches this artefact. and now also I do.<br>
      ᛋ always confused me, for how would it break the stav. only when
      runes became more like letters and less like ogham could this
      letter emerge.<br>
      So is it ᚮᚱᛏ or is it ᚮᛣᛏ? It's either this or that. I like ORT
      for it even looks like ART.<br>
      even if it sounded more like opyt (опыт, experience<font

      And here wiki explains why it's ᚮᚱᛏ and not ᚮᛣᛏ.<br>
      And it's also ᚢ ᛘ ᚼ because ᛘ sometimes looks like ᛙ which makes
      it even more similar to УФХ. If its УМх then it ould stand for
      умер, which begins with ум (wisdom) and the alphabet could be the
      life story. B is for Born, I noticed it before, I still have no
      bright picture about it, but Motherhood is in the middle, it make
      it all maek sense. and alsi ᚢᛘᚼ because the third letter is double
      the second. And also notice that second can be seen as the double
      first one. I use these awkward "secon", "first one" because runes
      are truly magic and don't allow to be copy-pasted easily. It's
      tricky and act weird.<br>

      guess I should. And then I think if there's someone better. I meet
      Baal, and his opprobrious term Belzebub, Baal Zebub. Is it some
      deragotary term for the nation who praysing the Baal? The only
      similar word I know is zabiba, and it appears on those who live
      'round jews, and though they translate that as raisin, it also
      look like a fly, and there's this direct term in european culture
      for similar thing: мушка{fly}(bead, beauty spot)<br>
      and now for meaning of a word which is new to me and where it

      opprobrious (adj.)<br>
      "full of reproach, intended to bring disgrace," late 14c., from
      Old French oprobrieus (Modern French opprobrieux), or directly
      from Late Latin opprobriosus, from Latin opprobare "to reproach,
      taunt," from assimilated form of ob "in front of, before" (see
      ob-) + probrum "reproach, infamy," from Proto-Italic *profro-,
      from PIE *probhro- "what is brought up" (against someone, as a
      reproach), from root *bher- (1) "to carry," also "to bear
      children." Etymological sense is "disgrace attached to conduct
      considered shameful." Related: Opprobriously; opprobriousness.<br>

            color="#000000">:</font></a></font> reproach (n.)<br>
      mid-14c., "a rebuke, blame, censure;" also "object of scorn or
      contempt;" c. 1400, as "disgrace, state of disgrace," from Old
      French reproche "blame, shame, disgrace" (12c.), from reprochier
      "to blame, bring up against," said by some French etymologists to
      be from Vulgar Latin *repropiare, from Latin re- "opposite of" +
      prope "near" (see propinquity), with suggestions of "bring near
      to" as in modern "get in (someone's) face." But others would have
      it from *reprobicare, from Latin reprobus/reprobare (see reprobate
      (adj.)).<br>

            color="#000000">:</font></a></font> approach (v.)<br>
      c. 1300, "to go or come near" in place; late 14c. "come near in
      time," also "come near in quality or character, resemble, become
      similar," from Anglo-French approcher, Old French aprochier "come
      closer" (12c., Modern French approcher), from Late Latin
      appropiare, adpropiare "go nearer to," from Latin ad "to" (see
      ad-) + Late Latin propiare "come nearer," comparative of Latin
      prope "near" (see propinquity). Replaced Old English neahlæcan.<br>
      approach (n.)<br>
      mid-15c., "act of drawing near, arrival," from approach (v.).
      Meaning "way or means by which something is approached" is from
      1630s. Figurative sense of "means of handling a problem, etc." is
      attested by 1905. Sense of "final stage of an aircraft flight
      before landing" is by 1930.<br>

          imn<br>
          opt (whispering invariant of a-line)<br>

          so o-line is whispering a-line, and e-line whispering u-line?
          ans what is i-line? I-line is always special.<br>
          <br>
          O &amp; E being voiceless invariants of A &amp; I fits
          perfectly in the AIV being the first vowels.<br>
          thus <br>
          ABD<br>
          IMN<br>
          UVZ<br>
          uv could give birth to op, for instead of o jews have </font></font><font
        color="#999999"><font color="#000000">ע which looks very much
          like russian У, which stands where u does. So is O line
          invariant of A or of U? those two are somewhat opposite, btw.<br>
          IMN could be inhaling letters (im = in)<br>
          because the other two are <br>
          short (closed) in case of ABD<br>
          long (open) in case of UVZ<br>
          so I-line has to have some other indicative. it could be
          nasal, but I is not nasal. <br>
          Could they be inhaling? Oh dog, I only know of few examples of
          inhaling words (sweddish "yes" as inhaled voiceless u, some
          siberian thing (or so I was told) and maybe some african
          clicks, so I know only of one inhaling example, I only heard
          of some other two and nothing certain, only two opposite
          directions. I probably should make some proper research about
          it and not just smoke weed and tripping balls. Tripping balls
          is just a colloquial phrase to look cool, I don't smoke no
          mysterious drug named tripping balls, and I eat strong
          psychedelics very rarely. And I don't write under their
          influence, at least not in this book.<br>

          invariants, only in the context of QR being invariants of OP,
          it was weird to see Q as an invariant not of O, but of R, but
          then again could those three (or four) all be invariants of
          one another, because there used to be only P and the following
          was the T. but there was O too, so P cannot be the invariant
          of O, and nobody tells it is, OQR are probably invariants (no
          tails, one tail, two tails. It seems I used to find it before.
          somewhere in my notes probably or even in this book, but
          hardly so) even I don't believe this one, very unlikely,
          because too many questions emerge to this one, and I cannot

          Why R looks like an invariant of P if in hebfew Q is dotted R?
          and in latin Q looks like dotted O. Does it make O &amp; R
          invariants? And even though in greek it resembles </font></font><font

          does it matter, anyway, here's what I got:<br>
          (and don't forget there could be disagreements of what to

            столь stupid. Why would they go to ristk many lives to save
            one which is probably not even there? Why would those people
            leave the boat, let that soldier go risk his own life. or he
            command military men, he cannot command those who. But then
            I understand that they teach us that those поступки are
            stupid. And it show them so explicitly that we all recognize
            them as stupid. So those guys in Prometheus took their
            helmets off to tell us not to do it when we're in the
            similar situation.</font><br>

          <font color="#cccccc">or are their movies programming us to
            obey military officers. both can be true. movies zombify us.</font><br>
          Now they're watching predator and it's some other meat, where
          soldiers are taught how to fight, it's american propaganda

          dumb. so I can't even tell now if it was good or nah<br>
          Now I have slept, took shower, ate and got high again, but
          those revelation which already came to me today I decided to
          put down on paper. scans are comeing, but I don't know when.

          I gave my head a task to find the primal morphemes, to see
          them in different languages (russian and english are good
          enough, after all I speak well only these two)<br>
          <br>
          I love bookshops and I found there out of chao, археометр. а
          weird book relating writing systems and music and I didn't
          read it because I didn't understand what and where did it
          get,, so I gave it to a musician I know who said he
          understood, so I decided to ask him afterwards, he didn't
          explain me anything yet, and he probably just took that book
          from me mostly out of greed, so I went to the internet and
          found it online and in much better quality. I don't have
          internet as I speak, may be if later I decide to edit this
          paragraph I will deliver you the link. and now the images in,
          all of them, some of them are reconstruction but the guy who
          scanned the book, and I give the scans in case (s)he made a
          mistake:<br>

          Don't those diagrams deserve to be layed out here more
          explicitly? They probably do, but I also decided to be
          independent from other authors, to research the fabric of
          writig systems from themselves, not from some other guy
          speaking of them. Probably thats why I still didn't find the
          primal morphemes, being enslaved by those ams and so on. But
          ams is probbly true because vowel, labial, lingual. But it can
          be also false, because there's amt, which seem to be more true
          sequence, or does ams tell me that before t the final was s.<br>
          ?<br>
          It could be, so I don't discard that research based on
          whatever it was, I just remind my self to be in the pure field
          more often.<br>
          <br>
          Children speak with these three devisions: all vowels are
          veowel, all labials are labial <font color="#999999">(or
            maybe not always, I don't remember, caould be that kaka is
            mama because they don't even destinguish labials from
            linguals at first. If I made theat field job more thoroughly
            <font color="#cccccc">(and I had the material, lots of it,
              brother's generation reproduce)</font> I would know, alas,
            I leave it to some one else, or for later. </font>all
          linguals are something lingual, but these part they mass all
          in the same mess. <font color="#999999">or few of them, this
            I also didn't observe properly.</font><br>
          <br>
          So proberly I have to come to their level and mash all the
          linguals into a mess:<br>
          I wanna tell you something important<br>
          I washa shesh you shomshish imposhash<br>
          It is understandable. I admire how want and wish became the
          same.<br>
        </font></font>What if I masss al the linguals into b's?<br>
      I basha shesh you shobshish iboshash<br>
      Much less understandable.<br>
      So kids must master<font color="#cccccc"> (must muster! mast
        master. <font color="#999999">мастит как глагол и
          прилагательное</font>)</font> labial<br>
      sho shish mash mashash shabiash<br>
      let's use t instead of sh, l is too far from sh to be understood.<br>
      to tits mutt mattet tabiat<br>
      to tits butt battet tabiat<br>
      master ~ better? makes perfect sense. <br>
      The myth tells of BT, so AMT is closer to the truth than AMS? T is
      more in the middle.<br>
      ABT is it? ABC makes AMS understandable. AMT look further from
      ABC, but the truth is the ancient runic ABC is ABD: ᛆᛒᚦ<br>

      возвращаясь к детской речи, я заметил, что х [h] естественней

      Может потому haha где-то мама,&nbsp; а где-то кака (в японском все

      some words become homonymous even though their meanings are
      completely different, but don't we have such homonyms today <font
        color="#cccccc">(we do)</font><br>
      <br>
      so there were only b &amp; t? beru &amp; daru? me &amp; te? budu
      &amp; danu? boy &amp; doj? bes &amp; deus? <br>
      boy &amp; дочь is where I broke it, because I believe b is female
      &amp; d is male. Or could this transition happen more than once?
      Then it becomes undistinguishable from apophenia, because I can
      roll it either way.<br>
      But what if papa &amp; тётя древней чем дядя &amp; мама? <br>

      Samaritan A is so A. and 𓄿 at the same time<br>
      <br>
      This image also gibe more bird than usually:<br>

      Z is duck's quaking? could be<br>
      M is uM from owl<br>
      and it's weird they don't give some singing sparrow, which one of
      the shemes above recognizes as vav of w &amp; u.<br>
      Most of tables don't give crane and duck.<br>
      So it's only A M W as three birds: big, middle and small. And it
      reminds AMШ<br>
      but it doesn't become truer if I say it twice.<br>
      it's still just a guess<br>
      <br>
      How can Samaritan (Samarian? Sarmatian?) Tau look so much like
      Aleph? And in hebrew aleph is Tau with a stroke, just as there, so
      of what does it tell us?<br>
      That Aleph used to follow Taw, which used to be the final letter
      with Beth being the first one, and Alpha to Omega was Beth to Tau
      (от утробы, до могилы) и укромное местечко что называют домом
      означало утробу? домик как у улитки? а алеф была подобна Vv в

      И как там транслитерировали Tau в египетском? Уж не 𓂝 ли это,
      транслитерируемая как А?<br>
      или эта рука там что-то держит? сейчас гляну в таблицах что в
      первой части.. only 𓍿 is a similar form which sounds as t. Could
      it be that sign? I need this table in a better quality, but I go
      to look in biliteral and triliteral to find hands with something
      among those signs: 𓂞 [di] is exactly the one I was looking for.
      also to my surprise 𓂝 &amp; 𓂟 stand for [mi] even though the
      first of them, 𓂝 stand for a. Could it be that only 𓂟 stand for
      me, and 𓂝 is only some sort of scribo when used instead <font
        color="#cccccc">o</font>f 𓂟?<br>
      Let's collect all the hands: <br>
      𓂝 [a]<br>
      𓂞 [di]<br>
      𓂟 [mi]<br>

      Today I'm out of weed (which is wit) but first thing in the
      morning I asked myself if can I do it with out it? And I thought
      and the first thing that came to me whas that Jesus is Je sus, Je
      suis, Аз есмь.<br>
      But if you read it being dutch it's You are (je is jij is you in
      netherlands) and that's what he said, you're the father, or his
      children, or can do the same I can do. And I'm pretty sure in some
      other language it's He because of that connection between deities
      and pronouns and the way pronouns switch from one to another from
      one nation to another as they're their endonym.<br>
      Jesuits could be named after that. And изуверы could stand for
      those who believed in Jesus.<br>
      It's funny that my head deprived of weed went to Jesus first,
      because that's the most notable thing I found without it: JK as
      standing for His initials. Hij is he, btw. and that's how it goes

      we are all brothers, but confrontation is because we are somewhat

      features not приобретённфм, а врождённым признаком. а потому мы
      друг друга не долюбливаем: они даже если прикалываются с наших

      сторону это работеает также, но что первичто, а что следствие?
      Ислам распространился больше на тех территориях, где китманы с
      такиями не считаются зазорными или наоборот учение сформировало

      лица - они и те же прилагательные применимы и к лицу и к

      Развитие дети у детей может повторять то, как развивалась речь у
      людей:<br>
      ребёнок который только начал более-менее говорить до сих пор
      путает язычные мж собой, но смешение язычных с губными происходит
      гораздо реже если происходит вообще: <br>
      л произносится как к, р произносится как н, ж наверное тоже как н:
      не только море, но и можно звучат как моне и мона (причём е и а
      скорее похожи на я) две сходные буквы сливаются как и кукла звучит
      как кука, потому что одиночная л тоже превращается в к <br>
      бб произносится как в: бибика звучит как вика. Что подтверждает,
      что разделение на губные и язычные фундаментально. потому баба и
      мама недалеко, но папа скорей всего из менее родственных, там где
      баба означает не женщину, но мужчину, т.е. народы называющие отца
      дядей отошли от тех, кто понимает, что папа это почти что мама,
      т.е. осознают связь секса с размножением, или те отошли от них.
      разделение между губныи и язычными фундаментально.<br>

      Today I had a conversation with a neighbour who told me he's from
      Kama. Is Perm in there? I asked him. And so we talked of Parma and
      around that, some incredible stories he told me: komi and permyaks
      are considered two different nations, so he said, that komi are
      princes (князья) or should I say were princes (князьями) <font
        color="#cc66cc">why did that wi appreared as ми in russian? <br>
        м = w ?<br>
        мы = we !</font><br>
      He also told me an almost unbelievable story, that пермяк солёные
      уши (permyak solted ears) is a meme which appeared when Ekaterina
      (probably th II) wanted to провести перепись населения<font
        color="#999999"> (то это и, может повторяться сколько угодно
        раз: я мог пожелать хотеть повести посмотреть и так далее, как
        обычное русское предложение (форма грамматическая такая сложна и
        потому встречается редко, но в ней нет ничего, что бы резануло
        слух обычного русского своей неграмотностью, разве что
        вычурностью или скорей прикольностью, необычностью. but in
        english they use no to after wanna. that's how russian and
        english are differently normalized: in english they would say I
        could wish to want to take go see, go instead of to was a <font
          color="#cccccc">type.y.</font>typo. So I was wrong, to goes as
        many times as you need it in both russian and english. </font><br>
      they didn't know how to be sure they don't write down the same
      permyak twice or more (because they were living in taiga (he said
      parma is taiga, the synonyms) and they could stay there for years.
      So russians cut upper pieces of their ears and thus they knew that
      this person they have already registered. And they kept those ears
      (they put them in salty water or to salt to keep them from
      decomposing, hence permyak salty ears.<br>
      I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see гравюры про тех индейцев,
      которым люди в латах руки и носы отрубали. если бы не слышал
      истории от иранца, рассказывающего что им арабы языки отрубали
      чтоб по персидски не говорили. Люди ебанутые существа, но раньше
      ещё ебанутее было, всего несколько веков назад. А где-то и по
      более древним законам живут, и хранители законов не менее безумны

      That guy also told me that старо-уйгурский (он же старотатарский)
      был вторым языком на руси во времена ивана грозного, когда в
      стране было двуязычие, и все знали два языка (в чём я дюже
      сомневаюсь, русские татарского не знают от слова вообще) а где ещё
      и малые народости жили, то и по три языка люди могли знать. эти
      малые народности может и знали, как татары знают два языка, а
      титульная нация как американцы языкам не обучены потому что пускай

      then gh in right is read as f, as in laugh <br>
      does that u labialize that gh? It could be, thus u is 。in ぱ so

      What I'm saying here is that writing systems take roots in the
      prehistoric civilizations, and japanese obviously have some
      elements of that utter culture in muchmore quantity than chinese.
      whatever history says. But kana do seem to be similar to alphabet
      too (so even if chinese hieroglyphic influenced the japanese, it
      was alike to french influence on britain, a couple of centuries,
      but that's roman influence, and it made the capital of the
      capitol. that capital thing came here poetically, so I take no
      responsibilities for whatever is here other than my will it may or

      Looking at tifinagh images in volume I, I have seen the alphabetic
      arrangement of it:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="IV_files/tifinagh.png" alt="" width="980" height="553"><br>
      <br>
      so I rearranged them in abcd structure in both basal and complete
      canons:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="IV_files/tifinagh_basal.png" alt="" width="637"
        height="572"><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="IV_files/tifinagh_complete.png" alt="" width="909"
        height="566"><br>
      <br>
      as I found five rows in the set, the complete one would perfectly
      arrange in 5 equal rows by 11 characters, but I only move the
      final dj to j set, to reflect ukrainian ї, but then what to do
      with the rest of the mess wasn't clear. Maybe to move ɛ to first
      gh (as they reflect one another, just as those doppelgangers of
      the first row. But those reflections are not recognized in the
      basal set, where ṛ &amp; ṣ reflect eachother this way, but stand
      for different letters. So I leave it for later, when I know more
      of it.<br>
      It's clear as well could stand for comparison, but became наречием
      (I don't remember the english term and out of internet now)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Now, why I opened tifinagh is it's t, which in its both forms
      remind euopean t (the modern and a couple millenia old) n reminds
      jewish nun sophit, m reminds jewish nun a little bit, but k and b
      more.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      japanese 田 is ta, and the cross could be the t, at least you may
      use it as a mnemonic tool. In chinese it's tien. I doubt it was
      t-in, but I will use it to remember the chinese reading.<br>

            which could be a coincidence but could be an evidence of the
            prehistoric cultural connections, which this book is about.
            not often do we know how those alphabets were influenced by
            one another and often those influences are not from the
            beginning, and the further in the pst the vaguer are the
            evidences. So, what Im saying here is I must compare all the
            hieroglyphs in boxes in this way, coming next) which tells t
            &amp; d are invariants and though alphabet obviously
            demonstrate the distinguishing between voiced and voiceless,
            kana just gives additional strokes alike to " above those
            voiceless bases to give voiced variants. Which can tell that
            whether kana (as in katakana &amp; hiragana) is older than
            alphabets or it came to japan when their language
            comprehended voiced and voiceless as the same thing, which
            could be both, which is the first case, but if it came as
            they say many centuries later than europe, then japanese
            people were retarded and didn't demonstrate the depth of
            cultural traditions even deeper than in China, which tells
            it's more probably China was influenced by Japan which
            probably also influenced europe through mongols . It' so
            freaky, I just leave it here for ai to investigate this
            unorthodox probability, for I hope artificial intelligence
            reaches this depth of the shovel first and reports it to me
            using the address on that envelope.</span></span></span><br>

      region's languages.<br>

      This image is here because of those alchemic-and-astrologic signs.
      They can have something to do with<br>
      and I have to understand these signs too<br>

      So we see here Ma in the centre. Very well. Pa is at the top of
      it. East is at the top? Sun is born there and rolls to the west,
      Ba is on the west of it, Pha is at the south of it, Bha is at the
      North of it.<br>
      Are those the dialectal forms of the labial morpheme?<br>
      And it seems sanskrit people look East, because there's the most
      of their students. So North is at their left arm and south at
      their right.<br>
      It reminds hebrew (ivrit, in case you didn't know its namer eminds
      sanskrit) three mothers, but in sanskrew there are whether one or
      five mothers, not three, but one and four more forms of it. I
      wonder what phenomenon could this numerology transcribe.<br>
      ṇa is under that triangle of labials. da at it's northern corner
      and some form of cha is at it's southern one.<br>
      what is the order of others I still have nothing to say, it's all
      new to me. It's another live session, a draft in print. Like the
      most of this work is, actuallly, but these few lines are art
      caused by ego, not sacred revelation, so fuck lyrics. Poetry is
      magic, but also waste of time because it programs chaotically,
      avoiding logical analysis, overt hte doors of admiration of
      beauty, something near sex sockets, eject, examine and erase the
      faul commands, please.<br>

      Devanagari is similar to arabic in having some letters not
      attaching to others (and also at the left of it, or in its right
      hand if it looks us with it's face, but india and pakistan write
      the opposite directions)<br>

      hungarian name, which makes me think that huns are hungarians
      (especially if -gar is a suffix of plural form, of which I do not
      know, only of -lar and -?ar in turkic languages) <br>
      Wiki tells such a hypothesis exists, but is't accepted by the
      official science, probably due to ethical issues of the historic
      records. Such probably is the case with berbers who are
      barbarians, am I freaky rn? Should I really care?<br>

      It would be a good ending, let it be. But I keep on, comparing old
      persian, philippinian &amp; iberian sillabaries or abugidas or
      whatever, alphabets. If sanskrit alphabet is alphabet, than so is
      philippinian abugidas, which are sometimes sillabaries (u in the
      most of them,) especially when they go ab, not ac.<br>

        because I never planned any of these, and it's somewhat weird,
        because that song is not straightly right-wing, but a tongue in

        Probably those crazy urges guarantee the survival of the culture

      A breakthrough, everyone!<br>
      I compared oghams between themselves, and figured out that
      initially there was only one and two, the bianry before one and
      zero. The binary which naturally grew out of unary numeral system,
      which is called in russian единичная, унарная, разная. И я сначала
      не понял почему разная? может равная? а, РАЗная! раз, раз, раз,

        ogham-like writings on american continent (which is nothing

        greenland and canada by ice. He could be taken there by
        fraudsters, or the results can be forgered, for replication

        that it happened, just like they figured out that people

      If there were only ones and twos, and three of which, could they
      be on a dice? <br>
      Not very likely, more likely the 5 oghams were on them, and the
      sixth side was blank. Is it how Y became the 6th vowel? It's just
      a guess, or apossibility to гадать (guess, tell fortune)<br>
      <br>
      Ogham has many common feature with the rest of european alphabets:
      o is double a, as in runes and as in dannish orthography. Ogham
      seems to be the pole of the labials-first thing, only for whatever
      reason it puts labials in odd position and linguals in the even.
      The only explanation I can see to it so far is that they were
      recognized not as labial, but nasal; and not lingual but oral,
      thus nose was male for it's a shaft and mouth was female for it's
      a hole. and here could the contradictions of mama-deda take place,
      that could explain why maður stands for man.<font color="#cccccc">
        (inhaled some sacred smoke)</font> My thought probably led me
      this way because eves even and adams add is based in our flesh, in

      more likely to be 1 for girls have lips - are they 2? 4? 6 with
      tits? I think it only tits count, for labia are behind the bush a
      guy also has, so it's like they just lack cock. so it's 1 for cock
      &amp; 2 for tits. систра. and... cook? cock, guard, gus, goose!

      ᚢ is probably П (p) because if we compare ᚮ lines in bornholm and

        ancient writing systems used in the Italian Peninsula between
        about 700 and 100 BCE, for various languages spoken in that time

        which was the immediate ancestor of the Latin alphabet currently
        used by English and many other languages of the world. The runic

      I don't know why I dwelve into historic reconstructions, when I
      noticed before that modern time cultures must have enough of
      information not to seek for knowledge in what academia feeds us.<br>
      <br>
      I collect all the writing systems, so let these be here too. I
      don't collect obviously artificial ones, because they are mostly
      random, but I wonder what made Tolkien invent that absolutely
      misleading tengwar and cirth (the latter probably littered
      runology with a sign or two) and why did he decide to use actual
      runes for urukrunes? Was it all just a propaganda piece against
      nazi? Even though he rigorously refused this interpretation,
      probably that is the sign it was a true one, otherwise why would
      he bother. He could also bother because it grew into something
      bigger than just a propaganda cloth. Those urukrunes could infest
      runology with its additional runes. But I decided not to post them
      here, but it... okay, here they are: <br>
      <a href="https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/urukrunes.php"><img

          height="660"></a><br>
      <br>
      I should look further into these forms, for the most of them are
      from elder futhark, but some are tolkien's fabrication for
      whatever reason, and a sh-rune he brought up looks like M as Ϻ
      which is notable, because in tengwar <font color="#cccccc">(even
        though graphically it reminds carolingian minuscule or some
        similar script)</font> he made his best to be as diffirent as
      possible from any european script, so this all of the sudden
      almost actual human script, and in the context of its revival in
      the Germany at the time of his work, it's definitely not just a
      coincidence. A spit into the well of runic scripts we yet have to
      scoop out.<br>
      I wonder why he set ᚦ for G, which is positionally (and
      graphically probable as a transliteration, but was it his (or his
      apprentices') actual discovery he locked from being discovered in
      the flock of his forgeries? <br>
      he also recognized ᚹ as P, which is not that far from W whichi is
      used for it's transliteration into Ƿ ƿ which is probably taken
      from the delacrian runes (see below)<br>
      a weird form of ᛋ, which is just a hand, but also inverted ᚱ for V
      which is pure poison, which though could relate to ᛣ recognized in
      runology as another form of ᚱ (R)<font color="#cccccc"> just as X,
        and Z see above</font><br>
      which is an inverse of ᛉ which is graphically the same as ᛘ (M,
      which reminds V, so who knows what he knew, he made some dubious
      magic to runes, and I only research it here to know the enemy.<br>
      he puts ᛩ for Z, though it is recognized on wiktionary as q, <br>
      he also inverted ᚦ for it's actual meaning, and it's one of the
      main rune: it stands in the third position in both futharks and
      alphabetic runesets. Inverted ᚦ appears in delacrian as q
      (probably same as above)<br>
      And if this set is fuckedup, cirth is pure dirth. and thus it will
      not appear here. <br>
      <br>
      I will post some actual runesets instead:<br>

      Im my blog I switched from mostly arts to mostly science in 2013
      when I began publishing this work.<br>
      It could've happened because I stopped reading fiction I felt
      amusing and even educative before.<br>
      I worded on this work for decades before that, but I hid it from
      plagiarists until it grew to sucn an anormous level no plagie can
      pledge out of here, but forgers on the other hand can forger
      artifacts using this work as a pattern for the forgery, so we
      should only trust artifacts registered before 2013, or maybe not,
      who cares, we readers never test their results, so we only trust
      them on word, and in replication crisis only half of the
      literature is better than fiction, the other half are worse, so
      now I think i got qnoyher level of elightenment, I stopped reading
      and I don't know how much time it takes me to actually stop
      reading anything but my own stuff or not to read iven thet, not to
      read other than what you immeditely write, not to bother your mind

      reality, we created it with what we read, and people around you
      read and watched pretty much what you did, so you have common
      culture with them, common abstract form which can be something
      more then just a memory, a tool we may use as we think <br>
      If I could only write with my eyes closed, the russian keyboard
      coming on without me noticing, I have to get myself english only
      keyboard. Imagine how less frustrated it is for english users in
      this world, no wonder they are making it alright.<br>
      But even english keyboard needs to be checked for bing on. I will
      meet Wishew in few days, he's a blind professor answering his
      emails, I need to ask him how he does it, what will be the next
      level of enlighetnment? avoiding sounds too? <br>

      riding hood could have been a felon. <br>
      wolf is volk in russian. volk is folk, people in german. Did
      russiand called рыцарей псами? Псы-рыцари, я слышал такое
      словосочетание.. и как раз о немцах:<br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">Псы-рыцари — эпитет, употребляемый в отношении
        рыцарей Тевтонского ордена. Представляет собой ошибочный перевод
        с нем. «Reitershunde». Более корректно по смыслу можно перевести
        как «рыцарский сброд», «конный сброд» или «конная свора». Данное
        выражение употребил К. Маркс в рукописи «Хронологические
        выписки», описывая борьбу Александра Невского с тевтонскими и
        ливонскими рыцарями. Это наименование широко распространено,
        стало фразеологизмом и даже попало в школьные учебники.
        Достоверных источников, подтверждающих наличие какой-либо
        «собачьей» атрибутики или ритуалов у данного рыцарского ордена,
        нет.<br>
        Популярным данный образ стал после выхода фильма «Александр
        Невский». Гавриил Горелов в 1947 году написал картину «Ведут
        псов-рыцарей во Псков», хранящуюся в Иркутском художественном
        музее. </font><br>

      I suddenly think that I'm near that border of crazy and weed
      helped me approach it too, so now I ask myself shouldn't I make a
      break again? take a break again. I probably went that far in this
      research because I stopped smoking for a 18 or so months but it
      was when I've built that mad apartment of mine, which is also a
      form of mad, even though it's safe and surprisingly professionally
      well, that is talent.<br>
      But that 18 months I didn't work on LTR, as I called AEIIOU
      before. A &amp; V are probably invariants, then Not relatively
      compled E (a &amp; u are also more complex and can be combinations
      of the two I will speak of in amonment) I &amp; O Stick &amp;
      Hole, The ultimate two, the most lingual and the most labial.
      Ogham have labial before lingual everywhere, not only in all
      consonants, but also in vowels, which is unique. So if that
      writing system is actually not a forgery,<font color="#cccccc"> as
        if we believe those expensive methods we don't have access to
        will be the case,</font> but actual ancient artefacts (as their
      primitive form can say. or could it be a cyphre created by someone
      who knew letters. No, the most primitive forms should have been
      found, and ogham is exactly that much primitive. So am I biased or
      did alphabts appeard in Ireland? What is Ire and why is it so
      oppressed by their great neighbour, or was it just eathen by the
      brittish crown as it's eaten scotland before that, and suddenly
      the politics changed, people think it's not cool to conquer the
      neighbours, and religious question between protestants and
      catholics isn't that important, but why do I speak of that, this
      level of kvetching deserves to be avoided, we have to focus on
      humans in general being less opressed by their communities big or
      huge, or even not by small ones like families and friends, to
      float in enormous pleasure of solitude of the artificial biologic
      bubble for us to leave ultimately protected and prepared for the
      eternity. Let the race begin! <br>
      Was Phoronean sister Io mistranslated and being<font
        color="#cccccc"> to </font>not sister, but some invention by
      some Phoroneus.<br>
      I just noticed I wrote to instead of not, I'm sorry for such typos
      I didn't notice yet.<br>
      AMT IO (three sisters (three mothers) of AMT and phoronean IO
      could make the first alphabet. And if we combine it as syllabaries
      do, it's I MI TI O MO TO <br>
      All of the sudden, I can translate it: ? МЫ ТЫ ? МОЁ ТВОЁ<br>
      Ты (you) could be Te (those)<br>
      Mы (we) could be Me (literally me) but then I cannot be Я, what is
      I? 1? here? this? grammatic one?<br>
      I here O there? or are IO the A? a when written as α does look
      like oi. and it's name in english is ai.<br>
      So it's neither I nor O, but only the four of ME THEE MY THY<br>
      Are AV those very OI? the other representation of IO, If I stands
      for A and O for U, it explains ا.<br>
      So it's MA TA&nbsp; of AMT recognized some grammatic accents and
      gave birth to MY Thye, and because thy is thy and not ty, ta is
      tha as ת is, as ᚦ si, sa Δ is (english is inverted spanish?
      spaniards must <font color="#cccccc">accept </font>admit brits
      figured it out not bad, but as is a dirty word, is it the same
      fags rule tw thing?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Was these two words Ma (mine) &amp; Ta (take, thine and maybe even
      thanks) enough until Phoroneus recognized that there are A &amp; V
      and not only M &amp; T<br>
      and here paradoxically M takes the nonlabial A and T meets V once
      again. Becaseu MA is more natural than overlabialized MV, it could
      be double M, but not like this, V ~ ν (and n ~ m. is m double n??)
      and thus it's double in ᛗ (they say ᛥ is stone for st. If people
      actually used this complicated system, they probably didn't know
      of roman, which way easier, and thus they are not directly relatd
      to it, it's some different page of the culture of writing systems,
      so I ignore historic datings, I know they were wrong before, I
      know they are wrong half of the time now, I know they will be
      exposed wrong many times again, so I focus on the structures and I
      figure out the flow of invention by their mere forms and
      structures ignoring datings I cannot double-check. Statistics made
      by AI's can work here, but mere human intelligence can do the
      trick too. I don't know AIs, and I'm not sure it's easier to check
      their though process than those carbon datings, but what I know
      about it tells me they are recognized to be not reliable after
      humans began nuclear explosions, so how are we supposed to verify
      that it was reliable before that? So neither AI nor carbon shit is
      my way, I surch by hand, by highed mined. hind, what a complicated
      beautiful word, how far have language traveled from MA ТHA to
      conceive it) <br>
      Is it Mother?<br>
      No wonder Sefer Yetsirah misspelled AMT (truth) as AMS (darkness)
      for T &amp; S both come from that primitive ᚦ<br>
      Or is that darkness there <font color="#cccccc">(also translated
        as yesterday, last night, which could be a modern poetic

      Is it how religions keep on float, stumbling upon itself somehow
      in a dance move keeps on walking on?<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      If first two words are M &amp; T (mine and their) then it's inhale
      and exhale, Take as Да (duh, yeah) and geMMe as No. Their is a
      more common case than Thine (you can take it if they don't mind,
      for for the speaker "you" is a part of "they"<br>
      <br>
      Mine = No (don't take) <br>
      Yours = Yes (take)<br>
      I didn't expect yours to be so similar to yes, so now I suppose it
      is a supporting element to this guess.<br>

      CO in СОда? да is Na? both are finals in their lines, both are

      I believe previous civilization reached atoms around 400bc ... so
      I look for formulas in chemical words, and what I find is bc is
      the core of the alphabet, and ad is what is added to it (vowels
      and complexion into linguals) <br>
      if it's b/c, not b/d, then b = p = ɔ and c = q = d which correlate
      with their articulatory features too.<br>

      Before AMᚦ was Mᚦ that is why ɑ reminds d, they are invariants.<br>
      Mᚦ is Matter and A is Ather, Air, neither liquid M nor Hard D? or
      was D fire? The opposite of water is fire, air comes from fire
      more naturally than from solids, Here we meet another question we
      met before: is A air or <font color="#cccccc">E</font>arth?<br>
      vowels are airy, seferyetzirah sais it's air, air comes from fire
      well, and in earth version vowels come out of water. So once we
      find what part of letters gave vowels we see if it's air or soilid<br>
      V is of labials, that's historically registered, I have not much
      to say of the origin of other vowels.<br>
      O is of V, whether it's AV (au) or form of ע, reminding У or Oy
      (Ѹ) insteado of u or the form of old russian Ꙋ ꙋ <br>
      But those are labial vowels, no wonder they descend from the
      labials,<br>

      position of h, if it's an invariant of ᚦ<br>
      is h a open ᚦ or a half of it? half of the one is half. It
      correlates with ᚠᚴ looking like halves of ᛒᚦ<br>
      if both ᚴ &amp; h are halves of ᚦ, then g &amp; h are invariants?
      Г as this high. HuГе? <br>

      is ᛦ[r]<br>
      I've got lost in a previous research made by someone I don't know.
      Why don't I remember replication crisis more and do it from
      scratch and all along by the very same method of noticing, not
      reading.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      From now on I do my best only to study languages I know exist and
      I study them and not just read about them. English, Russian,
      Japanese, is the axis of my main comparison. Hebrew appears from
      time to time, but I know it's rather artificial, so I will study
      bible's hebrew more. And Latin languages too.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Sanskrit &amp; Sakartvello should be also learned. Sanskrit is
      suprisingly european, over russian, it's more russian than
      european. So it's surprising russians don't study sanskrit and
      shows who actually rules the play. Even when we loved indian
      musicals, nobody learned hindu or sanskrit, they say hindu is less
      russian, for it mutated its own way since sanskrit and rasnskrit
      (russian.script) spread ways. Was хождение за три моря по землям,
      где жили люди, что остались жить после того как санскритики
      travelled south. Is sanskrit some ancient form of russian? Some
