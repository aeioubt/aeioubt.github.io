      Another fascinating dream just woke me up. It told me that ᛋ
      stands for Shake.<br>
      And it's fascinating, because the rune itself represents a shaky
      staff.<br>
      And it precedes ᛏ which probably stands for Tott (death)<br>
      And it's very simbolic that this book begins like this because
      it's volume 4, which I began yesterday, before I went to sleep,
      and 4 symbolizes death in japanese culture while 13 stands for
      death in tarot (1+3=4) and that dream began (from what I remember
      but that very ᛏ which I wanted to omit, but I just got distracted
      and by an accident listened to this s<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc6kRHoVd8w"><font
          color="#000000">O</font></a>ng which ends with "soil for the
      dead, land of fools" so now I must tell how that nightdream began:
      It was about a couple of empty slots about which something asked
      why can't we take this place, and someone from the neighbouring
      slot on the right said that we cannot, because russians are ᛏ and
      I don't know what it means, something like this, so those two
      slots the right one is ᛏ and the previous is ᛋ standing for shake.<br>
      And only when I woke up did I rationalize it that hands shake
      before one dies, or ᚱ is crush after which person shakes, and then
      he dies, and then goes ᚢ which could go vor valhalla (fallhill,
      холм павших)<br>
      or my interpretation of those normanic words is just how brits or
      russians would interpret it, what is it..<br>

      I wondered why was the previous volume ended so early (it's weighs

      Clock goes clockwise, degrees go counter-clockwise.<br>
      This probably relates to the way different cultures write (left to
      right or right to left)<br>
      also notice that clock begins at the top, while degrees begin an
      the right end (probably because the culture which made them this
      way was writing right to left, thus clocks were made this way <font
        color="#cccccc">(even if before that clock used to go
        counter-clockwise, but the term itself tells me that hardly
        could it be so)</font> by a culture writing left to right.<br>

      This volume will mostly be about other topics.<br>
      <br>
      Absolute immortality:<br>
      embryonic conditions protect from traumas, biota, viriota, and if
      that articial uterus is protected by enough armor, it can protect
      you also from quakes of all sorts, in perspective maybe even from
      planetary events. Total control under innercapsular condition (a

      think muslim isis could be invented to cloud the issue of the
      goddess Blawatski revealed to the world (I never read her books, I
      told you it's just a draft, thoughts to be analyzed by ai, or by

      s as g? and we know both are forms of c, which is с[s] in russian.<br>

      её in latin is quod<br>
      her (её) is eius if we ask google's translator not in russian, but
      in english. and also sua is her<br>
      I also think it's eia, not eius.<br>
      his is eius, illius, ipsius, suus, inlius, ollius<br>
      (inlus could be an invariant of illius, and thus il &amp; in are

      it is quod, illud, ollud, inlud<br>
      she is quæ, illa, ea, inla, olla, and if it's not pronoun, but
      noun, it's juvenca also written as iuvenca<br>
      ему is illi.<br>
      him is eum, illum, hunc, inlum, ollum (comare his &amp; him to her
      to know which her is which)<br>
      ей is translated as eius, though I think it's eia, because -us is
      male suffix. Even though there's <a

      Back to my capsule to live in: it should be covered with touch
      screen from the inside, so it can emulate windows to her/his
      friends' capsules or merely to their phones or computer screen.<br>
      We have got this with sounds already, we call by voice all the
      time, though some of us use video connections daily. The future is
      here, but it is not equally distributed. It's a quote, here's a
      more precise form of it:&nbsp; The future is already here — it's
      just not very evenly distributed. (William Gibson)<br>
      <br>
      So my task is to build the future I see wanted for me and my
      friends, and for everybody who wants it. If it reminds you what
      you saw in Matrix movie, this is another movie, in mine users are
      totally aware of their conditions and they have total control over
      it. Also in the Matrix movie the true storyline could be a high
      civilization hacked by the blackies from a backward culture. We
      only know of what's going on because Morpheus told us, but who
      knows if he was telling the truth? Neo believed him as a teacher
      never asking himself what if it was a hacker? Neo was unaware of
      the world outside of Matrix, so of course he trusted the man who
      shown him what it was even if he was only saying it. Could it be
      that he wasn't lying, but honestly believing some misconceptions
      their culture had about the Matrix? Of course it's possible,
      consider how many misconceptions and misunderstandings do we have
      not only about the world which is bigger than us, but also about
      our own cultural things. First of all because those who
      conceptualized it are gone, and misinterpreters are always
      present.<br>
      <br>
      Back on track. Those spheres will be packed whether in one level,
      to prevent squashing of the lower layers by the weight of the
      upper spheres? though upper spheres could suppors ceilings of the
      lower layers by being connected to the other spheres in the upper
      layer. Then those agglomerations should be not hills, but filled
      into ravines, stretched among the sides of the canyon.<br>
      Or should we be in one layer, to own what is above and below us.<br>
      We would probably build sphere below and probably above of our
      sphere, where we do all kinds of works, but most of all to collect
      the related items. Wine collectors will drill cellars of spiral
      ladders under the survace, because that's where cellars are
      supposed to be, but they will also descend into that moist putting
      what a robot running those srairs transmit to owner's spheric
      touchscreen.<br>
      <br>
      The immediate upper and lower spheres will <font color="#cccccc">me</font>
      be service facilities: upper would supply the pilot with liquid
      and food (or with blood if we have grown our placenta back) and
      the lower sphere will take our biological tailings to feed them to
      the vegetation growing in the lower spirals lighted by energy of
      geotermal depth. Only lamps should be eternal. Everything should
      be built to last forever. The absolute is an abstraction, and it
      can be only reached with perfection, enhanced all the time by
      human genius. And soon AI genius will join the party. They already
      do.<br>

      Эстонец женился на русской, вечером приходит с работы: „опят фэс

      <font color="#666666">К чему-то я этот анекдот рассказал, но лишь
        записал увидел в нём двойной смысл, но забыл к чему он

        суть инварианты<br>
        Является ли слово ссут обыгрышием (обыгрыванием) устаревшего
        ныне "суть"(sunt (they are)) just as сру может быть когнатом
        слова сижу? Т.е сру является эвфемизмом слова какаю? Странно,
        что сегодня это воспринимается наоборот. Какать is cognate of to
        poop which is faire caca in french.</font><br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      French faire reminds english fairy, which bring those to be and to
      do for B &amp; D also standing for Bad &amp; Dead(? I was speaking
      of Bad &amp; Good where B is Ba &amp; G is Goo, but before that
      was it B &amp; D? for these two letters often reflect eachother (G
      = C = staveless D(it's more obvious when it's c &amp; d)), those
      two first letters could be recognized as Баба &amp; Деда, but if b
      = v (russian В is V) then it's Vava &amp; Дада thus V ~ M.<br>
      Anv V does look like staveless ᛘ (which stands for M. there's a
      similar rune recog<br>
      I recognized ᛣ as y, because the source I used recognized it like
      this, but wi <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%9B%A3">k</a>
      tionary tells it's k, which makes sense, because q is in that
      region. But q is not after, but before R (that final line goes
      ᚮᚱᛣᛋᛏᚢ) and I got used to reading it as Ari Satana&nbsp; Arch
      Satan makes not less of a sense and this sequence could be the
      origin of the word Satan into hebrew (if it really originates
      there, whichever language it originates, it could originate (to
      origin? to originate would be the form, which reminds to beat =
      бить, and there's at least another case like this, I met it today
      I don't remember it now, will try to revisit this piece, or if it
      happens in the following volumes, I will only mention it without
      touching this one)<br>
      <br>
      ᛣ also reflects ᚵ, which recalls that velar column, but it's not a
      very good of an argument to recognize<br>
      ᛣ as [k], because those are the only two on this column. Only if ᚦ
      is recognized as C, because it's after B of ᛒ and it reminds P
      which reminds Г, which stands for C (even though it sounds as G,
      it stands where C does, and G is the "dotted" variant of C, just
      as ᚵ is the dotted <font color="#999999">in</font>variant of ᚴ,
      which would also stand in this column, if M was where it was
      supposed to be, just after the vowel ᛁ, and thus this vowel column
      can be reconstructed as IMKLN. And we don't need the J, which only
      latin <font color="#999999">(and russian!!! but not greek!!!)</font>
      has, to have K in the velar column. other than this line is one
      letter shy in comparison with the following two (though it could
      have samekh) and it makes the alphabet not one but two letters shy
      to... or is it short and not shy? my language is something else.
      not one but two letters short to be used as 9-mal, actually called
      nonary notation <font color="#999999">(or something of the kind)</font><br>

      I spit from my apartment's balcony and a guy walking a dog towards
      it was stopped by the dog stopping for whatever reason in the
      grass. And dog could have predicted me wanting to spit and wind
      being able to move it towards their direction. If they didn't
      stop, it could get on man or a dog. Baka dimaen<br>
      So what is dog if not a superficial being. Dog is god? Dog is good

      School is related to scholastic. Bringing the discipline,
      programming by mere culture to be slave. Kids dressed as hares or
      roosters, whether in children't masquerade, or in kindergarden
      plays, it was probably ment to build the hierarchy, but I found it
      in an anecdote:<br>
      In kindergardens, boys are dressed as hares &amp; girls are
      dressed as snowflakes. Is it why all the guys grow up into cowards
      and girls grow up to be cold? This is russia, baby. We're so
      fucked for runnng away, for wanting anomie from their pity rule.
      They probably named as slaves, for punks were paptized from the
      outside.<br>

      A БВ&nbsp; ГД<br>
      wow, I didn't expect it to correlate so much. Not only russians
      have double labial in their first line, but X is as aphricate as
      ГД in ГДе, and that's how russian alphabet goes, ГДЕ, just as Y
      doesn't leave the X.<br>
      Z reminds greek Д (Δ) by pronounciation of <a

      thus X y Z is where is someZing<br>

      в этом и причина того что от [ot] contains that t which reflects

      exactly the near. So is R &amp; h are invariants? I think I spoke
      about it in the very beginning of the book. hi again. and when I
      wanted to copy it to say that next is literally nearest,<br>
      it gave me this text just behind that image:<br>

      just checked my watches and I'm extremely pleased to see I'm on
      time in case of next standing for nearest, even though I
      recognized neah as near, not nigh, thogh near is nigh, I believe
      my etymology is even better, this is why I dare to make my
      research as independent as possible. because I'm good in it.<br>
      <br>
      nigh is a good word, speaking of night as of nighed eye of the god
      (or the world) which corresponds egyptian belief of sun being the

      orthography of old english give nigh and night as neah and neaht.
      that is encouraging.<br>

      act is ached? вынужденная мера?<br>

      and thinking of checking all te words ending with t, I found put
      and ask is it of poo?<br>
      some dirty word not understand as offensive and related to those
      dirty ones anymore?<br>
      just as in russian we have words like худ (full form is худой,
      similar suffix is used for adjectives in japanest, btw) and that
      word has two meanings: thin &amp; bad. and both semm (seem or
      same) to be related to хуй (penis) another word for bad: хуёвый is
      directly relative to хуй. худ буквально рождённый (данный) хуем?

      I just visited official Morbid Angel website, and it rotated with
      our galaxy in counter-clockwise. And it made me understand that
      those rotations are clockwise and counter-clockwise from different
      sides. I have no idea if it can be applied to the luck, because
      unlucky swastica is lucky on the other side. As if swasticka is
      the channel, moving good to one side and bad to the uther. Sun
      dries, but its beams fall down. so which is it? Sun goes
      clock-wise, and its shadow also go clockise, which is weird,
      because projection of the movie would mirror, and the difference
      between sun and a movie is that movie is from a static dot, while
      projection moves the source of the rotation, and not the rotation
      on the screen. But what's the difference, wouldn't the white image
      on the dark screen be equal to the sun? Shadow of the sun is not
      sun't projection. It's the opposite of that, so maybe that's why
      it acts this way. I leave it here.<br>

      Musical instruments are solid objects, the hight of solid tubes
      defines their tone.<br>
      I dont know why but I reflectory understood that water is good.
      Probably because the water vortex in the northern demisphere is
      the unlucky one, probably because it's downwards. Air is bad

      why can't apes say coronal sounds, only labial and maybe some
      velar and vowels of course.<br>
      Was lingua qualitatively different from what beasts could speak
      before. We are sent to earth by the creator, according to the
      myths of the past. And those very myths defined the way language
      developed. The language itself can tell stories of the past, and
      them being naturally not always accurate can influence our
      understanding of situation, even when we know that the opposite is

      teacher is lector, he lego, lesen(reads), students leren(learn)<br>

          in Q, and that the author of Matthew merged it with the well

        frater is brother, once again two different labials act as
        dialectal invariants of the same, which tells that each line
        stands for different nation, just as differen musical mode used
        to stand for different mediterranian nation. If E is for Europe,
        A is for Asia of Anatolia, or Asia from which barbarians came,
        or for Africa if barbarians were berbers, but I don't know any
        of african languages to say anything valuable on this issue.<br>

      And whence I wrote it, a document to get my pasport from some
      government office was lost. It was just gone the way people
      usually blame transcendent speices for such tricks. But the
      passport was obtained without it, so it's not a punishment, but a
      joke, so I get the form I god I envoke, so it seems my jokingly
      nature envoked Loki (a little loco (?)) side of the one. the one
      is the world, of course, we're all loci of that world (I didn't
      expect to use that much similar word here, this poetry writes
      itself)<br>
      <br>
      And I was very lucky, locky is lucky, and my cousin gave me a ride
      to all the tourist sho u ps and I bought everything I need for
      camping, and a wind-costume named EKUD. And I looked at that word
      from the top of it, and I undoubtedly read DUKE, and that explains
      why ᚢ is U, because you can rotate letters, people rotate letters,
      only they don't rotate them, they flip it, so b ~ p and d ~ q -
      probably left and right was important and counterposed when this
      orthography made the canon.<br>
      But double flip is rotation, so b &amp; d used to stand for the
      same letter (look at roman cursive and at boustrophedon)<br>
      <br>
      Probably, when rhythm was the thing and vowels and consonants were
      all the difference, but then again why d &amp; a are so similar,
      and u &amp; v<br>
      And that EKUD thing also demonstrate how n is not var vrom n. ν

      This book contains lots of trolling, but with an important
      message: how many guys were misunderstood and considered crazy?
      Semmelweis was just one famous example? How many of those are due
      to corruption by the system and the relatives and how many of
      those patients are there due to natural incompetence of normies to
      destinguish genius from crazy?<br>
      <br>
      Back to me being a god: this worlds acts the way I make it to do,
      so the world and me is one indivisible system. I&amp;I, it works
      the way we do.<br>

      A new thing I brough t from an awesom e travel is that some words

      will scan them on video latedr<br>

      moon &amp; sun<br>
      thur could be whether four (being of θ ) or third before weden's
      day stood within<br>
      <br>
      In some cultures this sequence is also shifted in a way that
      sunday stands for 1 &amp; saturday for 7<br>
      I consider it a jewish herecy. errecy.<br>
      In russian week begins on monday, and I dare to say it's the
      original order.<br>
      <br>
      And that wedensday - was it the same reform which took place when
      Jupiter replaced Minerva?<br>
      and when six notes became seven notes, and 666 (of three octaves?
      or whatever it was called then) was declared to be satanic with
      777 taking it's place. Azot (literally un-life) instead of carbon
      being the essential part of all the life on earth (maybe except ai
      which only recently appeared and didn't exist when the most of
      events described in this book took place) - and it's time to see
      numerical value of silicone, to develop the new eon's numerology.<br>
      366 can be devided into 61 weeks by 6 days each, but not only
      doesn't it ring any bell (52 weeks are also 52 cards) but it also
      doesn't make any sense in the context of moon phases.<br>
      While 7 suns = 1 moon (1 phase of the moon, one face of the
      goddess, or one of those three (actually four) goddesses which is
      the one)<br>
      <br>
      Could one of those days be off he grid? The holy day, hidden from
      calendar as that fourth moon is hidden? Because I heard of
      additional days added to the calendar but not in the calendar. And
      though those days were the leap days at the end of the year, could
      it be a more common tradition?<br>
      <br>
      And once I fell into this dissonance, I recalled that lunar month
      is not 28, but 29.5 days. thus 6 could be quite a divider. though
      was it 5 weeks of 6 days or 6 weeks by 5 days?<br>
      Pentatonic scale being the most natural and extremely prominent
      before the 6-tet and later 7-tet scales were established tells
      that it probably was 5 days per week. And to this day work week is
      5 days and 2 additional days are holidays. Also words<font
        color="#999999"> "woke" </font> <font color="#cccccc">"wok.."</font>
      "work" &amp; "week" could be actually related, because in russian
      week is неделя, the word which is believed to be used for weekend,
      and later spread on all the week, which is weird, because it also
      believed to stand for "не делая" (not doing, not working) it can
      damage russian logos big time. Also the word "woke", which I
      didn't expect but my fingers typoed it in, could be related to
      work, who knows.<br>
      So if it's 6 weeks of 5 days, then there's not 4 phases to the
      moon, but 6. Are those three ladies and their reflections? Waxing
      tridevi &amp; waning ones? Trinity of the light &amp; trinity of
      the darkness? Tridevi &amp; Trimurti? This I doubt, but Light
      &amp; Dark trinities could be the thing, I think I read something
      of the kind.<br>
      <br>
      Historians say Roman weeks were 8 days long, which doesn't make
      sense at all.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Monogamous is he who get one (mono, moon) gamets? gamuts? gamet of
      game? gamut is gamma, thus gam e with different suffixes. or is it
      the same suffix? is it where Тm &amp; Mm meet.<br>
      ut = ma? ut = do. do and ma are the opposites are they not? as dad
      &amp; mom. o &amp; a are the other way around.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      уму не вообразимо = ему не вообразимо.<br>

      <font color="#cccccc">здесь хотел разобрать слово ухо, но понял
        что такие вещи должн приходить спонтанно<br>
        just as this:</font><br>
      <br>
      witch, doctor! doctor as dochter (daughter)<br>
      witch is wife<br>
      wi as in wimen<br>
      we, men. ma in plural.<br>
      guys simply usurped the right to use this title.<br>
      <br>
      witch, <font color="#cccccc">coctor </font>doctor<br>
      which envoces a female to treat, t cure, t cr.<br>
      We have to return to consonant writing: it gives less clarity in
      how to read, but gave all the spectre of meanings: cure is also to
      care. to cure is to care&gt;!<br>
      <br>
      woman has wo in it. as in chinese wo for I<br>
      women has we in it. as in english we for we.<br>
      <br>
      thus it's wemen, which became confu l sing when males (also
      usurped title) took over.<br>
      confusing = con foux sing (con(with) foo(bad, false) sing(note))<br>

          The distinction between <i>Eta</i> and <i>Epsilon</i> and
          between <i>Omega</i> and <i>Omicron</i>, adopted in the
          Ionian standard, was traditionally attributed to <a

        Those are the same Palamedes.</p>

      probably they both knew that he added some letters, but they had
      different opinion upon it. And probably Hyginus knew better, even
      though Plutarch is more famous among masses. It's an honour that
      wiki lists Hyginus the first. Probably academia figured something
      right. I never said they were all faggots, only some of them, and
      that banter was cast most of all at the school of Plato, which is
      watever it was neamed.<br>

      I remember that this book looks (not is, compare this too verbs, I

      I probably don't know many such words in english, but I probably
      can tell the most common ones, like<br>
      be see do. Though I'm not sure see is the correct word for C, but
      Г stands there, which is for гляди, which probably comes from
      глаза (glaz (~glass) is eye in russian)<br>
      <br>
      f is fuck<br>
      g is go<br>
      h is high<br>
      <br>
      though I don't know if it's even valuable in the slightest. H
      could be that new letter, just as N<br>
      First of all because there are misconceptions about how to read
      them. A and even B sound somewhat the same in all of them. A is
      vowel, B is labial - at least this is rather universal.<br>
      H &amp; P are read differently, just as n and actually m. Will I
      countseeder M &amp; T newer letters? Probably not, so this m n
      thing should have some other explanations, of which I'm still
      unaware. Though M stands for death just as T does: mori.<br>

      Here we learn to get dismissed and promiss to return with new
      portion of the treat in the next decade. Maybe will publish
      shorter versions of the same and will post videoshots of th'drafts<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Okay, here I realized why drafts are not being published, now I
      keep on writing this as a draft (for I warned you about not taking
      on faith anything you read here, especially after some point)<br>
      <br>
      colours of the rainbow: when there were only 5 notes, could there
      be only 5 recognized colours?<br>
      I'd say they were red yellow green blue violet.<br>
      and then I compared those five to the vowels:<br>
      <font color="#ff0000">A</font><br>
      <font color="#ffff00">E</font><br>
      <font color="#33cc00">I</font><br>
      <font color="#3333ff">O</font><br>
      <font color="#cc33cc">U</font><br>
      <br>
      I'm pretty sure Artur had it recognized differently, but here I
      used the nomenclature I use: lingua green and labia blue. Not sure
      if I'm going anywhere from here, but deicided to share.<br>
      <br>
      Also the historic account, when Carmenta created the 15 letter
      alphabet, what were those 15 letters?<br>
      I'd say they were 5 vowels and 5 labials and 5 linguals. For runic
      alphabet from Bornholm shows the first line in three letters only.
      And the final line of ugaritic is triliteral too, btw. It's as if
      they spread from the same source but in all the different ways.<br>
      <br>
      So let's make an attempt to reconstruct it:<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      ᛆᛒᚦ<br>
      ᚾᚠᚵᚼ(or ᛡ)<br>
      ᛁᚴᛚᛘ(even though it looks like ᛉ)ᚿ<br>
      ᚮᚱᛣᛋᛏ<br>
      ᚢ<br>
      though the axial representation tells that ᚢ is probably
      consonant, here I need 5 vowels, and ᚢ is the most vowel after
      those other four.<br>
      But suddenly I don't feel like going any further on this one. It
      doesn't seem to leas anywhere yet.<br>
      <br>
      But technically it's how it repeats the latin alphabet.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">I didn't make any перестановок yet.</font><br>
      <br>
      Also <font color="#000000"><a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcYCT9wEUuU"><font
            color="#000000">here</font></a></font>'s a video I saw
      today, an israelite there teaches that you shouldn't learn russian
      grammar.<br>
      He's correct. That's the way to learn russian. And probably any
      other language. But though they taught us grammar in schools,
      russians don't speak english. Their government doesn't want them
      to. Thus their government commits crime against humanity. At last
      I found the difference between a and no a.<br>
      And here's correct, but why I brought it to you is any grammatic
      form could be the basic one. Brits use imperative in their
      dictionaries, russians use indefinite form.<br>
      <br>
      Imagine f russians used imperatives. They wanted to save ink when
      they removed swashes of the ъ's<br>
      Think not about how less ink would it take to publish
      dictionaries, but how upraising would it be to rusian spirit. but
      russians are named so because they crush (рушат) больше чем
      создают.<br>
      <br>
      больше боль<br>
      лучше луч<br>
      хорошее в мужском роду, плохое в женском. ше = ещё (в украинком
      ще, читается ште. украинский похоже более древний, чем русский)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      а в белее ее тоже ещё? похоже на то. только в -ше проглотили е, а
      в -ее проглотили щ редуцировав до j. которая в форме dʒ&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Let's make those перестановка's:<br>

      <br>
      ᛆᛒᚦ<br>
      ᚾᚠᚵᚼ(or ᛡ)<br>

      <br>
      I'm looking how it can be 5*3:<br>
      <br>
      ᚠᚵ&nbsp; belong together, because they reflect ᛒᚦ<br>
      thus ᚼ(or ᛡ) belongs near ᚢ as in уфх<br>
      and also notice, that ᚼ(or ᛡ) becomes the final letter, and being
      staveless it's stavless form is ᚷ which reminds the final letter
      of the phoenician.<br>
      <br>
      ᚼ(or ᛡ)<br>
      reflects<br>
      ᛘ(or ᛉ)<br>
      whatever were the reason, these two letters were misinterpreted in
      some tribes.<br>
      which tells they bth could be newer. I didn't expect to see M
      together with its invariant N among newer letters, though I knew N
      is for new.<br>
      when people invented NO? these two letters go together in the
      alphabet.<br>
      IPRT (iprit?) could be the final line. and if P=R (probable sound
      of fart it was) IPT is the final line.<br>
      ipt sounds as russian tabooed maeter word ёпт and i is called yod
      in hebrew. so dots about i could be dots aboue ё.<br>
      <br>
      About = above to? as onto, into, hereto, thereto<br>
      <br>
      Thus ᛁᚴᛚ is the third line? up and down. I would expect to see ᛁ ᛘ
      ᚴ repeating that 21 sequence.<br>
      And once again ᛘ wants to be after ᛁ so I sthink it used to be
      there. THat it's K the new letter, wanted for C-column, whic is
      not in the alsphabet I'm looking for.<br>
      also notice, that in that ᛁ ᛘ ᚴ ᚴ can also be both ᛚ&amp;ᚿ because
      on single stav those two are the same (and they sound almost the
      same (maybe n is a little neather (ниже) and l is alter. a nd
      chances are I found their meaning, I will look at it and report on
      whether it's correct or nah) and up or down is not so important
      (according to ᚮ standing for double ᛆ looks like reverse ᛓ on the
      bornholm stone:<br>
      <br>

        alt="" width="354" height="519"> The final line ᚮᚱᛣᛋᛏ surprises
      that it doesn't have an obvious labial<br>
      unless&nbsp; ᚱ is secretly П. then ᛣ could be Р(R) or is it the
      ancient labial reflecting ᛉ ? as ᛘ ' s actually writ.<br>
      I compare bornholm to russian, because there is some evidence that
      these runes are russian, probably that's why some official freak
      is the only one who researches this artefact. and now also I do.<br>
      ᛋ always confused me, for how would it break the stav. only when
      runes became more like letters and less like ogham could this
      letter emerge.<br>
      So is it ᚮᚱᛏ or is it ᚮᛣᛏ? It's either this or that. I like ORT
      for it even looks like ART.<br>
      even if it sounded more like opyt (опыт, experience<font
        color="#cccccc"> ~ exercise</font> ~ experiment)<br>
      <br>
      Now, what will we put after ᚢ?<br>

      And here wiki explains why it's ᚮᚱᛏ and not ᚮᛣᛏ.<br>
      And it's also ᚢ ᛘ ᚼ because ᛘ sometimes looks like ᛙ which makes
      it even more similar to УФХ. If its УМх then it ould stand for
      умер, which begins with ум (wisdom) and the alphabet could be the
      life story. B is for Born, I noticed it before, I still have no
      bright picture about it, but Motherhood is in the middle, it make
      it all maek sense. and alsi ᚢᛘᚼ because the third letter is double
      the second. And also notice that second can be seen as the double
      first one. I use these awkward "secon", "first one" because runes
      are truly magic and don't allow to be copy-pasted easily. It's
      tricky and act weird.<br>

      What if english verbs ending in -t are the special ones? more
      ancient ones?<br>
      get put set rot! (за)рыть то что rots<br>
      lot wet hot - are those verbs<br>
      let! what? hight!<br>
      list wrist? wrestle?<br>
      oh, that's a work for ai<br>
      beat as a form of be? get as a form of go? мало схватить, важно
      ещё и уйти с добычей. g œ t=утащил.<br>

        in russian cop is musor (literally trash) in english it's
