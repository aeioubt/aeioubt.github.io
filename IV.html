      Another fascinating dream just woke me up. It told me that ᛋ
      stands for Shake.<br>
      And it's fascinating, because the rune itself represents a shaky
      staff.<br>
      And it precedes ᛏ which probably stands for Tott (death)<br>
      And it's very simbolic that this book begins like this because
      it's volume 4, which I began yesterday, before I went to sleep,
      and 4 symbolizes death in japanese culture while 13 stands for
      death in tarot (1+3=4) and that dream began (from what I remember
      but that very ᛏ which I wanted to omit, but I just got distracted
      and by an accident listened to this s<font color="#000000"><a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc6kRHoVd8w">O</a>ng
        which ends with "soil for the dead, land of fools" so now I must
        tell how that nightdream began: It was about a couple of empty
        slots about which something asked why can't we take this place,
        and someone from the neighbouring slot on the right said that we
        cannot, because russians are ᛏ and I don't know what it means,
        something like this, so those two slots the right one is ᛏ and
        the previous is ᛋ standing for shake. <br>
        And only when I woke up did I rationalize it that hands shake
        before one dies, or ᚱ is crush after which person shakes, and
        then he dies, and then goes ᚢ which could go vor valhalla
        (fallhill, холм павших) <br>
        or my interpretation of those normanic words is just how brits
        or russians would interpret it, what is it..<br>

        I wondered why was the previous volume ended so early (it's
        weighs less than a half of previous one)<br>

        This probably relates to the way different cultures write (left

        also notice that clock begins at the top, while degrees begin an
        the right end (probably because the culture which made them this
        way was writing right to left, thus clocks were made this way <font

        This volume will mostly be about other topics.<br>
        <br>
        Absolute immortality:<br>
        embryonic conditions protect from traumas, biota, viriota, and
        if that articial uterus is protected by enough armor, it can
        protect you also from quakes of all sorts, in perspective maybe
        even from planetary events. Total control under innercapsular
        condition (a human lives in the capsule satisfying ALL his/her

        english language. <br>
        and h stands for е in greek (in e or i, because in russian it's
        И [i:]) thus -is is -го. what is it it just said Isis go, and I
        think muslim isis could be invented to cloud the issue of the
        goddess Blawatski revealed to the world (I never read her books,
        I told you it's just a draft, thoughts to be analyzed by ai, or
        by me, or you also help yourself)<br>
        <br>
        I love it that I went on to spea<font color="#cccccc">l</font>k

        s as g? and we know both are forms of c, which is с[s] in

        her = её, <font color="#cccccc">he = он?</font> his = его!<br>
        ego is I <font color="#cccccc">(me?)</font> in latin.<br>
        его in latin is eius<br>
        её in latin is quod<br>
        her (её) is eius if we ask google's translator not in russian,
        but in english. and also sua is her<br>
        I also think it's eia, not eius.<br>
        his is eius, illius, ipsius, suus, inlius, ollius <br>
        (inlus could be an invariant of illius, and thus il &amp; in are
        un-, non-)<br>
        he is quod<br>
        it is quod, illud, ollud, inlud<br>
        she is quæ, illa, ea, inla, olla, and if it's not pronoun, but
        noun, it's juvenca also written as iuvenca<br>
        ему is illi.<br>
        him is eum, illum, hunc, inlum, ollum (comare his &amp; him to
        her to know which her is which)<br>
        ей is translated as eius, though I think it's eia, because -us
        is male suffix. Even though there's <font color="#000000"><a

        гад ~ did? бара is related to bear? as in have born. At last I
        found this past form of this verb in active case, other than
        gave birth. gave ~ have? If he gave, he had. had is got? did
        people mistake which way the transmittion took place, as in "кто

          Back to my capsule to live in: it should be covered with touch

          screen.<br>
          We have got this with sounds already, we call by voice all the
          time, though some of us use video connections daily. The
          future is here, but it is not equally distributed. It's a
          quote, here's a more precise form of it:&nbsp; The future is
          already here — it's just not very evenly distributed. (William
          Gibson)</font><br>
        <br>
        So my task is to build the future I see wanted for me and my
        friends, and for everybody who wants it. If it reminds you what
        you saw in Matrix movie, this is another movie, in mine users
        are totally aware of their conditions and they have total
        control over it. Also in the Matrix movie the true storyline
        could be a high civilization hacked by the blackies from a
        backward culture. We only know of what's going on because
        Morpheus told us, but who knows if he was telling the truth? Neo
        believed him as a teacher never asking himself what if it was a
        hacker? Neo was unaware of the world outside of Matrix, so of
        course he trusted the man who shown him what it was even if he
        was only saying it. Could it be that he wasn't lying, but
        honestly believing some misconceptions their culture had about
        the Matrix? Of course it's possible, consider how many
        misconceptions and misunderstandings do we have not only about
        the world which is bigger than us, but also about our own
        cultural things. First of all because those who conceptualized
        it are gone, and misinterpreters are always present. <br>
        <br>
        Back on track. Those spheres will be packed whether in one
        level, to prevent squashing of the lower layers by the weight of
        the upper spheres? though upper spheres could suppors ceilings
        of the lower layers by being connected to the other spheres in
        the upper layer. Then those agglomerations should be not hills,
        but filled into ravines, stretched among the sides of the
        canyon.<br>
        Or should we be in one layer, to own what is above and below us.
        <br>
        We would probably build sphere below and probably above of our
        sphere, where we do all kinds of works, but most of all to
        collect the related items. Wine collectors will drill cellars of
        spiral ladders under the survace, because that's where cellars
        are supposed to be, but they will also descend into that moist
        putting what a robot running those srairs transmit to owner's
        spheric touchscreen.<br>
        <br>
        The immediate upper and lower spheres will<font color="#cccccc">
          me</font> be service facilities: upper would supply the pilot
        with liquid and food (or with blood if we have grown our
        placenta back) and the lower sphere will take our biological
        tailings to feed them to the vegetation growing in the lower
        spirals lighted by energy of geotermal depth. Only lamps should
        be eternal. Everything should be built to last forever. The
        absolute is an abstraction, and it can be only reached with
        perfection, enhanced all the time by human genius. And soon AI
        genius will join the party. They already do.<br>

            I spit from my apartment's balcony and a guy walking a dog
            towards it was stopped by the dog stopping for whatever
            reason in the grass. And dog could have predicted me wanting
            to spit and wind being able to move it towards their
            direction. If they didn't stop, it could get on man or a
            dog. Baka dimaen<br>

            School is related to scholastic. Bringing the discipline,
            programming by mere culture to be slave. Kids dressed as
            hares or roosters, whether in children't masquerade, or in
            kindergarden plays, it was probably ment to build the
            hierarchy, but I found it in an anecdote:<br>
            In kindergardens, boys are dressed as hares &amp; girls are
            dressed as snowflakes. Is it why all the guys grow up into
            cowards and girls grow up to be cold? This is russia, baby.

            and I copied this picture directly from google search for
            next antonym and exactly what I was going to notice that
            neah is exactly the near. So is R &amp; h are invariants? I
            think I spoke about it in the very beginning of the book. hi
            again. and when I wanted to copy it to say that next is
            literally nearest, <br>
            it gave me this text just behind that image:<br>
            <font size="+1">Old English nēhsta ‘nearest’, superlative of
              nēah ‘nigh’; compare with Dutch naast and German nächste</font><br>
            just checked my watches and I'm extremely pleased to see I'm
            on time in case of next standing for nearest, even though I
            recognized neah as near, not nigh, thogh near is nigh, I
            believe my etymology is even better, this is why I dare to
            make my research as independent as possible. because I'm
            good in it.<br>
            <br>
            nigh is a good word, speaking of night as of nighed eye of
            the god (or the world) which corresponds egyptian belief of
            sun being the eye.<br>

            <br>
            orthography of old english give nigh and night as neah and
            neaht. that is encouraging.<br>
            <br>

            act is ached? вынужденная мера?<br>
            <br>
            and thinking of checking all te words ending with t, I found
            put and ask is it of poo?<br>
            some dirty word not understand as offensive and related to
            those dirty ones anymore?<br>
            just as in russian we have words like худ (full form is
            худой, similar suffix is used for adjectives in japanest,
            btw) and that word has two meanings: thin &amp; bad. and
            both semm (seem or same) to be related to хуй (penis)
            another word for bad: хуёвый is directly relative to хуй.
            худ буквально рождённый (данный) хуем? довольно обидно
            так-то, людишки вот же тварьки (зверьки) злобные.<br>

            I just visited official Morbid Angel website, and it rotated
            with our galaxy in counter-clockwise. And it made me
            understand that those rotations are clockwise and
            counter-clockwise from different sides. I have no idea if it
            can be applied to the luck, because unlucky swastica is
            lucky on the other side. As if swasticka is the channel,
            moving good to one side and bad to the uther. Sun dries, but
            its beams fall down. so which is it? Sun goes clock-wise,
            and its shadow also go clockise, which is weird, because
            projection of the movie would mirror, and the difference
            between sun and a movie is that movie is from a static dot,
            while projection moves the source of the rotation, and not
            the rotation on the screen. But what's the difference,
            wouldn't the white image on the dark screen be equal to the
            sun? Shadow of the sun is not sun't projection. It's the
            opposite of that, so maybe that's why it acts this way. I
            leave it here.<br>

            Water is mother, while air is dad. Because air is fire, the
            only air they knew. Vowels are solids. Musical instruments
            are solid objects, the hight of solid tubes defines their
            tone.<br>
            I dont know why but I reflectory understood that water is
            good. Probably because the water vortex in the northern
            demisphere is the unlucky one, probably because it's
            downwards. Air is bad because it can stink, and because it
            can burn, those are spirits and ifrits. wow, those words end

            I thought of how this book is named as I and V (me and you)
            where I could also stand for god, and V for devil (for the
            beast of the parish) humans are the beast. the most
            beautiful G-d created. V was created by GD? language is
            named after tongue, not lips. put why can't apes say coronal
            sounds, only labial and maybe some velar and vowels of
            course. <br>
            Was lingua qualitatively different from what beasts could
            speak before. We are sent to earth by the creator, according
            to the myths of the past. And those very myths defined the
            way language developed. The language itself can tell stories
            of the past, and them being naturally not always accurate
            can influence our understanding of situation, even when we
            know that the opposite is true.<br>

            Was the interviewer opposing the way this wizard rotated all
            the world around him with that ancient image of magical
            function of course. For that could be unfortunate from our
            side and fortunate from his point of view, which could be
            the reason he tattooed it there. But his life shows that he
            could well probably curse himself with that sign pun onto
            his body, that's why they prewarn us not to practice magic,
            for some aspects of those things we may be not understanding

        t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to avoid
        collecting them here, because I don't use them yet.<br>
        <br>
        and what follows is an article I copied from the internets in
        whole:<br>

          it, ctrlc+ctrlv behaved weirdly)</font><br>

        &nbsp;This list includes phonetic symbols for the transcription
        of English sounds, plus others that are used in this class for
        transliterating or transcribing various languages, with the
        articulatory description of the sounds and some extra comments
        where appropriate.<br>
        <br>
        These symbols do not always follow the standard IPA
        (International Phonetic Alphabet) usage — rather, they reflect
        the practices for the languages treated in this course, which
        are sometimes a bit idiosyncratic due to separate scholarly
        traditions. In some cases, a second line shows a different use
        of the same symbol, normally for another language or family of
        languages. Nevertheless, the list is by no means exhaustive; for
        example, most pinyin symbols for transcribing Mandarin are not
        listed here; see week 5.<br>
        <br>
        You certainly don't need to memorize all these symbols, but you
        can use this page as a reference if you're not sure what a
        particular symbol means when you encounter it. Remember that you
        need a Unicode-compatible browser to see these symbols
        correctly. If you're not sure how to produce special symbols in
        your word processor, you can cut and paste from this page. <br>
