      I shared that Kessler guy, because with all his flaws<font
        color="#cccccc"> (who's flawless here?)</font> it's an
      outstanding work, <font color="#cccccc">whether it is correct or
        not, </font>and it would be a bummer if it's lost, because it
      could be the biggest loss in that Fomenko scandal, when some
      historic works were made by mathematician and published in the
      most prominent soviet university and later historic department
      labelled them as pseudoscientific (look who's talking!) but
      failing to attach any constructive criticism to his work for at
      least three years (I was watching that situation closely) maybe
      even five (so long ago it was, that my memory is not sure about
      this digit in it) and only after let's say 3 to 5 years an
      engineer or a mathematician (memory also doubts what version is
      true) began public intellectual battle with Fomenko, and I wasn't
      able to follow their conversation, because whether their
      argumentations required some level of competence I didn't feel
      like achieving educating myself, or just the interest to this
      situation faded with time, because what the situation taught me is
      that fuck academia, those clerks don't know shit, so I was
      liberated to begin my work from scratch without leaning onto the
      academia speers. And the same rationalization could be beyond
      Kessler's attempt to group all the dictionary into lesser semantic
      groups without bringing reconstructed forms and structures made
      before them (they can always be wrong, and me personally, I don't
      believe in established language families, because of how russian
      and japanese are similar. If I want to preserve the family
      structure which is wide accepted today, I should attach japanese
      to slavic languages, but it would be so insane and actually why
      not to combine chinese to english because of some similarities? wo
      &amp; we and short words and simple grammar, that probably were
      the two huge branches we initially were on, but cross-culture
      communications made russian drift further from japanese and closer
      to english, just as japanese drifted towards chinese, so it's not
      a tree, but a jar of aminoacids the way I imagine it.<br>
      But after saying all that I decide to not dig into his theory
      until I develop my own dictionary and let it be better than his,
      with much less semantic clasters.<br>
      I dare to mention Fomenko more and more explicitly in these texts
      probably because I grew more hostile towards academia, but also
      because a friend of mine mentioned him as a freak not worth
      mentioning and I asked him why exactly doesn't he like what he
      said, and I couldn't receive a coherent answer to that, he simply
      accepted that academia is always right. Even though history of
      science here and again prove otherwise.<br>
      So about the freaks, we should distinguish between them: there are
      obvious freaks like Chudinov who's probably there to smear some
      authentic artifacts like that Bornholm alphabet runestone; then
      there are those freaks who are whether fools or trolls like
      Oreshkin; then there are some clinically insane freaks like
      Lukashevich. Those evaluations are purely subjective, but they
      allow to understand where I stand.<br>
      The other group of linguistic freaks are Vashkevich and Dragunkin,
      who pull some outrageous conclusions<font color="#999999"> (here I
        speak as an academic golem. I should be more specific. And more
        specific is that they claim that one nations were born by the
        others: Dragunking writes that japanese language is spawn of
        russian, which is rather outrageous, but should be explored why
        does he think it is, it could be hidden in the folds of his
        texts, where I haven't looked. Vashkevich writes that russian
        language itself is a spawn of arabic, which is even more
        outrageous, but doesn't contradict the previous claim made by
        his colleague)</font> out of their observations, but the
      observations itself may be rather useful for those who learn
      foreign languages (Vashkevich compare arabic words to greek,
      russian and whatever else, I didn't even read him<font
        color="#999999"> (and now I did and he's not as bad as his fans
        sang me: I just had a look into thi<a
          href="http://nnvashkevich.narod.ru/ZHZN/facila.htm"><font
            color="#999999">s t</font></a>ext about bees and I found it
        rather fascinating, even though I stumbled at how he connected
        bee to comma, but then I understood that thus he united several
        "dictionary articles" into one рассказ, because fasila sounds as
        russian пчела, but here's where academic minds lose him <font
          color="#cccccc">(loose him)</font> because that link is rather
        weak to be called etymologic, even though then he brings some
        additional links in the form of that other comma standing at the
        sixth position looks somewhat like inverted 6, but hardly <font
          color="#cccccc">m</font>any peer-reviewers have passed through
        that one freaky part. But to speak seriously, he uses
        associative thought which is pretty much the opposite of the
        abstract thought more commonly used in science, thus his work
        can be some form of poetry, some mnemonic stories at best, but
        seriously it's not science) </font>Dragunkin compares russian
      to japanese and to english. All that can be incredibly useful as
      mnemonic tools. <font color="#999999">upd: I read some of
        Vashkevich, he's way freakier than Dragunkin <font
          color="#cccccc">(here I spoke after I read what his fans
          write, I'm such a prick sometimes. as I said before, I read
          some of it, and he's not far from Dragunkin, he's actually
          interesing (until he goes way too far and you get enough of
          that crap) and I forgot how awkwardly childish Dragunkin's
          rants can be. look who's speaking! yeah, free minds are
          freaky, are they in free key)</font> so freakery is some range

        (more abstract) than Vashkevich's associative mnemonic stories)
      </font><br>
      Fomenko also belongs to that second group of semi-correct
      scientific marginals, and the most prominent reason of his
      theories not being taken seriously (I'm not even talking of them
      being accepted) is that he doesn't have education of a historian.
      <font color="#999999">(but Vashkevich not only has some linguistic
        education, he also has some scientific degree in the field,
        which doesn't stop him from making some not exactly
        scientifically acceptable propositions) this chapter is на
        заплате заплата, а потому я перепишу его начисто когда-нибудь.</font>
      But seriously, if prominent mathematicians use some previously
      published tools and models to the structure of historic data, that
      alone demands a proper outlook from scientific society, which
      didn't happen when he was relatively alright, and now there's even
      less chance of that being done properly, for that guy whether went
      trolling or was sold out or whatver happened to him, that the
      level of his scientific thought dropped from mathematical
      modelling to mere speculations. Or it could be because it's easier
      to notice what is wrong with the state of affair happening at the
      moment, but one has ever-growing tendency to fall short when (s)he
      tries to describe as it was or what's supposed to be done in the
      future. Me myself, I'm definitely in that second group of freaks,
      and some of my assumptions are probably dead wrong, but those main
      elements of this theory the structures and some other findings may
      persist and sustain. And I actually <font color="#cccccc">except
        (</font>expect<font color="#cccccc"> to accept)</font> some
      academic recognition in the following three years or so. Even
      though I was recently told that <font size="+1">Ignaz Semmelweis
        was disregarded for awhile because MDs are psychopaths: see
        Semmelweis effect. Gregor Mendel's founding of genetics was
        completely ignored for thirty something years </font>I began
      that path believing that anything can be achieved in mere ten
      years, also they say history goes faster than before, so I expect
      it to take society ten years to recognize what it's all about. And
      it's been over six years now since I went public, so..<br>

        alright, some of them are very alright (who?), but i don't know
        any very alright individual in linguistics, even myself is too
        weird to be a king, and above whom? fuck them, gosh. But they
