          what they've conceptualized about them may make us respect
          them somewhat less. Though soil, not air is the more common
          among elemental systems, what if it's the both. Air is the
          product of the earth, without the soil there would be no air.
          And ש is the chaotic energy which is some other force, and it
          makes us guests from space? Otherwise we would be the Earth
          itself. And are we not? We ARE! water is also earth? if air is
          earth, water is also earth. Isn't fire from within (and from

          And I go on with my research: <br>
          Х ~ Ж if we recognize X as stavless Ж, ᚷ as stavless ᚼ<br>
          Also because J can be read as Ж [j] in french, but as ᚷ [h] in
          spanish<br>
          And position of russian Ж correlate greek H (and Z is after
          it, not in front as in greek. So does it make greek later
          relating to russian? In russian second row Z stands in the
          end, not in the front, but do russians have F after E? No, but
          Ё. (I spoke about it whether in this version or look for older
          ones in web archive)<br>
          <br>
          ᚷ as stavless ᚼ exp;ains hot ~ жара and makes me believe
          that's the same t as in to, which comes ть in russian &amp; る
          in japanese. (I)t seems to come ra in russian, while in verbs

          I think I found my H, as bekar after b, notice how ♮ resembles

          Surprise is that in my own city lives another kid who've found
          something incredible in russian alphabet:<br>
          <a href="https://roouh.livejournal.com/133411.html"><img
              src="III_files/58102_800.png" alt="" height="139"

          <br>
          We see K breaking sequence once again (does it mean it wasn't
          tabooed, it wasn't invented in those ancient abecedarias of
          some archaic latin <font color="#999999">(I'm not sure that
            period is named archaic, you look it up yourself if you care
            of the exact taxonomy)</font><br>
          Also П can be an invariant of R which would go farting (the
          sound only some most ancient native americans lost in the
          jungle speak this sound. That 3-vowel tribe, I wrote about
          them, I don't remember the name.<br>
          This sequence of voiced-sonors-voiceless. Is not present in
          english, but we know that G is invariant of C and that C used
          to sound like G, at least I read it. <br>
          It is arranged as if students begin loud and clear in voiced
          forms of the letters, but getting tired their voices became
          less clear until it switched off completely and only wisper
          would come out. O &amp; especially У are way more tired than A
          &amp; E, vowels could also influence the enthusiasm of
          pronunciation. So it could be either appear this way
          naturally, or be arranged this way to ease the reading of the
          alphabet. <br>
          Let's see if such a sequence is present in any of other

            they're untuned by insertion of K and originally there was
            no K &amp; they all were voiced. Then R is also out of
            sequence, and as K &amp; R are graphically similar, it seems
            we found another key to this clockwork, for I always
            wondered how could it be that P is R in russian? Bornholm

          is somewhere near greek: <br>
          the only difference is that postionian greek doesn't see H as
          [h]<br>
          and that hebrew includes some additional letters (surprise!)
          but <br>
          they are voiceless, so who knows maybe it tells that they
          follow <br>
          this voiced-voicelss tendency more.<br>
          <br>
          So is it just a coincidence, which became quasi-structure in
          one<br>
          of them, or is it common among all of them one way or another.<br>
          I would look for some structural tendency if latin shows no<br>
          tendency of having more voiced in the first half.<br>
          <br>
          But P instead of B, T instead of D, I think this
          voiced-voiceless is set from the initial ABD/VFH <br>
          but let's conduct the experiment:<br>
          <br>
          A <font color="#ff0000">B</font> <font color="#33cc00">C</font>
          <font color="#ff0000">D</font> E <font color="#33cc00">F</font>

          <br>
          Еven in latin second half has more voiceless letters, but it's
          on the brink of losing this tendency completely:<br>
          First half contains 4 voiceless: CFHK<br>
          Second half contains 5 voiceless: PQSTX <font color="#cccccc">(even

































            though the second half as we broke it is 2 letters shorter)</font><br>
          And if we cound voiced, then <br>
          First half contains 7 voiced: BDGJLMN<br>
          Second half contains 5 voiced: RVWYZ (and if we count VW as 1
          &amp; Y as vowel, even less: 3)<br>
          But if we remember that LMN are the beginning of the second
          half of the alphabet (as official etymology of "element"
          tells) then it's only 4 voiced in the first half, and even if
          we exclude W &amp; Y it's 6 against 4, which breaks the
          tendency. <br>

          well, in this case first half has 5 voiced, and the second -
          only 4 (but if we turn W back on?)<br>
          <br>
          It could also happen this way in latin because of some reform
          of sharing the voiced through the structure, not to make the
          pyramid way to obvious that bottom doesn't have a say.<br>
          <br>
          Anyway, latin is an exception among those I've seen above,
          let's look into georgian alphabet, to see if it's just some
          hellenic fluctuation or some truer symmetry, which could be
          cause by BD PT of some ancient unknown alphabet, mama first
          papa second, baba dada also go this way, and if some southern
          nations call papa baba, this deserves its own research.<br>
          <br>
          The reason I throw away R &amp; not P is because the grapheme
          P is known in both latin &amp; russian <font color="#666666">&amp;

































            greek,</font> while R is only in latin. Also cursive k is
          even more similar to R than K and we need P as labial in our
          common structure of ABCD (notice that ABC also has voiced
          before voiceless) <br>
          then russians have П but no Р (could russian Р be invariant of
          П as if it's voiced form, even though it wasn't voice but
          bright vibration of lips. So could be R voiceless too (then we
          don't have to exclude it here) for it's brightness is not
          necessary on vocal cords, for it comes from tongue &amp;
          alveols?<br>

          Surprisingly, in georgian voiced-voiceless tendency is less
          preserved than even in greek &amp; hebrew <br>
          <font color="#cccccc">(or is it, on contrary, promoted) </font>for

































          not only R but several other voiced letters appear in the
          second half.<br>
          Still it's more obvious than in latin, especially if we split
          it as it is, however we break it the most of voiceless are in
          the second half. But if M is the central letter, both halves
          have the same ammount of voiced.<br>
          <br>
          In conclusion to this paragraph I have to say that this
          tendency is definitely present, but if it's artificially
          conceived or has it occured naturally this is almost
          impossible to say, probably reformers of russian alphabet
          noticed this tendency and fostered it a little.<br>
          <br>
          This tendency also supports the idea of russian В being placed
          in the place of F, for it could be voiced before, they say it
          used to be W - semitic vav is voiced. And В looks like θ which
          used to belong somethere.<br>
          <br>
          Let's look at all of the sudden spectacular russian if we
          consider Р [r] voiceless (whisper of r is r)<br>

            it's only K out of structure. And the border exactly where

          just as I couldn't figure out the ancient linguistic
          understanding of linguals (made by tongue) wandering among
          alveolar, dental, so was that guy mislead by knowing too much.
          Sonors, huh.<br>
          Though If I understand Р <font color="#cccccc">(Russian R
            looks like P)</font> as voiceless because it's whispering
          has no pair, and thus voiceless M is also M. while voiceless
          BDGJVZ are PTKCFS <font color="#cccccc">(C here is Ch, for
            only K is always K)</font> <br>

          was it logic of those who placed sonors among voiced &amp;
          voiceless? let's look at those sonors:<br>

          <br>
          and in halves:<br>

            color="#ff0000">Ж З</font> И <font color="#3333ff">Й</font>

          <br>
          and I was thinking the other day: " what if Ф is initial form
          of P, because there's no Ф in latin, but that's not what my
          thought began with. I began with looking at runic labials: ᛒᚠᛉ
          and even ᚢ all are dual. except P, which is neither in the
          bornolm runic alphabet (named by von List as armanen runes) <br>
          So what if these two rows are voiced &amp; voiceless and as
          genomic apparatus checks for mutations comparing two strings,
          we can reconstruct earlier phonetics of those alphabetic
          signs.<br>

          <br>
          There's now now labial after У, but only because there's no
          labial after EЁ <br>
          but it's F after E, and it's Ф after У<br>
          but Ф is already used. but what's use of the two voiced after
          O? Ф may be used instead of P, then why П?<br>
          let's look at latin once again:<br>
          <br>
          A <font color="#ff0000">B</font> <font color="#33cc00">C</font>
          <font color="#ff0000">D</font> E <font color="#33cc00">F</font>

          <br>
          most of the voiced mess is in the final line (we russians have
          all final line of vowels, what is your voiced)<br>
          so let's look at it in the ancient form:<br>
          <br>

          </font><br>
          V could reflect F for some reason: Vav is voiced F, V is read
          as F in german: von sounds as fon.<br>

          </font><br>
          what is it? two octaves? but they're in sixs, not sevens.
          could it be related to 6 being so popular among heathens? Are
          those 6 reformed pentatonica? Then 7th note would be the
          further reform (maybe even from some other confession)<br>
          So what was the initial form of those two "octaves"<br>
          <br>

          Ф is long P, double P. <font color="#cccccc">(B is read as V

          so now there's 8 of them. could it be where the word octave
          comes from?<br>
          <br>
          now these two lines are in abcd mode. let's look if they can
          be in axial:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <font color="#ff0000"><br>
            &nbsp; B&nbsp;</font> <font color="#ff0000">G</font> <br>
          <font color="#ff0000">D</font>&nbsp; O&nbsp; <font
            color="#33cc00"><font color="#33cc00">Ф</font> <br>
            &nbsp; Q</font><font color="#33cc00">&nbsp; T</font><br>
          <br>
          actually yes. and V is envoked by it.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <font color="#ff0000"><br>
            &nbsp; B&nbsp;</font> <font color="#ff0000">G</font> <br>
          <font color="#ff0000">D</font>&nbsp; O&nbsp; <font
            color="#33cc00"><font color="#33cc00">P</font> <br>
            &nbsp; Q</font><font color="#33cc00">&nbsp; T</font><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Shouldn't I make up my mind if V is labial consonant or vowel?
          But it is both, in different cultures it's both, and sometimes
          it's in the same culture both (as vav in semitic languages,
          even though both lineal &amp; axial symmetries recognize vav
          as labial consonant, and maybe that's why both و &amp; ו stand
          for "&amp;" and both are consonant labials: و is wъ, ו is v,
          and we can see that more modern arabic has drifted more
          towards vowel u, and today ו can be used also for u &amp; o,
          but to make it o (literally "or") we have to put aleph before
          it: או, which reminds me of יהוה being transliterated as Io,
          which reminds both greek deity (and I'm not exactly sure it's
          the same Io whose priestess invented alphabet, but wth, of
          course it's her) and polynesian highest deity of a cult very
          similar to judaism, I think I've already wrote about it, and I
          think I wrote that ה makes ' &amp; ו vowels, but isn't י vowel
          by default? Those who know hebrew probably laugh at me right
          now.<br>
          <br>
          that abgd-opqt pair keeps v vowel, and yet I'm not sure this
          reconstruction reconstructs any representation actually
          existing in the past, roouh begins with one ancient russian
          abecedary, and look at it, it breaks the alphabet in half
          exactly between voiced &amp; voiceless (wonderful thing is
          that k is missing, and it doesn't seem to have enough space
          for k:<br>

          voiced-voiceless order is the original one (it's more present
          in hebrew, than it is in latin, and it is somewhat general
          that voiced tend to gather in the beginning of the alphabet (B
          is voiced, K is not, so now let's look how it is in eastern
          ones:<br>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hentaigana"><img
              src="III_files/Hentaigana.png" alt="" height="607"
              border="0" width="1009"></a><br>
          <br>
          they all are voiceless by default and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakuten_and_handakuten">゛</a>
          makes it voiced (only the sonor ones are voiced already: m, n,
          l/r<br>
          wait a minute, there are more of those: it goes a ka sa ta na
          ha ma ya ra wa n<br>
          <br>

            width="502"><br>
          <br>
          so it's definitely voiceless (those to which ゛ can be applied)
          in the front, sonors (voiced by default) in the back. it
          breaks between ta &amp; na &amp; only ha goes exceptional, and
          it is exceptional, because it can be applied with&nbsp; ﾟ to
          make p- but it's b when ゛ is on it's right upper corner, but
          it's more funny than this, because that ha is more weird than
          that: it's wa most of the time: boku wa baka gaijin desu,
          sumimasen, this wa is actually that very ha, so if it's wrong
          that it's ha or not, it's exceptional, and other than that
          mayarawan are all sonors, and kasata are once again remind
          second half of the first raw: as if ha was replaced from it's
          honorable position. ahakasata - is it how it was? because I
          was already seeing things like aka satana (akai is red in
          japanese, and -i suffix is the same as russians use for
          adjectives, and russians sometimes just don't use that suffix
          to create so called "short adjectives" which may tell that
          adjectives are as ancient as nouns and verbs. red can be even
          more primal than raid. <br>
          <br>
          But back on track, what I wanted to say is<br>
          <font size="+2"><font size="+2">א<font color="#ff0000"> ב ג ד

          as four representations of the same two letters, as
          sillabaries do, but this time with only 4 vowels &amp; 2
          consonants, even before 5 vowels, B and T<br>
          You can notice that this way they're grouped according to IPA
          into plosive, fricative, nasal, whisper. <font
            color="#cccccc">IPA puts B&amp;D in the same group, and
            D&amp;T too, so I named those voiceless whispers by miself.
          </font>Which may witness something about the jewish vowels
          themselves. Is O a wisper form of A? Because <font size="+2"><font
              size="+2">ע</font></font> is related to O. It could be
          more related to У, but it stands at O position. Though if we
          compare the final line of jewish alphabet with У line, we get
          У as <font size="+2"><font size="+2">ע</font></font> and Ф as
          <font size="+2"><font size="+2">פ</font></font> which is
          direct transliteration and Х as <font size="+2"><font
              size="+2">צ</font></font> which is weird, though cursive <font
            size="+2"><font size="+2">צ</font></font> looks like З
          (there's no unicode for cursive, so watch it up in that .odo
          addon) and initial X does sound like Z. Ц as <font size="+2"><font
              size="+2">ק</font></font> which is equally weird, though C
          could stand for both, Ч for <font size="+2"><font size="+2">ר</font></font>
          which is quite a coincidence, because cursive ч looks exactly
          like cursive r - is it why they call it cursive? as of curse,

          because we don't have these two in russian (is it an argument
          enough? but what if russians had alphabetic canon before
          christians, and though I only shyly attempted to notice this
          possibility (because they were caught redhanded in this sort
          of crime of claiming authority over something they didn't
          author)<br>
          after that it was clear that&nbsp; has to go (because bornholm
          alphabet's first row only has ᛒᚦ instead of BCD, because of b
          d symmetry shining on so many levels: BD, БД, ⰂⰄ, 𓃀𓂧 and
          even <font size="+2"><font size="+2">בד</font></font> are
          probably here, but сСГⰃ(𓈎𓎡𓎼)ג never plays this game, which
          makes me think it should go from the protoalphabet (it also
          didn't exist in that mythic 5 vowels, B &amp; T, and also only
          latin alphabet has velar column distinctly, unlike the others)<br>
          I knew M had to go first, an we still have N following, which
          marks L as invariant of I further in history than N as
          invariant of I (И) if it even is, for if it is, M must be an
          invariant of И too, which would be super weird, because I is
          lingual, and M is labial. but AIU correlate AMT if you even
          know what I mean, I think it's one of those moments when I'm
          so high in that depth, that even me won't be able to make
          sense of this.<br>
          So here I already had a distinct pattern, so to determine
          which of many voiceless sounds of the fourth and final row go
          into my reconstruction of protoalphabet wasn't difficult at
          all. P &amp; T of course. which is kinda sad, because I

      Roman secunda is 24 times longer than ours<br>
      Does it mean one hour in their system was a term for a day? <br>
      Година is hour in ukrainian, but year in russian: год is year to
      be precise, so russians would understand година as год.<br>
      Is it why "сейчас" (now) is more likely to mean "сегодня, сего
      дня" (today) than "сей час" (this hour, tohour) - well, no, сейчас
      сегодня собраны по одному принципу. сей и сего - просто в разных
      падежах. Но разве разница в падежах не являет иную грамматическую
      форму? если бы их собирали одновременно, то сейчас, сейдень.
      "Сегодня" более изысканно флектуатическая структура, а значит она
      с некоторой вероятностью была собрана позже, потому что "сейчас"
      это китайцы так слова собирают, а они законсервировали грамматику
      на самом раннем этапе из всех что я знаю. И я считаю что это
      свидетельствует о древности их письменности и языка. Could

      у- stands for something like away (and for way in "way (too big)")

      go in russsin: иди) and there probably were some other examples. I

                  definitions, reconstructions &amp; divisions into
                  families or whatever. And then maybe even other
                  animals' languages will be compared with ours.</span></span></span></span></span></span>

      is also alphabetic if you watch at the first letters in the
      groups:<br>

        color="#ff0000">ی</font><br>
      <br>
      all I was going to say is <font color="#ff0000">ه</font> و look
      like E F when they're written in a different font: <font
        color="#ff0000">ه</font>و<br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">(you should try to type mixing hebrew or
        arabic with latin or russian, it's a mindf</font><br>
      <br>
      Notice that having removed the doublets, we got ourselves 18
      letters, which is a magic number of 3 sects<br>
      (sects are aettir but of 6s)<br>
      sso is 6s &amp; 8s the same old war for geometric forms (arabs
      adore 8-poiinted star (it's united) while jews prefer 6-pointed
      star (it's separated) <br>
      6-pointed star is probably historically more ancient (it's both
      less points, 18-letter alphabets are older than 24-letter ones,
      judaism is older than islam) but 8-pointed is also a cross. and
      sun shines mostly across (but it's because of the effect our
      eyelashes create (because sun rotates together with our head, and
      the cross is seen when eyes are half-closed, otherwise sun goes
      all the way)<br>
      <br>
      The idea of separation of the alphabet into voiced &amp; voiceless
      can be used as an instrument to deliver the previous form of the
      alphabet:<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#ff0000">ا</font> <font color="#3366ff">ب</font> ج د
      ر س ص ط <font color="#ff0000">ع</font><font color="#3366ff"> ف</font>
      ق ک ل <font color="#3366ff"> م</font> <font color="#000099">ن</font>
      <font color="#ff0000">ه</font> <font color="#33ffff">و</font> <font
        color="#ff0000">ی</font><br>
      <br>
      First I noticed that this way we have vowels in the end (as
      russians coplete it, as greeks had omega, as runic alphabet had ᚢ
      (v, u (oo)) and roman alphabet had V, v (v, u) and russian
      alphabet had Ѵ, ѵ as finals)<br>
      And just before those vowels ن [n] stands and in greek minuscule
      [n] is <span title="Greek language text" lang="el">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        <span title="Greek language text" lang="el">ν</span></span><br>
      and after jewish <font size="+2"><font size="+2">נ</font></font>
      [n] stands <font size="+2">ס</font> which looks just like ه -
      could there be some cultureal correlation (and the script is of
      the same size, but hebrew is extra large in the text, otherwise it
      was really small, and arabic is in normal size (as is all this
      text) let's make it extra extra large and compare them:<br>
      <font color="#ff0000" size="+3">ا</font><font size="+3"> <font

        ن ه و ی</font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size="+3">ه</font> stands where <font size="+2">ס</font>
      does. and they look the same, and I hate to diss your concealium,
      consealium, what is the word.. concilium, but I must notice that
      after n o fololows, and it looks exactly like <font size="+3">ه</font>
      and <font size="+2">ס</font> especially if you know they're
      backwards. So who's reading those texts wrong all the time?<br>
      <font size="+3">ه</font> is definitely closer to o than <font
        size="+2">ס</font>, especially if you transliterate it into
      jewish <font size="+2"><font size="+2">ה</font></font> which
      stands where e does, not o. but in arabic even though <font
        size="+3">ه</font> is closer to vowers than <font size="+2">ס</font>
      is, which also reminds greek σ - which resembles o just
      strikingly! and σ has it's own story of how Σ looks like E and
      that school=ecole, student=etudiant, and some more examples of the
      kind there is. scream just gets rid of s or e, and it's <span
        class="gt-baf-cell gt-baf-word-clickable">

            and even though it's not greek, but french, just as sign
            languages don't correlate speaking languages, so writing
            systems can be not corresponding with the languages they're
            used for, hence this babelonian mess I'm disentangling here.<br>
          </span></span></span><br>
      and ◯ could be a holy symbol, named by different nations
      differently, and thus... just a speculation<br>
      but if <font size="+3"> ه</font> is sun, <font size="+3">و</font>
      can be the moon<br>
      and they stand together in the second row, where E &amp; F do, and
      F is moon, because it's not always full.<br>
      and F is connected with fornication, and moon is the night, which
      is more proper for sex, and it's literally 6<br>
      and 6 looks like <font size="+3">و</font>, though 9 would fit
      more. And if we count it backwards from <font size="+3">و</font>,
      we may find that if <font size="+3">و</font> is 9, then 1 is <font
        size="+3">ع</font> which opens the second half of the alphabet,
      only it not begins, but ends with LMN. And it's 10 of them in that
      second half, and the first half is of 8, and if we abruptly
      exclude 9 &amp; 10 from the second half, we'll get alphabet of 16,
      as that "younger futhark" - I believe it's literally younger than
      it's older form, like when the system wasn't developed enough,
      when it was young. see the mindf/?&nbsp; <br>
      and the final letter looks like 。 which is as ◯ named maru. and 。
      is japanese . and dot is how one of ugaritic alphabets end (I
      never saw the artefact they took it from, but it's there, in their
      literature, I guess. <br>
      <img src="III_files/ugaritic.png" alt="" height="600" width="1163"><br>
      So if <font size="+3"> ه</font> is a dot, <font size="+3">و</font>&nbsp;




















      can be a comma. And whatever <font size="+3">ی</font> is, it can
      be wind if <font size="+3"> ه</font> and <font size="+3">و</font>&nbsp;




















      are sun &amp; moon. <br>
      (in one russian fairytail a prince asked from sun, from moon &amp;
      from the wind. Are that another representation of trinity? saint
      spirit is similar to wind. but son as sun seems to be related as
      heresy by older religions, father is the king, that's the old
      order, son only transmits its will (even when king is dead, he was
      deity ever-living), then son is not sun, but moon, man he is.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">But back on track, why don't I go further
        and don't compare <font size="+3">ع</font> to three? why stop
        where it's convenient? have I ever stopped? then I'd call <font
          size="+3">ا</font> the 1, then I'd see nothing better than to
        name <font size="+3">ج</font> the 2? then <font size="+3">ط</font>
        the four? nah... though I think I saw something of the kind
        somewhere (here I wanted to dig deeper, but no, this path, if it
        even exists is still too early for me, I've already bought books
        on history of numbers, so I must read them, but I have so many
        thing to do, so I must go on train to make myself read.) </font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="+3">و</font>&nbsp; can be a comma especially because
      it stands for "and" <br>
      <br>
      LMN ending the alphabet makes another sense because it ends it
      with aMeN<br>
      and alumin is a joking mocking of аминь, but that as I heard it,
      aluminum was considered the most precious until we figured out how
      to extract it. alumni is also a word meaning of which I still
      don't know... <br>

      But let me finish this topic before I go away:<br>

        ه <font color="#ff0000">و</font> ی</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
        color="#cccccc">(red are voiced, green are voiceless)</font><br>
      First i wanted to guess that <font color="#33cc00" size="+3">س ص
        ط</font> are some ignorant extras, so applying that
      voiced-voiceless thing we can replace them and<font size="+3"> <font
          color="#ff0000">ل م ن</font> ه <font color="#ff0000">و</font>
        ی</font>&nbsp; too, but now I see: what if their structure was
      to keep silents inside and voiced outside? Doesn't it make sense?
      It does. So hail diversity, or something, let all the flowers
      bloom, some of them may happen to be of youth and you don't know
      which (use, not youth, but I cherish typos, and this one can be
      exactly right: some flowers can be of youth, and we don't know
      which. and even when we gain the eternal youth, those flowers
      still can be of use to us in the eternal future it's for sure) <br>
      <br>
      Why did I remove all those dotted invariants? Because inclusion of
      those ones disrupts the structures in european alphabet, ancient
      texts are reported to include no dots. at least in hebrew, I'm not
      sure of runes.<br>
      <br>
      I think I already mentioned it somewhere before, but this sequence
      also has la<font color="#33ccff">b</font>ials after v<font
        color="#ff0000">o</font>wels:<br>
      &nbsp;<font color="#ff0000" size="+3">ا</font><font size="+3"> <font

        <font color="#33ccff">و</font> <font color="#ff0000">ی</font></font><br>
      and again <font size="+3">م</font> is the exception, yet even <font
        size="+3">و</font> is preceded by <font size="+3">ه</font>,
      which makes me think that <font size="+3">ی</font> could be
      lingual y before. As if this sequence was before. hm.. anyway if <font
        size="+3">ی</font> is vowel in that end, it puts him along with
      greek. Though that shout.. shourt.. short like ..line is weird,
      the same is in gu.. ugaritic. I'm also hungry now, goeedbye...
      notice how that very i-line is collected in the end, as if it's
      the newest, the most disrupted too.<br>
      <br>
      Notice, that <font size="+3">ه</font> isn't actually vowel in
      modern arabic, and <font size="+3">ی</font> can be shortened to
      й, the [j] and only <font size="+3">ا</font><font size="+3"> </font>and<font
        size="+3"> ع</font> are always vowels. <font size="+3">و</font>&nbsp;




















      too can be vowel, but just as <font size="+3">ی</font>, not
      always, so these final two also make a pair, a pair of
      semi-vowels. and <font size="+3">ه</font> is probably one of
      them, though it's never vowel in arabic, it's always vowel in
      hebrew, and always vowel in greek, latin, and all the others
      actually.<br>
      <br>
      I didn't find much when I looked for <font size="+3">ع</font>
      being the same sign as 3, but it's also the same sign as E. And
      both are followed with fey, and b is for бог/ so are these just
      male &amp; female pairs (which makes sense: women historically
      (and actually physiologically) had less voice (half of that of a
      man in shariah court) and yet vowels were named female letters,
      and females managed to have more vowels, and more letters than man
      (as they have bigger attention to nuances, just as they have names
      for more colours than guys usually do) and more labials are on
      their side (the ratio is the same as with vowels. And isn't it the
      answer to why there are three mothers, but four or five labials? B
      is Babushka, the Granny (B &amp; G the same again. Бог Господь)<br>
      Granny can be kinder than mother, because she's way less disturbed
      with freudian bs, and mothers often have no idea how to treat
      their children, once again, it's just a speculation, something can
      happen out of it, I have long went into draft mode, if you want
      something more certain you should probably stick to the first
      volume, and even there be cautious of my usual liberties. Feя,
      Mother, Vulva? I'm only guessing, looking for the most female
      words. Female, Fe in that word plays the same role as Wo in Women.
      Here Wo sounds as We probably because We is actually a plural form
      of Wo () which tells a story of that word being of female origin.

        Интересной особенностью чукотского языка является то, что
        женщины и мужчины говорят по-разному. Для женщин существует табу
        на произнесение имён родственников мужа и похоже звучащих
        слов[5]. Разница существует также и в произношении обычных слов.
        Там, где мужчины произносят звук «р» или сочетание «рк», женщины
        произносят звук «ц» или «цц». Например, «морж» в мужском
        произношении звучит как «рыркы», а в женском — как «цыццы»[6].
        Другие примеры: мужчинами произносится ч, женщинами — ц:
        чайвыгыргын (муж.), цайвыгыццын (жен.) (в предложении
        Чайвыгыргын мыгитэгъэн! / Цайвыгыццын мыгитэгъэн!) или
        чайвыгыргын рэгитэӈэ (муж.) — цайвыгыццын цэгитэӈэ (жен.); «с»
        также может заменяться на «ц»: мылгынутэсӄык панрэвкы (муж.) —
        мылгынутэцӄык панцэвкы (жен.) (в предложении Тыӄэӈавытыйӈын
        мылгынутэсӄык панрэвкы вальык нымӈиӄин / Тыӄэӈавытыйӈын

      но где-то эта третья форма использовалась для второго лица? ты!
      да, это не вежливо, но до сих пор иногда применяется, когда тыкают
      в человека пальцем и спрашивают у него "он что думал?"<br>
      H is in переменном ряду (в разных алфавитах он по разному себя
      ведёт, иногда этой буквы нет)<br>
      Зная форму рунической ᚷ которая может быть staveless ᚼ&nbsp;
      предполагаю что h в русском стала ж, как дж в английском где в
      испанском что-то типа х. Но скорей всего наоборот, в русском она
      сохранена чётче (h стоит в столбце переднеязычных (coronal) что
      говорит что она скорее ʃ чем h.<br>
      Что делает he &amp; she инвариантами, и помимо Бьорк поющей шуман
      вместо хуман, вчера слышал песню, где парень пел she там где по
      сюжету было he. что же это была за песня? а, да, самое начало
      альбома Genius/GZA "Liquid Swords" - когда маленький (и возможно
      беззубый) пацан рассказывает про своего отца, говорит he так
      словно это she. She - шепелявая (беззубая) форма he.<br>
      Но тогда he первична, что противоречит тому что я только что
      городил: dh<br>
      <br>
      ا ب پ ت ث ج چ ح خ د ذ ر ز ژ س ش ص ض ط ظ ع غ ف ق ک گ ل م ن ه و ی<br>
      <br>
      ه often looks like e, and in alphabetic symmetry ه<br>
      stands where e does. <br>
      Thus a bigger idea: what if we recognize all alphabet as
      representations of the same system, and compare letters to
      recognize their true semantic value:<br>
      <font color="#ff0000">A</font> may look as an ox (as phoenicians <font
        color="#cccccc">(phoeniciantists)</font> recognize them, but A
      &amp; 𐤀 are the closest forms, when we compare it to hebrew and
      arabic, it's somewhat different: ا of hebrew directly stands for 1
      and if you think what it can be, it's a vertical figure without
      many branches, it's a man.<br>
      but if you compare it to hebrew form, to there are two hebrew
      forms: cursive form is very related to 𐤀<br>
      (I couldn't find hebrew cursive in the unicode. I think I should
      look for it in fonts... use images for now)<br>

      <br>
      once again, I missed a thought:<br>
      ه often looks like e, and in alphabetic symmetry ه<br>
      stands where e does. though eee looks like ههه<br>
      but also M looks like that: م <br>
      Мmm looks like that: ممم<br>

      3-unit is thiangle. That A &amp; 𐤀 could stand for it, but the
      thought was that ا is one and <font size="+2"><font size="+2">א</font></font>
      shows solar swastika, which make that figure not man, but god. And
      here again pronouns collapse (or do they merge) with deities. (I
      &amp; I where one is me, and the other is god) it explains why A
      looks like masonic pyramid. and 𐤀 does keep this slope, and is
      that curve a ray of light? and what is modern cursive hebrew?
      further decay of that glyph or something bigger than mere mistake?
      are they axis of the earth &amp; crescent? <a

      as if 刀 is t and か is k and then compare k to ᚳ [k (or tʃ)] which
      is probably the cognate of ᛏ [t] ᛐ (the same t) and ᛚ [l] <br>
      ᛐ could be some form of ᛏ when all ᛚ is taken out of it, and <br>
      <br>
      ᚳ [k (or tʃ)] is probably the same k of ᚴ, because in Bornholm

      represents those 7 greek vowels as a part of the talisman. I only
      wonder what is the sevens triad on the other side (5 types of
      animals could correspond the initial 5 vowels, 6th triad could be
      the celestial bodies, but what's the 7th?) for I noticed triads in
      them in egyptian alphabet: 3 birds, 3 types of animals, 3 body
      parts, 3 parts of a circle (whole, half, quarter. and those other
      forms are in the same relation: a big, a middle, a small) anyway
      what is the fifth triad in egyptial alphabet?<br>

      Russian and English have very similar alphabets, Greek &amp; Latin
      are very alike.<br>
      So how could it happen that they have different understanding of
      the same symbols?<br>
      Why и can be written as u in russian cursive, but и [i]<br>
      Why p is read as coronal R in Russi?<br>
      Why c is sometimes s sometimes k - but this one is another thing,
      I think s is a palatalised k ~ h ~ ш<br>
      as japanese palatalised s is understood as s by some, but as sh by
      others, when it's actually sch, щ<br>
      (that swash at the right bottom corner of that щ is palatalization
      of ш - tatar alphabet has more of them.<br>

      here you can see how clasters tend to group <font color="#cccccc">(compare










        this tatar alphabet to russian, on the base of which it was

      the following one uses another tradition: clumping them all in the

      <br>

      I'm not even sure it's palatalization, just some method to form
      invariants russians used once or so.<br>

      Also returning to that idea of H standing for Ш - more common form

      Greatsy is looking for new ways. Some of those ways are ways off.<br>

      futur is further.<br>
      <br>
      upd: why is not only for the future, but for the context, for the
      road goas both ways, and if you ask in the past "why did that
      happen" you ask about the course of events, and they answer with
      because, which is the same as by course. by is be? War&amp;Peace
      by Tolstoy = War&amp;Peace is Tolstoy. bi is banks? I was thinking
      of bystanders so now let's think of bistandards, double standards.
      standarts in russian they use t there. art stands as standart.

      Thus will is forward, was is before, would is wood? like if those
      three or more directions relate to elements of the world, they
      should correspond. wood is a combination of earth &amp; water, as
      would is combination of future &amp; past. which is future &amp;
      which is past? future flows, changes, undefined, past is solid and
      unchanged as much, uneluding, not dissolved in the sand, which
      acts as earth in some extent. probably people of the past saw sand
      as earth without water.. they didn't use withouts. they declared
      it as earth+fire? let's see it in chinese books:<br>

      Nope, they're using way more abstract meanings. And speaking of
      gods as abstractions in the comprehension of the masses, we may
      ponder on that later, but looking for the sand in trigrams,
      futile: <br>

      I dare to doubt that summer &amp; winter are not the opposites,
      Summer &amp; Autumn shouldn't be opposite this way as just bothe
      monograms switched. I would accept Spring &amp; Autumn as
      opposites, but not summer &amp; Autumn/ something is wrong here,
      let's see if it's structural flaw or if that immage is mistaken:<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one image told about relation of trigrams
      to hours of the day, and another one could only tell me what I
      already knew, but in another perspective, which brought it here.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So for they don't really
      know what which digram stands for, let's look into that other
      weird school we stumbled upon in volume I:<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      dry dead<br>
      some branches are dry/ m to g just came, based on the weirdest b ~
      g, which is gimel=lamed, thus double c is B so is it just vertical
      wave, and b is it's staffed form?<br>
      <br>
      M ? M is B&nbsp; as Л is Г. arewn't they those wife &amp; man? <font
        color="#cccccc">I can see it requires explanation, maybe later.</font><br>
      then double Л is М and double C is B and Aᛒᚦ is ABC and D as an
      invariant of C, it's staved form.<br>
      That is why g is G in endlish, but D in russian. G is a voiced
      form of C. See, roman alphabet is latin as later for it explanes
      its form way less than runes. And did I say that clueless child
      will find runes more archaic than even archaic latin. <font
        color="#cccccc">I use archaic instead of old which is entangling
        text for non-specialists, which is a standart academic symptome
        originating in a bigger influx of second-language writers.</font><br>
      <br>
      double Л is М as double C is B <br>
      <br>
      ᚦ is a male strike with an axe. and in huntrit (let's call
      hunters' taal this way) it's man leaves such marks<br>
      ᛒ is some more information, in one blow weak man (arms as wigs)
      cannot do. Wig man is wicked witch<br>
      <br>
      so have we found the woo root in woman, wife, femakle?<br>
      <br>
      imagine how rude other words for stereotyped categories can be.
      Nigger is tabooed as we speak, but it only means black in german..
      isn't it schwarze? swarzenegger is black пахарь.. black plowman,
      ploughman, plougher. <span title="" class="">

            title="" class="">Pflüger. what is negger really? I was
            brought about with that concept that schwarzenegger is
            чёрный пахарь. что было бы странно, учитывая что африканцы
            не слишком-то пашут, у них и так всё растёт. и египет
            переводят как чернозём ложно. это на арабском может египет =
            африка = чёрная земля (земля чёрных) - но возвращаясь к
            шварцу (который негрь (уголь? несгоревший или негорел..
            негрила.. не горилла? )) we humans will probably have to
            leave these old words away. and leaving in capsules we'll
            have some other features (may them be good) and gender and
            ethnicity will be the least of them/ Niger is a name of an
            african country, so my rude etymologis can be more offensive
            than the actual ones, but that's how it is heard and
            subconciously understood, so I don't know if Niger is a word
            of some african language, but it could be caught out of
            their language pool for being recognized in some european
            language wrongly but with a fun banter. <br>

      Which is an independent discovery of the same structure. And if
      before I made my best to avoid reading other books on the subject,
      to keep my research as independent <font color="#cccccc">(and
        from the mistakes of the other authors)</font> as possible.
      Recently I have felt myself way more confident and began
      spray-buying books on history of writing systems. And nobody
      seemed to see the obvious symmetries of vowels. The best I could
      buy is a collection of writing systems of the world without much
      of describing, but who really needs it on paper when it's
      hypertexted in the internet. <font color="#999999">Where you can
        also find some freaky fellows pulling texts in one language to
        another (though if we<font color="#cccccc">, russians,</font>
        read texts of older than five centuries we have problems
        understanding it)</font> so my task is to collect all the primal
      words, to compare the most simple of them, to understand the
      phonetic liberties those words allow and if something other than
      white noise emerges out of that venture, we reconstruct the
      following language from that scratch. <br>
      And the fact that this guy makes his research from scratch is an
      evidence of this field being just new born. Or I would never heard
      about him if there was no internet, so who knows how many
      independent researches like him managed to see AEIOU
      structure.&nbsp; It's so much in your face sometimes, but people
      just can't see it, it stunned me when I first witnessed it - as
      they say, there are those who see, those who see when you show
      them and those who don't see. And it's tremendous how many of
      people don't see. Those proverbal 95%.<img
src="file:///home/mahead/aeiou-git/aeioubt.github.io/III_files/Scientists-and-Belief-1.gif"
        alt="" height="223" align="right" width="474"> And thus only few
      of us can see. So all the science is probably carried by those 5%
      of people who can see when they're shown. But of course even in
      scientific community they're in minority. Or am I just getting too
      counterproductively bitter? For I know that some smart people
      believe in god for whatever reasons, just as many not so bright
      people believe in god for some wrong reasons. The same people who
      believe in god living in russia <br>
      used to be atheists while they were living in ussr<br>
      <br>
      Wim J Borsboom uses the following image:<br>
      <img src="III_files/tumblr_myyn6cRDiz1rgfuxjo2_r2_1280.jpg" alt=""

      Which I missed not recognizing abecedary in it, leaving it for
      later when I speak greek.<br>
      But it is an abecedary, a plane from a set of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayum_alphabet">four</a>. <br>
      <br>
      But while I was looking for other three, I found an opinion that
      it is a forgery:<br>
      <a href="http://preearth.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=1181">http://preearth.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=1181</a>

      whether you accept or deny their arguments, it's quite a vault of
      information on the subject and a rabbit hole I maybe will descend
      further. But because forgeries are possible, I wanted to focus on
      modern forms of writing systems (for these symmetries were found
      in them, so I can research it further using only modern material.
      But public wanted me to look into what historical linguistics
      tells on the subject, even though it doesn't actually speak much
      (and half of that is false, alas))<br>
      <br>
      Wim J Borsboom brings the term Varga to the table, and gives an
      interesting guess that difference in eastern &amp; western order
      of writing systems could be caused by those vargas (labial, velar,
      coronal) misarranged by a traveller who brought them to the west
      on separate tablets. <font color="#cccccc">(he also was confused
        by some common misconceptions of consonant alphabets &amp;
        medieval origin of minuscule, which I debunked earlier, so I'll
        give him a link to this part, so he can patch his approach)</font>
      which is another explanation of that switch, that it was not by
      some religious reasons, but by mere accident <font
        color="#999999">(which I doubt, because of the reasons I gave
        before <font color="#cccccc">(greek Z for Zeus replacing Θ for

      He derives alphabet from India, which is understandable, for
      hindus do recognize vargas <font color="#cccccc">(I'm not sure
        it's the correct form, I only found it in <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varga_%28astrology%29"><font
            color="#cccccc">a</font></a>strology, but he studies
        sanskrit, so he probably knows it better)</font> while in
      western tradition this knowledge seem to be completely lost and

      I can only guess how the other three lines are related to it.
      Probably some scholar just compared them.<br>
      Where I took it (images are clickable) it said: <br>

      I brought this bottle here only to satisfy my urge to collect all
      the abecedaries in one place (though I hope somebody does it
      better and before me) and mostly because it represents inverted B,
      which caught my attention in roman cursive <a href="img/247.png">b</a>
      and egyptian<font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 48px; color:

      I think some good ai should look into what that guy could find for
      of course I am biased to see clearly what he reconstructs (I read
      it researching so my head got tired when I got half through it,
      and then I read some more, though I told you not to. And I also
      typed all these (from "Today academia.edu") <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">I also shall return to that reading mostly
        to understand what prevented me from comprehending his
        argumentation to maybe understand what prevent most of the
