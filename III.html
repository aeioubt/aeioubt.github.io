          them somewhat less. Though soil, not air is the more common
          among elemental systems, what if it's the both. Air is the
          product of the earth, without the soil there would be no air.
          And ש is the chaotic energy which is some other force, and it
          makes us guests from space? Otherwise we would be the Earth

          And I go on with my research: <br>
          Х ~ Ж if we recognize X as stavless Ж, ᚷ as stavless ᚼ<br>
          Also because J can be read as Ж [j] in french, but as ᚷ [h] in
          spanish<br>
          And position of russian Ж correlate greek H (and Z is after
          it, not in front as in greek. So does it make greek later
          relating to russian? In russian second row Z stands in the
          end, not in the front, but do russians have F after E? No, but
          Ё. (I spoke about it whether in this version or look for older
          ones in web archive)<br>
          <br>
          ᚷ as stavless ᚼ exp;ains hot ~ жара and makes me believe
          that's the same t as in to, which comes ть in russian &amp; る
          in japanese. (I)t seems to come ra in russian, while in verbs

          I think I found my H, as bekar after b, notice how ♮ resembles

          Surprise is that in my own city lives another kid who've found
          something incredible in russian alphabet:<br>
          <a href="https://roouh.livejournal.com/133411.html"><img

          <br>
          We see K breaking sequence once again (does it mean it wasn't
          tabooed, it wasn't invented in those ancient abecedarias of
          some archaic latin <font color="#999999">(I'm not sure that
            period is named archaic, you look it up yourself if you care
            of the exact taxonomy)</font><br>
          Also П can be an invariant of R which would go farting (the
          sound only some most ancient native americans lost in the
          jungle speak this sound. That 3-vowel tribe, I wrote about
          them, I don't remember the name.<br>
          This sequence of voiced-sonors-voiceless. Is not present in
          english, but we know that G is invariant of C and that C used
          to sound like G, at least I read it. <br>
          It is arranged as if students begin loud and clear in voiced
          forms of the letters, but getting tired their voices became
          less clear until it switched off completely and only wisper
          would come out. O &amp; especially У are way more tired than A
          &amp; E, vowels could also influence the enthusiasm of
          pronunciation. So it could be either appear this way
          naturally, or be arranged this way to ease the reading of the
          alphabet. <br>
          Let's see if such a sequence is present in any of other

            with roouh that what we have here is three groups, for ЙЛМНР
            are all named sonors: [jlmnr] but I'd rather believe that
            they're untuned by insertion of K and originally there was
            no K &amp; they all were voiced. Then R is also out of
            sequence, and as K &amp; R are graphically similar, it seems
            we found another key to this clockwork, for I always
            wondered how could it be that P is R in russian? Bornholm
            runic alphabet also doesn't have P, so I think R used to be
            lingual "fart". <br>

          R is also secondary, because there are more important letters<br>

          is somewhere near greek: <br>
          the only difference is that postionian greek doesn't see H as
          [h]<br>
          and that hebrew includes some additional letters (surprise!)
          but <br>
          they are voiceless, so who knows maybe it tells that they
          follow <br>
          this voiced-voicelss tendency more.<br>
          <br>
          So is it just a coincidence, which became quasi-structure in
          one<br>
          of them, or is it common among all of them one way or another.<br>
          I would look for some structural tendency if latin shows no<br>
          tendency of having more voiced in the first half.<br>
          <br>
          But P instead of B, T instead of D, I think this
          voiced-voiceless is set from the initial ABD/VFH <br>
          but let's conduct the experiment:<br>
          <br>
          A <font color="#ff0000">B</font> <font color="#33cc00">C</font>
          <font color="#ff0000">D</font> E <font color="#33cc00">F</font>

          <br>
          Еven in latin second half has more voiceless letters, but it's
          on the brink of losing this tendency completely:<br>
          First half contains 4 voiceless: CFHK<br>
          Second half contains 5 voiceless: PQSTX <font color="#cccccc">(even






































            though the second half as we broke it is 2 letters shorter)</font><br>
          And if we cound voiced, then <br>
          First half contains 7 voiced: BDGJLMN<br>
          Second half contains 5 voiced: RVWYZ (and if we count VW as 1
          &amp; Y as vowel, even less: 3)<br>
          But if we remember that LMN are the beginning of the second
          half of the alphabet (as official etymology of "element"
          tells) then it's only 4 voiced in the first half, and even if
          we exclude W &amp; Y it's 6 against 4, which breaks the
          tendency. <br>

          well, in this case first half has 5 voiced, and the second -
          only 4 (but if we turn W back on?)<br>
          <br>
          It could also happen this way in latin because of some reform
          of sharing the voiced through the structure, not to make the
          pyramid way to obvious that bottom doesn't have a say.<br>
          <br>
          Anyway, latin is an exception among those I've seen above,
          let's look into georgian alphabet, to see if it's just some
          hellenic fluctuation or some truer symmetry, which could be
          cause by BD PT of some ancient unknown alphabet, mama first
          papa second, baba dada also go this way, and if some southern
          nations call papa baba, this deserves its own research.<br>
          <br>
          The reason I throw away R &amp; not P is because the grapheme
          P is known in both latin &amp; russian <font color="#666666">&amp;






































            greek,</font> while R is only in latin. Also cursive k is
          even more similar to R than K and we need P as labial in our
          common structure of ABCD (notice that ABC also has voiced
          before voiceless) <br>
          then russians have П but no Р (could russian Р be invariant of
          П as if it's voiced form, even though it wasn't voice but
          bright vibration of lips. So could be R voiceless too (then we
          don't have to exclude it here) for it's brightness is not
          necessary on vocal cords, for it comes from tongue &amp;
          alveols?<br>

          Surprisingly, in georgian voiced-voiceless tendency is less
          preserved than even in greek &amp; hebrew <br>
          <font color="#cccccc">(or is it, on contrary, promoted) </font>for






































          not only R but several other voiced letters appear in the
          second half.<br>
          Still it's more obvious than in latin, especially if we split
          it as it is, however we break it the most of voiceless are in
          the second half. But if M is the central letter, both halves
          have the same ammount of voiced.<br>
          <br>
          In conclusion to this paragraph I have to say that this
          tendency is definitely present, but if it's artificially
          conceived or has it occured naturally this is almost
          impossible to say, probably reformers of russian alphabet
          noticed this tendency and fostered it a little.<br>
          <br>
          This tendency also supports the idea of russian В being placed
          in the place of F, for it could be voiced before, they say it
          used to be W - semitic vav is voiced. And В looks like θ which
          used to belong somethere.<br>
          <br>
          Let's look at all of the sudden spectacular russian if we
          consider Р [r] voiceless (whisper of r is r)<br>

          just as I couldn't figure out the ancient linguistic
          understanding of linguals (made by tongue) wandering among
          alveolar, dental, so was that guy mislead by knowing too much.
          Sonors, huh.<br>
          Though If I understand Р <font color="#cccccc">(Russian R
            looks like P)</font> as voiceless because it's whispering
          has no pair, and thus voiceless M is also M. while voiceless
          BDGJVZ are PTKCFS <font color="#cccccc">(C here is Ch, for
            only K is always K)</font> <br>

          voiceless? let's look at those sonors:<br>

          <br>
          and I was thinking the other day: " what if Ф is initial form
          of P, because there's no Ф in latin, but that's not what my
          thought began with. I began with looking at runic labials: ᛒᚠᛉ
          and even ᚢ all are dual. except P, which is neither in the
          bornolm runic alphabet (named by von List as armanen runes) <br>
          So what if these two rows are voiced &amp; voiceless and as
          genomic apparatus checks for mutations comparing two strings,
          we can reconstruct earlier phonetics of those alphabetic
          signs.<br>

          <br>
          There's now now labial after У, but only because there's no
          labial after EЁ <br>
          but it's F after E, and it's Ф after У<br>
          but Ф is already used. but what's use of the two voiced after
          O? Ф may be used instead of P, then why П?<br>
          let's look at latin once again:<br>

          most of the voiced mess is in the final line (we russians have

          so let's look at it in the ancient form:<br>

          could it be related to 6 being so popular among heathens? Are

          then B is doubel b <font color="#cccccc">(B is v in russian,

          so now there's 8 of them. could it be where the word octave
          comes from?<br>
          <br>
          now these two lines are in abcd mode. let's look if they can
          be in axial:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <font color="#ff0000"><br>
            &nbsp; B&nbsp;</font> <font color="#ff0000">G</font> <br>
          <font color="#ff0000">D</font>&nbsp; O&nbsp; <font
            color="#33cc00"><font color="#33cc00">Ф</font> <br>
            &nbsp; Q</font><font color="#33cc00">&nbsp; T</font><br>
          <br>
          actually yes. and V is envoked by it.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <font color="#ff0000"><br>
            &nbsp; B&nbsp;</font> <font color="#ff0000">G</font> <br>
          <font color="#ff0000">D</font>&nbsp; O&nbsp; <font
            color="#33cc00"><font color="#33cc00">P</font> <br>
            &nbsp; Q</font><font color="#33cc00">&nbsp; T</font><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Shouldn't I make up my mind if V is labial consonant or vowel?
          But it is both, in different cultures it's both, and sometimes
          it's in the same culture both (as vav in semitic languages,
          even though both lineal &amp; axial symmetries recognize vav
          as labial consonant, and maybe that's why both و &amp; ו stand
          for "&amp;" and both are consonant labials: و is wъ, ו is v,
          and we can see that more modern arabic has drifted more
          towards vowel u, and today ו can be used also for u &amp; o,
          but to make it o (literally "or") we have to put aleph before
          it: או, which reminds me of יהוה being transliterated as Io,
          which reminds both greek deity (and I'm not exactly sure it's
          the same Io whose priestess invented alphabet, but wth, of
          course it's her) and polynesian highest deity of a cult very
          similar to judaism, I think I've already wrote about it, and I
          think I wrote that ה makes ' &amp; ו vowels, but isn't י vowel
          by default? Those who know hebrew probably laugh at me right
          now.<br>
          <br>
          that abgd-opqt pair keeps v vowel, and yet I'm not sure this
          reconstruction reconstructs any representation actually
          existing in the past, roouh begins with one ancient russian
          abecedary, and look at it, it breaks the alphabet in half
          exactly between voiced &amp; voiceless (wonderful thing is
          that k is missing, and it doesn't seem to have enough space
          for k:<br>

          voiced-voiceless order is the original one (it's more present
          in hebrew, than it is in latin, and it is somewhat general
          that voiced tend to gather in the beginning of the alphabet (B
          is voiced, K is not, so now let's look how it is in eastern
          ones:<br>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hentaigana"><img
              src="III_files/Hentaigana.png" alt="" height="607"
              border="0" width="1009"></a><br>
          <br>
          they all are voiceless by default and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakuten_and_handakuten">゛</a>
          makes it voiced (only the sonor ones are voiced already: m, n,
          l/r<br>
          wait a minute, there are more of those: it goes a ka sa ta na
          ha ma ya ra wa n<br>
          <br>

            width="502"><br>
          <br>
          so it's definitely voiceless (those to which ゛ can be applied)
          in the front, sonors (voiced by default) in the back. it
          breaks between ta &amp; na &amp; only ha goes exceptional, and
          it is exceptional, because it can be applied with&nbsp; ﾟ to
          make p- but it's b when ゛ is on it's right upper corner, but
          it's more funny than this, because that ha is more weird than
          that: it's wa most of the time: boku wa baka gaijin desu,
          sumimasen, this wa is actually that very ha, so if it's wrong
          that it's ha or not, it's exceptional, and other than that
          mayarawan are all sonors, and kasata are once again remind
          second half of the first raw: as if ha was replaced from it's
          honorable position. ahakasata - is it how it was? because I
          was already seeing things like aka satana (akai is red in
          japanese, and -i suffix is the same as russians use for
          adjectives, and russians sometimes just don't use that suffix
          to create so called "short adjectives" which may tell that
          adjectives are as ancient as nouns and verbs. red can be even
          more primal than raid. <br>
          <br>
          But back on track, what I wanted to say is<br>
          <font size="+2"><font size="+2">א<font color="#ff0000"> ב ג ד

          as four representations of the same two letters, as
          sillabaries do, but this time with only 4 vowels &amp; 2
          consonants, even before 5 vowels, B and T<br>
          You can notice that this way they're grouped according to IPA
          into plosive, fricative, nasal, whisper. <font
            color="#cccccc">IPA puts B&amp;D in the same group, and
            D&amp;T too, so I named those voiceless whispers by miself.
          </font>Which may witness something about the jewish vowels
          themselves. Is O a wisper form of A? Because <font size="+2"><font
              size="+2">ע</font></font> is related to O. It could be
          more related to У, but it stands at O position. Though if we
          compare the final line of jewish alphabet with У line, we get
          У as <font size="+2"><font size="+2">ע</font></font> and Ф as
          <font size="+2"><font size="+2">פ</font></font> which is
          direct transliteration and Х as <font size="+2"><font
              size="+2">צ</font></font> which is weird, though cursive <font
            size="+2"><font size="+2">צ</font></font> looks like З
          (there's no unicode for cursive, so watch it up in that .odo
          addon) and initial X does sound like Z. Ц as <font size="+2"><font
              size="+2">ק</font></font> which is equally weird, though C
          could stand for both, Ч for <font size="+2"><font size="+2">ר</font></font>
          which is quite a coincidence, because cursive ч looks exactly
          like cursive r - is it why they call it cursive? as of curse,
          the script which made them misunderstand one another, tour as

          because we don't have these two in russian (is it an argument
          enough? but what if russians had alphabetic canon before
          christians, and though I only shyly attempted to notice this
          possibility (because they were caught redhanded in this sort
          of crime of claiming authority over something they didn't
          author)<br>
          after that it was clear that&nbsp; has to go (because bornholm
          alphabet's first row only has ᛒᚦ instead of BCD, because of b
          d symmetry shining on so many levels: BD, БД, ⰂⰄ, 𓃀𓂧 and
          even <font size="+2"><font size="+2">בד</font></font> are
          probably here, but сСГⰃ(𓈎𓎡𓎼)ג never plays this game, which
          makes me think it should go from the protoalphabet (it also
          didn't exist in that mythic 5 vowels, B &amp; T, and also only
          latin alphabet has velar column distinctly, unlike the others)<br>
          I knew M had to go first, an we still have N following, which
          marks L as invariant of I further in history than N as
          invariant of I (И) if it even is, for if it is, M must be an
          invariant of И too, which would be super weird, because I is
          lingual, and M is labial. but AIU correlate AMT if you even
          know what I mean, I think it's one of those moments when I'm
          so high in that depth, that even me won't be able to make
          sense of this.<br>
          So here I already had a distinct pattern, so to determine
          which of many voiceless sounds of the fourth and final row go
          into my reconstruction of protoalphabet wasn't difficult at
          all. P &amp; T of course. which is kinda sad, because I

      Roman secunda is 24 times longer than ours<br>
      Does it mean one hour in their system was a term for a day? <br>
      Година is hour in ukrainian, but year in russian: год is year to
      be precise, so russians would understand година as год.<br>
      Is it why "сейчас" (now) is more likely to mean "сегодня, сего
      дня" (today) than "сей час" (this hour, tohour) - well, no, сейчас
      сегодня собраны по одному принципу. сей и сего - просто в разных
      падежах. Но разве разница в падежах не являет иную грамматическую
      форму? если бы их собирали одновременно, то сейчас, сейдень.
      "Сегодня" более изысканно флектуатическая структура, а значит она
      с некоторой вероятностью была собрана позже, потому что "сейчас"
      это китайцы так слова собирают, а они законсервировали грамматику
      на самом раннем этапе из всех что я знаю. И я считаю что это
      свидетельствует о древности их письменности и языка. Could

        me, fuck ''''s, co is not russian ко, к, semantically they are
        different. but "на хуй" (на ~ к) has semantic values of go, So I

      у- stands for something like away (and for way in "way (too big)")

      russian is вон, прочь, от as direct cognate of out, which corelate
      it with off and of.<br>
      Which made me think of u- (especially initial one, or even any
      initial vowel) to inverse what follows: out = of, idi = go (idi is
      go in russsin: иди) and there probably were some other examples. I

                  brave approach I offered here, comparing all the
                  languages globally, ignoring all the human-made
                  definitions, reconstructions &amp; divisions into
                  families or whatever. And then maybe even other
                  animals' languages will be compared with ours.</span></span></span></span></span></span>

      This alphabet which is persian, not arabic (arabic lack few of

      <br>
      is also alphabetic if you watch at the first letters in the
      groups:<br>

        color="#ff0000">ی</font><br>
      <br>
      all I was going to say is <font color="#ff0000">ه</font> و look
      like E F when they're written in a different font: <font
        color="#ff0000">ه</font>و<br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">(you should try to type mixing hebrew or
        arabic with latin or russian, it's a mindf</font><br>
      <br>
      Notice that having removed the doublets, we got ourselves 18
      letters, which is a magic number of 3 sects<br>
      (sects are aettir but of 6s)<br>
      sso is 6s &amp; 8s the same old war for geometric forms (arabs
      adore 8-poiinted star (it's united) while jews prefer 6-pointed
      star (it's separated) <br>
      6-pointed star is probably historically more ancient (it's both
      less points, 18-letter alphabets are older than 24-letter ones,
      judaism is older than islam) but 8-pointed is also a cross. and
      sun shines mostly across (but it's because of the effect our
      eyelashes create (because sun rotates together with our head, and
      the cross is seen when eyes are half-closed, otherwise sun goes
      all the way)<br>
      <br>
      The idea of separation of the alphabet into voiced &amp; voiceless
      can be used as an instrument to deliver the previous form of the
      alphabet:<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#ff0000">ا</font> <font color="#3366ff">ب</font> ج د
      ر س ص ط <font color="#ff0000">ع</font><font color="#3366ff"> ف</font>
      ق ک ل <font color="#3366ff"> م</font> <font color="#000099">ن</font>
      <font color="#ff0000">ه</font> <font color="#33ffff">و</font> <font
        color="#ff0000">ی</font><br>
      <br>
      First I noticed that this way we have vowels in the end (as
      russians coplete it, as greeks had omega, as runic alphabet had ᚢ
      (v, u (oo)) and roman alphabet had V, v (v, u) and russian
      alphabet had Ѵ, ѵ as finals)<br>
      And just before those vowels ن [n] stands and in greek minuscule
      [n] is <span title="Greek language text" lang="el">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        <span title="Greek language text" lang="el">ν</span></span><br>
      and after jewish <font size="+2"><font size="+2">נ</font></font>
      [n] stands <font size="+2">ס</font> which looks just like ه -
      could there be some cultureal correlation (and the script is of
      the same size, but hebrew is extra large in the text, otherwise it
      was really small, and arabic is in normal size (as is all this
      text) let's make it extra extra large and compare them:<br>
      <font color="#ff0000" size="+3">ا</font><font size="+3"> <font
          color="#3366ff">ب</font> ج د ر س ص ط <font color="#ff0000">ع</font><font

      <font size="+3">ا</font><font size="+3"> ب ج د ر س ص ط ع ف ق ک ل م
        ن ه و ی</font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size="+3">ه</font> stands where <font size="+2">ס</font>
      does. and they look the same, and I hate to diss your concealium,
      consealium, what is the word.. concilium, but I must notice that
      after n o fololows, and it looks exactly like <font size="+3">ه</font>
      and <font size="+2">ס</font> especially if you know they're
      backwards. So who's reading those texts wrong all the time?<br>
      <font size="+3">ه</font> is definitely closer to o than <font
        size="+2">ס</font>, especially if you transliterate it into
      jewish <font size="+2"><font size="+2">ה</font></font> which
      stands where e does, not o. but in arabic even though <font
        size="+3">ه</font> is closer to vowers than <font size="+2">ס</font>
      is, which also reminds greek σ - which resembles o just
      strikingly! and σ has it's own story of how Σ looks like E and
      that school=ecole, student=etudiant, and some more examples of the
      kind there is. scream just gets rid of s or e, and it's <span
        class="gt-baf-cell gt-baf-word-clickable">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;

            and even though it's not greek, but french, just as sign
            languages don't correlate speaking languages, so writing
            systems can be not corresponding with the languages they're
            used for, hence this babelonian mess I'm disentangling here.<br>
          </span></span></span><br>
      and ◯ could be a holy symbol, named by different nations
      differently, and thus... just a speculation<br>
      but if <font size="+3"> ه</font> is sun, <font size="+3">و</font>
      can be the moon<br>
      and they stand together in the second row, where E &amp; F do, and
      F is moon, because it's not always full.<br>
      and F is connected with fornication, and moon is the night, which
      is more proper for sex, and it's literally 6<br>
      and 6 looks like <font size="+3">و</font>, though 9 would fit
      more. And if we count it backwards from <font size="+3">و</font>,
      we may find that if <font size="+3">و</font> is 9, then 1 is <font
        size="+3">ع</font> which opens the second half of the alphabet,
      only it not begins, but ends with LMN. And it's 10 of them in that
      second half, and the first half is of 8, and if we abruptly
      exclude 9 &amp; 10 from the second half, we'll get alphabet of 16,
      as that "younger futhark" - I believe it's literally younger than
      it's older form, like when the system wasn't developed enough,
      when it was young. see the mindf/?&nbsp; <br>
      and the final letter looks like 。 which is as ◯ named maru. and 。
      is japanese . and dot is how one of ugaritic alphabets end (I
      never saw the artefact they took it from, but it's there, in their
      literature, I guess. <br>
      <img src="III_files/ugaritic.png" alt="" height="600" width="1163"><br>
      So if <font size="+3"> ه</font> is a dot, <font size="+3">و</font>&nbsp;

























      can be a comma. And whatever <font size="+3">ی</font> is, it can
      be wind if <font size="+3"> ه</font> and <font size="+3">و</font>&nbsp;

























      are sun &amp; moon. <br>
      (in one russian fairytail a prince asked from sun, from moon &amp;
      from the wind. Are that another representation of trinity? saint
      spirit is similar to wind. but son as sun seems to be related as
      heresy by older religions, father is the king, that's the old
      order, son only transmits its will (even when king is dead, he was
      deity ever-living), then son is not sun, but moon, man he is.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">But back on track, why don't I go further
        and don't compare <font size="+3">ع</font> to three? why stop
        where it's convenient? have I ever stopped? then I'd call <font
          size="+3">ا</font> the 1, then I'd see nothing better than to
        name <font size="+3">ج</font> the 2? then <font size="+3">ط</font>
        the four? nah... though I think I saw something of the kind
        somewhere (here I wanted to dig deeper, but no, this path, if it
        even exists is still too early for me, I've already bought books
        on history of numbers, so I must read them, but I have so many
        thing to do, so I must go on train to make myself read.) </font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="+3">و</font>&nbsp; can be a comma especially because
      it stands for "and" <br>
      <br>
      LMN ending the alphabet makes another sense because it ends it
      with aMeN<br>
      and alumin is a joking mocking of аминь, but that as I heard it,
      aluminum was considered the most precious until we figured out how
      to extract it. alumni is also a word meaning of which I still
      don't know... <br>

      But let me finish this topic before I go away:<br>
      <font size="+3">ا</font><font size="+3"> <font color="#ff0000">ب
          ج د ر</font> <font color="#33cc00">س ص ط</font> ع <font

        ه <font color="#ff0000">و</font> ی</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
        color="#cccccc">(red are voiced, green are voiceless)</font><br>
      First i wanted to guess that <font color="#33cc00" size="+3">س ص
        ط</font> are some ignorant extras, so applying that
      voiced-voiceless thing we can replace them and<font size="+3"> <font
          color="#ff0000">ل م ن</font> ه <font color="#ff0000">و</font>
        ی</font>&nbsp; too, but now I see: what if their structure was
      to keep silents inside and voiced outside? Doesn't it make sense?
      It does. So hail diversity, or something, let all the flowers
      bloom, some of them may happen to be of youth and you don't know
      which (use, not youth, but I cherish typos, and this one can be
      exactly right: some flowers can be of youth, and we don't know
      which. and even when we gain the eternal youth, those flowers
      still can be of use to us in the eternal future it's for sure) <br>
      <br>
      Why did I remove all those dotted invariants? Because inclusion of
      those ones disrupts the structures in european alphabet, ancient
      texts are reported to include no dots. at least in hebrew, I'm not
      sure of runes.<br>
      <br>
      I think I already mentioned it somewhere before, but this sequence
      also has la<font color="#33ccff">b</font>ials after v<font
        color="#ff0000">o</font>wels:<br>
      &nbsp;<font color="#ff0000" size="+3">ا</font><font size="+3"> <font

        <font color="#33ccff">و</font> <font color="#ff0000">ی</font></font><br>
      and again <font size="+3">م</font> is the exception, yet even <font
        size="+3">و</font> is preceded by <font size="+3">ه</font>,
      which makes me think that <font size="+3">ی</font> could be
      lingual y before. As if this sequence was before. hm.. anyway if <font
        size="+3">ی</font> is vowel in that end, it puts him along with
      greek. Though that shout.. shourt.. short like ..line is weird,
      the same is in gu.. ugaritic. I'm also hungry now, goeedbye...
      notice how that very i-line is collected in the end, as if it's
      the newest, the most disrupted too.<br>
      <br>
      Notice, that <font size="+3">ه</font> isn't actually vowel in
      modern arabic, and <font size="+3">ی</font> can be shortened to
      й, the [j] and only <font size="+3">ا</font><font size="+3"> </font>and<font
        size="+3"> ع</font> are always vowels. <font size="+3">و</font>&nbsp;

























      too can be vowel, but just as <font size="+3">ی</font>, not
      always, so these final two also make a pair, a pair of
      semi-vowels. and <font size="+3">ه</font> is probably one of
      them, though it's never vowel in arabic, it's always vowel in
      hebrew, and always vowel in greek, latin, and all the others
      actually.<br>
      <br>
      I didn't find much when I looked for <font size="+3">ع</font>
      being the same sign as 3, but it's also the same sign as E. And
      both are followed with fey, and b is for бог/ so are these just
      male &amp; female pairs (which makes sense: women historically
      (and actually physiologically) had less voice (half of that of a
      man in shariah court) and yet vowels were named female letters,
      and females managed to have more vowels, and more letters than man
      (as they have bigger attention to nuances, just as they have names
      for more colours than guys usually do) and more labials are on
      their side (the ratio is the same as with vowels. And isn't it the
      answer to why there are three mothers, but four or five labials? B
      is Babushka, the Granny (B &amp; G the same again. Бог Господь)<br>
      Granny can be kinder than mother, because she's way less disturbed
      with freudian bs, and mothers often have no idea how to treat
      their children, once again, it's just a speculation, something can
      happen out of it, I have long went into draft mode, if you want
      something more certain you should probably stick to the first
      volume, and even there be cautious of my usual liberties. Feя,
      Mother, Vulva? I'm only guessing, looking for the most female
      words. Female, Fe in that word plays the same role as Wo in Women.
      Here Wo sounds as We probably because We is actually a plural form
      of Wo () which tells a story of that word being of female origin.

        Интересной особенностью чукотского языка является то, что
        женщины и мужчины говорят по-разному. Для женщин существует табу
        на произнесение имён родственников мужа и похоже звучащих
        слов[5]. Разница существует также и в произношении обычных слов.
        Там, где мужчины произносят звук «р» или сочетание «рк», женщины
        произносят звук «ц» или «цц». Например, «морж» в мужском
        произношении звучит как «рыркы», а в женском — как «цыццы»[6].
        Другие примеры: мужчинами произносится ч, женщинами — ц:
        чайвыгыргын (муж.), цайвыгыццын (жен.) (в предложении
        Чайвыгыргын мыгитэгъэн! / Цайвыгыццын мыгитэгъэн!) или
        чайвыгыргын рэгитэӈэ (муж.) — цайвыгыццын цэгитэӈэ (жен.); «с»
        также может заменяться на «ц»: мылгынутэсӄык панрэвкы (муж.) —
        мылгынутэцӄык панцэвкы (жен.) (в предложении Тыӄэӈавытыйӈын
        мылгынутэсӄык панрэвкы вальык нымӈиӄин / Тыӄэӈавытыйӈын

      но где-то эта третья форма использовалась для второго лица? ты!
      да, это не вежливо, но до сих пор иногда применяется, когда тыкают
      в человека пальцем и спрашивают у него "он что думал?"<br>
      H is in переменном ряду (в разных алфавитах он по разному себя
      ведёт, иногда этой буквы нет)<br>
      Зная форму рунической ᚷ которая может быть staveless ᚼ&nbsp;
      предполагаю что h в русском стала ж, как дж в английском где в
      испанском что-то типа х. Но скорей всего наоборот, в русском она
      сохранена чётче (h стоит в столбце переднеязычных (coronal) что
      говорит что она скорее ʃ чем h.<br>
      Что делает he &amp; she инвариантами, и помимо Бьорк поющей шуман
      вместо хуман, вчера слышал песню, где парень пел she там где по
      сюжету было he. что же это была за песня? а, да, самое начало
      альбома Genius/GZA "Liquid Swords" - когда маленький (и возможно
      беззубый) пацан рассказывает про своего отца, говорит he так
      словно это she. She - шепелявая (беззубая) форма he.<br>
      Но тогда he первична, что противоречит тому что я только что
      городил: dh<br>
      <br>
      ا ب پ ت ث ج چ ح خ د ذ ر ز ژ س ش ص ض ط ظ ع غ ف ق ک گ ل م ن ه و ی<br>
      <br>
      ه often looks like e, and in alphabetic symmetry ه<br>
      stands where e does. <br>
      Thus a bigger idea: what if we recognize all alphabet as
      representations of the same system, and compare letters to
      recognize their true semantic value:<br>
      <font color="#ff0000">A</font> may look as an ox (as phoenicians <font
        color="#cccccc">(phoeniciantists)</font> recognize them, but A
      &amp; 𐤀 are the closest forms, when we compare it to hebrew and
      arabic, it's somewhat different: ا of hebrew directly stands for 1
      and if you think what it can be, it's a vertical figure without
      many branches, it's a man.<br>
      but if you compare it to hebrew form, to there are two hebrew
      forms: cursive form is very related to 𐤀<br>
      (I couldn't find hebrew cursive in the unicode. I think I should
      look for it in fonts... use images for now)<br>

      ИКЛМН are all forms of alef? what a surprise! (Н is N in russian
      &amp; N is M in modern hebrew cursive)<br>
      <br>
      once again, I missed a thought:<br>
      ه often looks like e, and in alphabetic symmetry ه<br>
      stands where e does. though eee looks like ههه<br>
      but also M looks like that: م <br>
      Мmm looks like that: ممم<br>
      Which made me think "what if there's some symmetry between م &amp;
      ه ?<br>
      and this path brought me to the following representation:<br>

      ᛐ could be some form of ᛏ when all ᛚ is taken out of it, and <br>

      the celestial bodies, but what's the 7th?) for I noticed triads in
      them in egyptian alphabet: 3 birds, 3 types of animals, 3 body
      parts, 3 parts of a circle (whole, half, quarter. and those other
      forms are in the same relation: a big, a middle, a small) anyway
      what is the fifth triad in egyptial alphabet?<br>

      Russian and English have very similar alphabets, Greek &amp; Latin
      are very alike.<br>
      So how could it happen that they have different understanding of
      the same symbols?<br>
      Why и can be written as u in russian cursive, but и [i]<br>
      Why p is read as coronal R in Russi?<br>
      Why c is sometimes s sometimes k - but this one is another thing,
      I think s is a palatalised k ~ h ~ ш<br>
      as japanese palatalised s is understood as s by some, but as sh by
      others, when it's actually sch, щ<br>
      (that swash at the right bottom corner of that щ is palatalization
      of ш - tatar alphabet has more of them.<br>

        this tatar alphabet to russian, on the base of which it was

      the following one uses another tradition: clumping them all in the

      Thus will is forward, was is before, would is wood? like if those
      three or more directions relate to elements of the world, they
      should correspond. wood is a combination of earth &amp; water, as
      would is combination of future &amp; past. which is future &amp;
      which is past? future flows, changes, undefined, past is solid and
      unchanged as much, uneluding, not dissolved in the sand, which
      acts as earth in some extent. probably people of the past saw sand
      as earth without water.. they didn't use withouts. they declared
      it as earth+fire? let's see it in chinese books:<br>

      Nope, they're using way more abstract meanings. And speaking of
      gods as abstractions in the comprehension of the masses, we may
      ponder on that later, but looking for the sand in trigrams,
      futile: <br>

      I dare to doubt that summer &amp; winter are not the opposites,
      Summer &amp; Autumn shouldn't be opposite this way as just bothe
      monograms switched. I would accept Spring &amp; Autumn as
      opposites, but not summer &amp; Autumn/ something is wrong here,
      let's see if it's structural flaw or if that immage is mistaken:<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one image told about relation of trigrams
      to hours of the day, and another one could only tell me what I
      already knew, but in another perspective, which brought it here.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So for they don't really
      know what which digram stands for, let's look into that other
      weird school we stumbled upon in volume I:<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      dry dead<br>
      some branches are dry/ m to g just came, based on the weirdest b ~
      g, which is gimel=lamed, thus double c is B so is it just vertical
      wave, and b is it's staffed form?<br>
      <br>
      M ? M is B&nbsp; as Л is Г. arewn't they those wife &amp; man? <font
        color="#cccccc">I can see it requires explanation, maybe later.</font><br>
      then double Л is М and double C is B and Aᛒᚦ is ABC and D as an
      invariant of C, it's staved form.<br>
      That is why g is G in endlish, but D in russian. G is a voiced
      form of C. See, roman alphabet is latin as later for it explanes
      its form way less than runes. And did I say that clueless child
      will find runes more archaic than even archaic latin. <font
        color="#cccccc">I use archaic instead of old which is entangling
        text for non-specialists, which is a standart academic symptome
        originating in a bigger influx of second-language writers.</font><br>
      <br>
      double Л is М as double C is B <br>
      <br>
      ᚦ is a male strike with an axe. and in huntrit (let's call
      hunters' taal this way) it's man leaves such marks<br>
      ᛒ is some more information, in one blow weak man (arms as wigs)
      cannot do. Wig man is wicked witch<br>
      <br>
      so have we found the woo root in woman, wife, femakle?<br>
      <br>
      imagine how rude other words for stereotyped categories can be.
      Nigger is tabooed as we speak, but it only means black in german..
      isn't it schwarze? swarzenegger is black пахарь.. black plowman,
      ploughman, plougher. <span title="" class="">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        <span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="de"><span
            title="" class="">Pflüger. what is negger really? I was
            brought about with that concept that schwarzenegger is
            чёрный пахарь. что было бы странно, учитывая что африканцы
            не слишком-то пашут, у них и так всё растёт. и египет
            переводят как чернозём ложно. это на арабском может египет =
            африка = чёрная земля (земля чёрных) - но возвращаясь к
            шварцу (который негрь (уголь? несгоревший или негорел..
            негрила.. не горилла? )) we humans will probably have to
            leave these old words away. and leaving in capsules we'll
            have some other features (may them be good) and gender and
            ethnicity will be the least of them/ Niger is a name of an
            african country, so my rude etymologis can be more offensive
            than the actual ones, but that's how it is heard and
            subconciously understood, so I don't know if Niger is a word
            of some african language, but it could be caught out of
            their language pool for being recognized in some european
            language wrongly but with a fun banter. <br>

      Which is an independent discovery of the same structure. And if
      before I made my best to avoid reading other books on the subject,
      to keep my research as independent <font color="#cccccc">(and
        from the mistakes of the other authors)</font> as possible.
      Recently I have felt myself way more confident and began
      spray-buying books on history of writing systems. And nobody
      seemed to see the obvious symmetries of vowels. The best I could
      buy is a collection of writing systems of the world without much
      of describing, but who really needs it on paper when it's
      hypertexted in the internet. <font color="#999999">Where you can
        also find some freaky fellows pulling texts in one language to
        another (though if we<font color="#cccccc">, russians,</font>
        read texts of older than five centuries we have problems
        understanding it)</font> so my task is to collect all the primal
      words, to compare the most simple of them, to understand the
      phonetic liberties those words allow and if something other than
      white noise emerges out of that venture, we reconstruct the
      following language from that scratch. <br>
      And the fact that this guy makes his research from scratch is an
      evidence of this field being just new born. Or I would never heard
      about him if there was no internet, so who knows how many
      independent researches like him managed to see AEIOU
      structure.&nbsp; It's so much in your face sometimes, but people
      just can't see it, it stunned me when I first witnessed it - as
      they say, there are those who see, those who see when you show
      them and those who don't see. And it's tremendous how many of
      people don't see. Those proverbal 95%.<img

        alt="" height="223" align="right" width="474"> And thus only few
      of us can see. So all the science is probably carried by those 5%
      of people who can see when they're shown. But of course even in
      scientific community they're in minority. Or am I just getting too
      counterproductively bitter? For I know that some smart people
      believe in god for whatever reasons, just as many not so bright
      people believe in god for some wrong reasons. The same people who
      believe in god living in russia <br>
      used to be atheists while they were living in ussr<br>

      Which I missed not recognizing abecedary in it, leaving it for
      later when I speak greek.<br>
      But it is an abecedary, a plane from a set of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayum_alphabet">four</a>. <br>
      <br>
      But while I was looking for other three, I found an opinion that
      it is a forgery:<br>
      <a href="http://preearth.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=1181">http://preearth.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=1181</a>

      whether you accept or deny their arguments, it's quite a vault of
      information on the subject and a rabbit hole I maybe will descend
      further. But because forgeries are possible, I wanted to focus on
      modern forms of writing systems (for these symmetries were found
      in them, so I can research it further using only modern material.
      But public wanted me to look into what historical linguistics
      tells on the subject, even though it doesn't actually speak much
      (and half of that is false, alas))<br>
      <br>
      Wim J Borsboom brings the term Varga to the table, and gives an
      interesting guess that difference in eastern &amp; western order
      of writing systems could be caused by those vargas (labial, velar,
      coronal) misarranged by a traveller who brought them to the west
      on separate tablets. <font color="#cccccc">(he also was confused
        by some common misconceptions of consonant alphabets &amp;
        medieval origin of minuscule, which I debunked earlier, so I'll
        give him a link to this part, so he can patch his approach)</font>
      which is another explanation of that switch, that it was not by
      some religious reasons, but by mere accident <font
        color="#999999">(which I doubt, because of the reasons I gave
        before <font color="#cccccc">(greek Z for Zeus replacing Θ for

          as one of them)</font>)</font><br>
      He derives alphabet from India, which is understandable, for
      hindus do recognize vargas <font color="#cccccc">(I'm not sure
        it's the correct form, I only found it in <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varga_%28astrology%29"><font
            color="#cccccc">a</font></a>strology, but he studies
        sanskrit, so he probably knows it better)</font> while in
      western tradition this knowledge seem to be completely lost and
      only rediscovered here &amp; there and hopefully somewhere else <font
        color="#cccccc">(followin part of this research will probably
        include more guys &amp; gals excavating these corpus of human
        concepts)</font><br>

      I brought this bottle here only to satisfy my urge to collect all
      the abecedaries in one place (though I hope somebody does it

      I think some good ai should look into what that guy could find for
      of course I am biased to see clearly what he reconstructs (I read
      it researching so my head got tired when I got half through it,
      and then I read some more, though I told you not to. And I also
      typed all these (from "Today academia.edu") <br>

      Ϻ is san, such an old letter, like jewish צ for it stands there
      somewhere. But it looks like W, which as Ш<br>
      Σ does look like Ϻ rotated counter-clockwise. but it stands at
      another position, phonetically ~ the same<br>
      Ш stands even further. It's like those three forms are spread
      through the alphabet on some distances:<br>
      Z is the opposite of S (probably that's why they needed another
      stroke on Σ to rotate it into З. <font color="#cccccc">is it 3?</font><br>
      ЗΣϺШ such is the order of this abugida. Was it why they had to
      move Z closer to the E, to make intervals equal? are they equal?
      we'll check it in a moment. <br>
      Isn't E itself rotated Ш? Maybe as 2 mothers of three. <br>
      Then there should be 4 of them (one is hidden, as Y from UVW)<br>
      What is the third first? M!<br>
      З [Z] must be the fourth. twice more linguals than labials!<br>
      ЗШ are ZH of the greek alphabet?<br>
      E is in the same line!<br>
      F, f? or Θ, θ? (I was looking for the labial, and both letters
      which are left are labial. was it an attempt to make the count
      even? <br>
      like if linguals are doubled, let's double the labials too? thus
      MN? PQ bothe N &amp; Q are still linguals, but they could have
      that M pronounce to them, so could russian юсы &amp; french nasals
      be of that origin?)<br>
      We russians we didn't care if it was F<font color="#cccccc">f</font>
      or Θ<font color="#cccccc">θ</font>, we drew both as Ѳ<font
        color="#cccccc">ѳ</font> and draw as Ф<font color="#cccccc">ф</font>
      today. Θεά is Фея<br>
      <font color="#666666">(I think I should notice that more usually
        (for more modern words) they use Т instead of Ф </font><br>
      Θ looks like ט in jewish alphabet. And ט is recognized directly as
      T. <a href="mirrors/%CE%B8.mp4">Θ</a> is taught to be T in uni<font
        color="#999999">versi</font><font color="#cccccc">ties.</font><br>
      <br>
      So second row in greek is three mothers? <font color="#cccccc">and




        fourth additional one. And somethimes there are 6 of&nbsp; 'em</font><br>
      Then every other line is three mothers.<br>
      We saw it in ABC (<span title="" class=""><span

      ᚦ standing for both d &amp; D shows that boustrophedon is

      ᚦ (þ probably is [<span title="Representation in the International

          in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">θ</span></span>]
      in icelandic but Δ is [ð] in greek. was it the exact pair how
      linguals doubled in voiced &amp; voiceless? For M &amp; W are
      always M &amp; W then F is V? no, there was not W when F was V for
      it was the W, as they transcribe it in phoenician. But do they
      translate it correctly? I should really sustain modern writing
      traditions, restraining from ancient reconstructed ones, for
      mistake is always there just as here I probably make many;)<br>
      one of them could well just be coming up. take it as poetry.,
      etymologic dictionaries have mistakes too.<br>
      <br>
      Is "to die" like an euphemism? Like "to dye" like with your blood.
      And even if you fall, bleed somewhere else, don't dye the furs of
      tiger, mammoth or whoever gotcha. Or whatever they wear, like not
      to smell of blood, not to disturb the animals, not to let them
      smell you. So hunters wore furs initially just to cover their
      smell with smell of that animal whose skin they put upon? To steal
      u stealthly. It's a horror bably, the ancient horror of stealing
      cubs wearing their mother's skin. boy, wicked.<br>
      See how baby is related to babble. babbling babbly baby babé<br>
      <br>
      Dubious? Maybe. But it will help foreigners to never forget the
      word babble. Petersonian truth, huh<br>

      those russian flags, meh, I should start using memeflags, as a
      protest agains russian government supporting commie regimes across
      the globe, for themselves secretly being a commie regime.<br>
      They have some nerve, or they just didn't read Milton Friedman
      scientifically proving that the less state intervenes the economy,
      the better is the economy. He did it through centuries &amp;
      continents, but I onlly read some of his short ones when I was
      around 17, and I got it instantly, because I had the bright
      example of soviet economy before me <font color="#666666">(don't
        trust their propaganda or statistics. numbers for 1983-1988 were
        published in 1982 </font><font color="#999999">(I don't
        remember the exact years, they depend on their five-year plan.
        So they published digits they planned to achieve, but as far as
        I know, not a single plan was fulfilled))</font> though if I
      didn't read or heard of his research, I would think soviet decay
      was caused by discouragement of initiative &amp; free enterprise,
      but he made even broader conclusion, I think he's right, because
      in today's beautiful russsia of the future government doesn't
      prohibit free enterprise, but they regulate it to near-death and
      those regulation are also corruptly arbitrary which actually can
      be both good and bad for any special case, but it's all not
      helping the common economy, au contraire.<br>

      And though these things may be more important than what we
      research here, there might be some political games, but luckily
      not for long. Their service is no longer needed and will be
      substituted with ai-powered society of free entrepreneurs. or
      maybe we all won't even have to hustle for entrepreneurs among us
      will take care of communities around them, providing free place
      &amp; power to create our own food by printing them, while those
      entrepreneurs' ais would be surveilling his neighbours via
      microscopic spy-drones that nobody produces too much of explosives
      or doing some other dangerous stuff. and thus those entrepreneurs
      would be watching eachother, keeping their surveillance in open
      sometimes, so everybody is watching eachother and hivemind
      whatever challenge they're facing, so no big daddy or big brother
      is needed anymore. It's not even that much of the future, it's the

      OPRST (as it is in russian &amp; greek)<br>
      Greeks used to have Ϻ where lating has Q and in variants closer to
      phoenician, also Ϙ after Ϻ<br>
      <font color="#999999">These addditional letters made sense for
        together with Ϝ it addded alphabet up to 27 which was 9+9+9,
        which was their numeral system of 999 similar to roman numerals
        because both had cycle in 1000.<br>
        I wrote about it before, they used overlines to multiply numbers
        by powers of 1000.</font><br>
      So they didn't even need sampi, which makes me think hm.. have
      sampi (ϡ) ever existed? Isn't it San sent to the back of the chart
      as they did to many other letters? And the following image says ϡ
      could be exactly Ϻ, and another one tells that Ϻ could be exactly
      Σ:<br>

      &nbsp;AEOLIA has to be special. It consists almost completely of
      vowels, and their order is AEO, very alphabetic.<br>
      <br>
      IONIA also includes only one consonant, but Aeolia has more of
      them, and L is somewhat more vowel, even though N looks like И
      &amp; H is its invariant is vowel in greek and И used to be H. <br>
      L looks like I though. Ionia &amp; Aeolia are such similar names,
      as if they are dialects of the same thing. Like yea, they're both
      greek dialects. But how could Ionia be even not in Athen's, but in
      Anatolia, how could its dialect become the official one?<br>
