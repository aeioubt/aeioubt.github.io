          them somewhat less. Though soil, not air is the more common
          among elemental systems, what if it's the both. Air is the
          product of the earth, without the soil there would be no air.
          And ש is the chaotic energy which is some other force, and it
          makes us guests from space? Otherwise we would be the Earth

          And I go on with my research: <br>
          Х ~ Ж if we recognize X as stavless Ж, ᚷ as stavless ᚼ<br>
          Also because J can be read as Ж [j] in french, but as ᚷ [h] in
          spanish<br>
          And position of russian Ж correlate greek H (and Z is after
          it, not in front as in greek. So does it make greek later
          relating to russian? In russian second row Z stands in the
          end, not in the front, but do russians have F after E? No, but
          Ё. (I spoke about it whether in this version or look for older
          ones in web archive)<br>
          <br>
          ᚷ as stavless ᚼ exp;ains hot ~ жара and makes me believe
          that's the same t as in to, which comes ть in russian &amp; る
          in japanese. (I)t seems to come ra in russian, while in verbs

          I think I found my H, as bekar after b, notice how ♮ resembles
          h, so it could be the source of the B/H misnomination, but I

          Surprise is that in my own city lives another kid who've found
          something incredible in russian alphabet:<br>
          <a href="https://roouh.livejournal.com/133411.html"><img
              src="III_files/58102_800.png" alt="" width="800"

          <br>
          We see K breaking sequence once again (does it mean it wasn't
          tabooed, it wasn't invented in those ancient abecedarias of
          some archaic latin <font color="#999999">(I'm not sure that
            period is named archaic, you look it up yourself if you care
            of the exact taxonomy)</font><br>
          Also П can be an invariant of R which would go farting (the
          sound only some most ancient native americans lost in the
          jungle speak this sound. That 3-vowel tribe, I wrote about
          them, I don't remember the name.<br>
          This sequence of voiced-sonors-voiceless. Is not present in
          english, but we know that G is invariant of C and that C used
          to sound like G, at least I read it. <br>
          It is arranged as if students begin loud and clear in voiced
          forms of the letters, but getting tired their voices became
          less clear until it switched off completely and only wisper
          would come out. O &amp; especially У are way more tired than A
          &amp; E, vowels could also influence the enthusiasm of
          pronunciation. So it could be either appear this way
          naturally, or be arranged this way to ease the reading of the
          alphabet. <br>
          Let's see if such a sequence is present in any of other

            with roouh that what we have here is three groups, for ЙЛМНР
            are all named sonors: [jlmnr] but I'd rather believe that
            they're untuned by insertion of K and originally there was
            no K &amp; they all were voiced. Then R is also out of
            sequence, and as K &amp; R are graphically similar, it seems
            we found another key to this clockwork, for I always
            wondered how could it be that P is R in russian? Bornholm
            runic alphabet also doesn't have P, so I think R used to be
            lingual "fart". <br>

          R is also secondary, because there are more important letters<br>

          is somewhere near greek: <br>
          the only difference is that postionian greek doesn't see H as
          [h]<br>
          and that hebrew includes some additional letters (surprise!)
          but <br>
          they are voiceless, so who knows maybe it tells that they
          follow <br>
          this voiced-voicelss tendency more.<br>
          <br>
          So is it just a coincidence, which became quasi-structure in
          one<br>
          of them, or is it common among all of them one way or another.<br>
          I would look for some structural tendency if latin shows no<br>
          tendency of having more voiced in the first half.<br>
          <br>
          But P instead of B, T instead of D, I think this
          voiced-voiceless is set from the initial ABD/VFH <br>
          but let's conduct the experiment:<br>
          <br>
          A <font color="#ff0000">B</font> <font color="#33cc00">C</font>
          <font color="#ff0000">D</font> E <font color="#33cc00">F</font>

          <br>
          Еven in latin second half has more voiceless letters, but it's
          on the brink of losing this tendency completely:<br>
          First half contains 4 voiceless: CFHK<br>
          Second half contains 5 voiceless: PQSTX <font color="#cccccc">(even















































































































            though the second half as we broke it is 2 letters shorter)</font><br>
          And if we cound voiced, then <br>
          First half contains 7 voiced: BDGJLMN<br>
          Second half contains 5 voiced: RVWYZ (and if we count VW as 1
          &amp; Y as vowel, even less: 3)<br>
          But if we remember that LMN are the beginning of the second
          half of the alphabet (as official etymology of "element"
          tells) then it's only 4 voiced in the first half, and even if
          we exclude W &amp; Y it's 6 against 4, which breaks the
          tendency. <br>

          well, in this case first half has 5 voiced, and the second -
          only 4 (but if we turn W back on?)<br>
          <br>
          It could also happen this way in latin because of some reform
          of sharing the voiced through the structure, not to make the
          pyramid way to obvious that bottom doesn't have a say.<br>
          <br>
          Anyway, latin is an exception among those I've seen above,
          let's look into georgian alphabet, to see if it's just some
          hellenic fluctuation or some truer symmetry, which could be
          cause by BD PT of some ancient unknown alphabet, mama first
          papa second, baba dada also go this way, and if some southern
          nations call papa baba, this deserves its own research.<br>
          <br>
          The reason I throw away R &amp; not P is because the grapheme
          P is known in both latin &amp; russian <font color="#666666">&amp;















































































































            greek,</font> while R is only in latin. Also cursive k is
          even more similar to R than K and we need P as labial in our
          common structure of ABCD (notice that ABC also has voiced
          before voiceless) <br>
          then russians have П but no Р (could russian Р be invariant of
          П as if it's voiced form, even though it wasn't voice but
          bright vibration of lips. So could be R voiceless too (then we
          don't have to exclude it here) for it's brightness is not
          necessary on vocal cords, for it comes from tongue &amp;
          alveols?<br>

          Surprisingly, in georgian voiced-voiceless tendency is less
          preserved than even in greek &amp; hebrew <br>
          <font color="#cccccc">(or is it, on contrary, promoted) </font>for















































































































          not only R but several other voiced letters appear in the
          second half.<br>
          Still it's more obvious than in latin, especially if we split
          it as it is, however we break it the most of voiceless are in
          the second half. But if M is the central letter, both halves
          have the same ammount of voiced.<br>
          <br>
          In conclusion to this paragraph I have to say that this
          tendency is definitely present, but if it's artificially
          conceived or has it occured naturally this is almost
          impossible to say, probably reformers of russian alphabet
          noticed this tendency and fostered it a little.<br>
          <br>
          This tendency also supports the idea of russian В being placed
          in the place of F, for it could be voiced before, they say it
          used to be W - semitic vav is voiced. And В looks like θ which
          used to belong somethere.<br>
          <br>
          Let's look at all of the sudden spectacular russian if we
          consider Р [r] voiceless (whisper of r is r)<br>

            it's only K out of structure. And the border exactly where

          just as I couldn't figure out the ancient linguistic
          understanding of linguals (made by tongue) wandering among
          alveolar, dental, so was that guy mislead by knowing too much.
          Sonors, huh.<br>
          Though If I understand Р <font color="#cccccc">(Russian R
            looks like P)</font> as voiceless because it's whispering
          has no pair, and thus voiceless M is also M. while voiceless
          BDGJVZ are PTKCFS <font color="#cccccc">(C here is Ch, for
            only K is always K)</font> <br>

          was it logic of those who placed sonors among voiced &amp;
          voiceless? let's look at those sonors:<br>

          <br>
          and in halves:<br>
          А <font color="#ff0000">Б В Г Д</font> Е Ё <font
            color="#ff0000">Ж З</font> И <font color="#3333ff">Й</font>

          <br>
          and I was thinking the other day: " what if Ф is initial form
          of P, because there's no Ф in latin, but that's not what my
          thought began with. I began with looking at runic labials: ᛒᚠᛉ
          and even ᚢ all are dual. except P, which is neither in the
          bornolm runic alphabet (named by von List as armanen runes) <br>
          So what if these two rows are voiced &amp; voiceless and as
          genomic apparatus checks for mutations comparing two strings,
          we can reconstruct earlier phonetics of those alphabetic
          signs.<br>

          <br>
          There's now now labial after У, but only because there's no
          labial after EЁ <br>
          but it's F after E, and it's Ф after У<br>
          but Ф is already used. but what's use of the two voiced after
          O? Ф may be used instead of P, then why П?<br>
          let's look at latin once again:<br>
          <br>

          most of the voiced mess is in the final line (we russians have
          all final line of vowels, what is your voiced)<br>
          so let's look at it in the ancient form:<br>

          what is it? two octaves? but they're in sixs, not sevens.
          could it be related to 6 being so popular among heathens? Are

          further reform (maybe even from some other confession)<br>

            in hebrew)</font><br>
          then B is doubel b <font color="#cccccc">(B is v in russian,
            Б is b)</font><br>
          so now there's 8 of them. could it be where the word octave
          comes from?<br>
          <br>
          now these two lines are in abcd mode. let's look if they can
          be in axial:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <font color="#ff0000"><br>
            &nbsp; B&nbsp;</font> <font color="#ff0000">G</font> <br>
          <font color="#ff0000">D</font>&nbsp; O&nbsp; <font
            color="#33cc00"><font color="#33cc00">Ф</font> <br>
            &nbsp; Q</font><font color="#33cc00">&nbsp; T</font><br>
          <br>
          actually yes. and V is envoked by it.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <font color="#ff0000"><br>
            &nbsp; B&nbsp;</font> <font color="#ff0000">G</font> <br>
          <font color="#ff0000">D</font>&nbsp; O&nbsp; <font
            color="#33cc00"><font color="#33cc00">P</font> <br>
            &nbsp; Q</font><font color="#33cc00">&nbsp; T</font><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Shouldn't I make up my mind if V is labial consonant or vowel?
          But it is both, in different cultures it's both, and sometimes
          it's in the same culture both (as vav in semitic languages,
          even though both lineal &amp; axial symmetries recognize vav
          as labial consonant, and maybe that's why both و &amp; ו stand
          for "&amp;" and both are consonant labials: و is wъ, ו is v,
          and we can see that more modern arabic has drifted more
          towards vowel u, and today ו can be used also for u &amp; o,
          but to make it o (literally "or") we have to put aleph before
          it: או, which reminds me of יהוה being transliterated as Io,
          which reminds both greek deity (and I'm not exactly sure it's
          the same Io whose priestess invented alphabet, but wth, of
          course it's her) and polynesian highest deity of a cult very
          similar to judaism, I think I've already wrote about it, and I
          think I wrote that ה makes ' &amp; ו vowels, but isn't י vowel
          by default? Those who know hebrew probably laugh at me right
          now.<br>
          <br>
          that abgd-opqt pair keeps v vowel, and yet I'm not sure this
          reconstruction reconstructs any representation actually
          existing in the past, roouh begins with one ancient russian
          abecedary, and look at it, it breaks the alphabet in half
          exactly between voiced &amp; voiceless (wonderful thing is
          that k is missing, and it doesn't seem to have enough space
          for k:<br>

          though it could be a coincidence, because he puts о in the

          voiced-voiceless order is the original one (it's more present
          in hebrew, than it is in latin, and it is somewhat general
          that voiced tend to gather in the beginning of the alphabet (B
          is voiced, K is not, so now let's look how it is in eastern
          ones:<br>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hentaigana"><img
              src="III_files/Hentaigana.png" alt="" width="1009"
              border="0" height="607"></a><br>
          <br>
          they all are voiceless by default and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakuten_and_handakuten">゛</a>
          makes it voiced (only the sonor ones are voiced already: m, n,
          l/r<br>
          wait a minute, there are more of those: it goes a ka sa ta na
          ha ma ya ra wa n<br>
          <br>
          <img src="III_files/hiragana3.gif" alt="" width="502"
            align="left" height="623"><img src="III_files/katakana3.gif"
            alt="" width="502" height="624"><br>
          <br>
          so it's definitely voiceless (those to which ゛ can be applied)
          in the front, sonors (voiced by default) in the back. it
          breaks between ta &amp; na &amp; only ha goes exceptional, and
          it is exceptional, because it can be applied with&nbsp; ﾟ to
          make p- but it's b when ゛ is on it's right upper corner, but
          it's more funny than this, because that ha is more weird than
          that: it's wa most of the time: boku wa baka gaijin desu,
          sumimasen, this wa is actually that very ha, so if it's wrong
          that it's ha or not, it's exceptional, and other than that
          mayarawan are all sonors, and kasata are once again remind
          second half of the first raw: as if ha was replaced from it's
          honorable position. ahakasata - is it how it was? because I
          was already seeing things like aka satana (akai is red in
          japanese, and -i suffix is the same as russians use for
          adjectives, and russians sometimes just don't use that suffix
          to create so called "short adjectives" which may tell that
          adjectives are as ancient as nouns and verbs. red can be even
          more primal than raid. <br>
          <br>
          But back on track, what I wanted to say is<br>
          <font size="+2"><font size="+2">א<font color="#ff0000"> ב ג ד

          as four representations of the same two letters, as
          sillabaries do, but this time with only 4 vowels &amp; 2
          consonants, even before 5 vowels, B and T<br>
          You can notice that this way they're grouped according to IPA
          into plosive, fricative, nasal, whisper. <font
            color="#cccccc">IPA puts B&amp;D in the same group, and
            D&amp;T too, so I named those voiceless whispers by miself.
          </font>Which may witness something about the jewish vowels
          themselves. Is O a wisper form of A? Because <font size="+2"><font
              size="+2">ע</font></font> is related to O. It could be
          more related to У, but it stands at O position. Though if we
          compare the final line of jewish alphabet with У line, we get
          У as <font size="+2"><font size="+2">ע</font></font> and Ф as
          <font size="+2"><font size="+2">פ</font></font> which is
          direct transliteration and Х as <font size="+2"><font
              size="+2">צ</font></font> which is weird, though cursive <font
            size="+2"><font size="+2">צ</font></font> looks like З
          (there's no unicode for cursive, so watch it up in that .odo
          addon) and initial X does sound like Z. Ц as <font size="+2"><font
              size="+2">ק</font></font> which is equally weird, though C
          could stand for both, Ч for <font size="+2"><font size="+2">ר</font></font>
          which is quite a coincidence, because cursive ч looks exactly
          like cursive r - is it why they call it cursive? as of curse,
          the script which made them misunderstand one another, tour as
          cour? Ш <font size="+2"><font size="+2">ש</font></font> which

          because we don't have these two in russian (is it an argument
          enough? but what if russians had alphabetic canon before
          christians, and though I only shyly attempted to notice this
          possibility (because they were caught redhanded in this sort
          of crime of claiming authority over something they didn't
          author)<br>
          after that it was clear that&nbsp; has to go (because bornholm
          alphabet's first row only has ᛒᚦ instead of BCD, because of b
          d symmetry shining on so many levels: BD, БД, ⰂⰄ, 𓃀𓂧 and
          even <font size="+2"><font size="+2">בד</font></font> are
          probably here, but сСГⰃ(𓈎𓎡𓎼)ג never plays this game, which
          makes me think it should go from the protoalphabet (it also
          didn't exist in that mythic 5 vowels, B &amp; T, and also only
          latin alphabet has velar column distinctly, unlike the others)<br>
          I knew M had to go first, an we still have N following, which
          marks L as invariant of I further in history than N as
          invariant of I (И) if it even is, for if it is, M must be an
          invariant of И too, which would be super weird, because I is
          lingual, and M is labial. but AIU correlate AMT if you even
          know what I mean, I think it's one of those moments when I'm
          so high in that depth, that even me won't be able to make
          sense of this.<br>
          So here I already had a distinct pattern, so to determine
          which of many voiceless sounds of the fourth and final row go
          into my reconstruction of protoalphabet wasn't difficult at
          all. P &amp; T of course. which is kinda sad, because I

      Roman secunda is 24 times longer than ours<br>
      Does it mean one hour in their system was a term for a day? <br>
      Година is hour in ukrainian, but year in russian: год is year to
      be precise, so russians would understand година as год.<br>
      Is it why "сейчас" (now) is more likely to mean "сегодня, сего
      дня" (today) than "сей час" (this hour, tohour) - well, no, сейчас
      сегодня собраны по одному принципу. сей и сего - просто в разных
      падежах. Но разве разница в падежах не являет иную грамматическую
      форму? если бы их собирали одновременно, то сейчас, сейдень.
      "Сегодня" более изысканно флектуатическая структура, а значит она
      с некоторой вероятностью была собрана позже, потому что "сейчас"
      это китайцы так слова собирают, а они законсервировали грамматику
      на самом раннем этапе из всех что я знаю. И я считаю что это
      свидетельствует о древности их письменности и языка. Could

        me, fuck ''''s, co is not russian ко, к, semantically they are
        different. but "на хуй" (на ~ к) has semantic values of go, So I

      but back to that outstanding claim that prepositions have verbal
      meanings:<br>
      пере = пр(ыгай) (s)pr(ing) pr(one) (прыгает на)<br>

      у- stands for something like away (and for way in "way (too big)")
      notice that it's у [u] common between away &amp; out, which in
      russian is вон, прочь, от as direct cognate of out, which corelate
      it with off and of.<br>
      Which made me think of u- (especially initial one, or even any
      initial vowel) to inverse what follows: out = of, idi = go (idi is
      go in russsin: иди) and there probably were some other examples. I
      reallly have to scan those notebooks. that very k appears in

                  brave approach I offered here, comparing all the
                  languages globally, ignoring all the human-made
                  definitions, reconstructions &amp; divisions into
                  families or whatever. And then maybe even other
                  animals' languages will be compared with ours.</span></span></span></span></span></span>

      This alphabet which is persian, not arabic (arabic lack few of
      these)<br>

      is also alphabetic if you watch at the first letters in the
      groups:<br>

        color="#ff0000">ی</font><br>
      <br>
      all I was going to say is <font color="#ff0000">ه</font> و look
      like E F when they're written in a different font: <font
        color="#ff0000">ه</font>و<br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">(you should try to type mixing hebrew or
        arabic with latin or russian, it's a mindf<br>
        <font color="#ff0000">----use this merged coloured hu in
          .odo-----</font><br>
      </font> <br>
      Notice that having removed the doublets, we got ourselves 18
      letters, which is a magic number of 3 sects<br>
      (sects are aettir but of 6s)<br>
      sso is 6s &amp; 8s the same old war for geometric forms (arabs
      adore 8-poiinted star (it's united) while jews prefer 6-pointed
      star (it's separated) <br>
      6-pointed star is probably historically more ancient (it's both
      less points, 18-letter alphabets are older than 24-letter ones,
      judaism is older than islam) but 8-pointed is also a cross. and
      sun shines mostly across (but it's because of the effect our
      eyelashes create (because sun rotates together with our head, and
      the cross is seen when eyes are half-closed, otherwise sun goes
      all the way)<br>
      <br>
      The idea of separation of the alphabet into voiced &amp; voiceless
      can be used as an instrument to deliver the previous form of the
      alphabet:<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#ff0000">ا</font> <font color="#3366ff">ب</font> ج د
      ر س ص ط <font color="#ff0000">ع</font><font color="#3366ff"> ف</font>
      ق ک ل <font color="#3366ff"> م</font> <font color="#000099">ن</font>
      <font color="#ff0000">ه</font> <font color="#33ffff">و</font> <font
        color="#ff0000">ی</font><br>
      <br>
      First I noticed that this way we have vowels in the end (as
      russians coplete it, as greeks had omega, as runic alphabet had ᚢ
      (v, u (oo)) and roman alphabet had V, v (v, u) and russian
      alphabet had Ѵ, ѵ as finals)<br>
      And just before those vowels ن [n] stands and in greek minuscule
      [n] is <span title="Greek language text" lang="el">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        <span title="Greek language text" lang="el">ν</span></span><br>
      and after jewish <font size="+2"><font size="+2">נ</font></font>
      [n] stands <font size="+2">ס</font> which looks just like ه -
      could there be some cultureal correlation (and the script is of
      the same size, but hebrew is extra large in the text, otherwise it
      was really small, and arabic is in normal size (as is all this
      text) let's make it extra extra large and compare them:<br>
      <font color="#ff0000" size="+3">ا</font><font size="+3"> <font
          color="#3366ff">ب</font> ج د ر س ص ط <font color="#ff0000">ع</font><font

      <font size="+3">ا</font><font size="+3"> ب ج د ر س ص ط ع ف ق ک ل م
        ن ه و ی</font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size="+3">ه</font> stands where <font size="+2">ס</font>
      does. and they look the same, and I hate to diss your concealium,
      consealium, what is the word.. concilium, but I must notice that
      after n o fololows, and it looks exactly like <font size="+3">ه</font>
      and <font size="+2">ס</font> especially if you know they're
      backwards. So who's reading those texts wrong all the time?<br>
      <font size="+3">ه</font> is definitely closer to o than <font
        size="+2">ס</font>, especially if you transliterate it into
      jewish <font size="+2"><font size="+2">ה</font></font> which
      stands where e does, not o. but in arabic even though <font
        size="+3">ه</font> is closer to vowers than <font size="+2">ס</font>
      is, which also reminds greek σ - which resembles o just
      strikingly! and σ has it's own story of how Σ looks like E and
      that school=ecole, student=etudiant, and some more examples of the
      kind there is. scream just gets rid of s or e, and it's <span
        class="gt-baf-cell gt-baf-word-clickable">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;

            gt-baf-word-clickable">cri<br>
            and even though it's not greek, but french, just as sign
            languages don't correlate speaking languages, so writing
            systems can be not corresponding with the languages they're
            used for, hence this babelonian mess I'm disentangling here.<br>
          </span></span></span><br>
      and ◯ could be a holy symbol, named by different nations
      differently, and thus... just a speculation<br>
      but if <font size="+3"> ه</font> is sun, <font size="+3">و</font>
      can be the moon<br>
      and they stand together in the second row, where E &amp; F do, and
      F is moon, because it's not always full.<br>
      and F is connected with fornication, and moon is the night, which
      is more proper for sex, and it's literally 6<br>
      and 6 looks like <font size="+3">و</font>, though 9 would fit
      more. And if we count it backwards from <font size="+3">و</font>,
      we may find that if <font size="+3">و</font> is 9, then 1 is <font
        size="+3">ع</font> which opens the second half of the alphabet,
      only it not begins, but ends with LMN. And it's 10 of them in that
      second half, and the first half is of 8, and if we abruptly
      exclude 9 &amp; 10 from the second half, we'll get alphabet of 16,
      as that "younger futhark" - I believe it's literally younger than
      it's older form, like when the system wasn't developed enough,
      when it was young. see the mindf/?&nbsp; <br>
      and the final letter looks like 。 which is as ◯ named maru. and 。
      is japanese . and dot is how one of ugaritic alphabets end (I
      never saw the artefact they took it from, but it's there, in their
      literature, I guess. <br>
      <img src="III_files/ugaritic.png" alt="" width="1163" height="600"><br>
      So if <font size="+3"> ه</font> is a dot, <font size="+3">و</font>&nbsp;


































































































      can be a comma. And whatever <font size="+3">ی</font> is, it can
      be wind if <font size="+3"> ه</font> and <font size="+3">و</font>&nbsp;


































































































      are sun &amp; moon. <br>
      (in one russian fairytail a prince asked from sun, from moon &amp;
      from the wind. Are that another representation of trinity? saint
      spirit is similar to wind. but son as sun seems to be related as
      heresy by older religions, father is the king, that's the old
      order, son only transmits its will (even when king is dead, he was
      deity ever-living), then son is not sun, but moon, man he is.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">But back on track, why don't I go further
        and don't compare <font size="+3">ع</font> to three? why stop
        where it's convenient? have I ever stopped? then I'd call <font
          size="+3">ا</font> the 1, then I'd see nothing better than to
        name <font size="+3">ج</font> the 2? then <font size="+3">ط</font>
        the four? nah... though I think I saw something of the kind
        somewhere (here I wanted to dig deeper, but no, this path, if it
        even exists is still too early for me, I've already bought books
        on history of numbers, so I must read them, but I have so many
        thing to do, so I must go on train to make myself read.) </font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="+3">و</font>&nbsp; can be a comma especially because
      it stands for "and" <br>
      <br>
      LMN ending the alphabet makes another sense because it ends it
      with aMeN<br>
      and alumin is a joking mocking of аминь, but that as I heard it,
      aluminum was considered the most precious until we figured out how
      to extract it. alumni is also a word meaning of which I still
      don't know... <br>

      But let me finish this topic before I go away:<br>
      <font size="+3">ا</font><font size="+3"> <font color="#ff0000">ب
          ج د ر</font> <font color="#33cc00">س ص ط</font> ع <font

        ه <font color="#ff0000">و</font> ی</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
        color="#cccccc">(red are voiced, green are voiceless)</font><br>
      First i wanted to guess that <font color="#33cc00" size="+3">س ص
        ط</font> are some ignorant extras, so applying that
      voiced-voiceless thing we can replace them and<font size="+3"> <font
          color="#ff0000">ل م ن</font> ه <font color="#ff0000">و</font>
        ی</font>&nbsp; too, but now I see: what if their structure was
      to keep silents inside and voiced outside? Doesn't it make sense?
      It does. So hail diversity, or something, let all the flowers
      bloom, some of them may happen to be of youth and you don't know
      which (use, not youth, but I cherish typos, and this one can be
      exactly right: some flowers can be of youth, and we don't know
      which. and even when we gain the eternal youth, those flowers
      still can be of use to us in the eternal future it's for sure) <br>
      <br>
      Why did I remove all those dotted invariants? Because inclusion of
      those ones disrupts the structures in european alphabet, ancient
      texts are reported to include no dots. at least in hebrew, I'm not
      sure of runes.<br>
      <br>
      I think I already mentioned it somewhere before, but this sequence
      also has la<font color="#33ccff">b</font>ials after v<font
        color="#ff0000">o</font>wels:<br>
      &nbsp;<font color="#ff0000" size="+3">ا</font><font size="+3"> <font

        <font color="#33ccff">و</font> <font color="#ff0000">ی</font></font><br>
      and again <font size="+3">م</font> is the exception, yet even <font
        size="+3">و</font> is preceded by <font size="+3">ه</font>,
      which makes me think that <font size="+3">ی</font> could be
      lingual y before. As if this sequence was before. hm.. anyway if <font
        size="+3">ی</font> is vowel in that end, it puts him along with
      greek. Though that shout.. shourt.. short like ..line is weird,
      the same is in gu.. ugaritic. I'm also hungry now, goeedbye...
      notice how that very i-line is collected in the end, as if it's
      the newest, the most disrupted too.<br>
      <br>
      Notice, that <font size="+3">ه</font> isn't actually vowel in
      modern arabic, and <font size="+3">ی</font> can be shortened to
      й, the [j] and only <font size="+3">ا</font><font size="+3"> </font>and<font
        size="+3"> ع</font> are always vowels. <font size="+3">و</font>&nbsp;


































































































      too can be vowel, but just as <font size="+3">ی</font>, not
      always, so these final two also make a pair, a pair of
      semi-vowels. and <font size="+3">ه</font> is probably one of
      them, though it's never vowel in arabic, it's always vowel in
      hebrew, and always vowel in greek, latin, and all the others
      actually.<br>
      <br>
      I didn't find much when I looked for <font size="+3">ع</font>
      being the same sign as 3, but it's also the same sign as E. And
      both are followed with fey, and b is for бог/ so are these just
      male &amp; female pairs (which makes sense: women historically
      (and actually physiologically) had less voice (half of that of a
      man in shariah court) and yet vowels were named female letters,
      and females managed to have more vowels, and more letters than man
      (as they have bigger attention to nuances, just as they have names
      for more colours than guys usually do) and more labials are on
      their side (the ratio is the same as with vowels. And isn't it the
      answer to why there are three mothers, but four or five labials? B
      is Babushka, the Granny (B &amp; G the same again. Бог Господь)<br>
      Granny can be kinder than mother, because she's way less disturbed
      with freudian bs, and mothers often have no idea how to treat
      their children, once again, it's just a speculation, something can
      happen out of it, I have long went into draft mode, if you want
      something more certain you should probably stick to the first
      volume, and even there be cautious of my usual liberties. Feя,
      Mother, Vulva? I'm only guessing, looking for the most female
      words. Female, Fe in that word plays the same role as Wo in Women.
      Here Wo sounds as We probably because We is actually a plural form
      of Wo () which tells a story of that word being of female origin.

        Интересной особенностью чукотского языка является то, что
        женщины и мужчины говорят по-разному. Для женщин существует табу
        на произнесение имён родственников мужа и похоже звучащих
        слов[5]. Разница существует также и в произношении обычных слов.
        Там, где мужчины произносят звук «р» или сочетание «рк», женщины
        произносят звук «ц» или «цц». Например, «морж» в мужском
        произношении звучит как «рыркы», а в женском — как «цыццы»[6].
        Другие примеры: мужчинами произносится ч, женщинами — ц:
        чайвыгыргын (муж.), цайвыгыццын (жен.) (в предложении
        Чайвыгыргын мыгитэгъэн! / Цайвыгыццын мыгитэгъэн!) или
        чайвыгыргын рэгитэӈэ (муж.) — цайвыгыццын цэгитэӈэ (жен.); «с»
        также может заменяться на «ц»: мылгынутэсӄык панрэвкы (муж.) —
        мылгынутэцӄык панцэвкы (жен.) (в предложении Тыӄэӈавытыйӈын
        мылгынутэсӄык панрэвкы вальык нымӈиӄин / Тыӄэӈавытыйӈын
        мылгынутэцӄык панцэвкы вальык нымӈиӄин)[7]. <br>

      но где-то эта третья форма использовалась для второго лица? ты!
      да, это не вежливо, но до сих пор иногда применяется, когда тыкают
      в человека пальцем и спрашивают у него "он что думал?"<br>
      H is in переменном ряду (в разных алфавитах он по разному себя
      ведёт, иногда этой буквы нет)<br>
      Зная форму рунической ᚷ которая может быть staveless ᚼ&nbsp;
      предполагаю что h в русском стала ж, как дж в английском где в
      испанском что-то типа х. Но скорей всего наоборот, в русском она
      сохранена чётче (h стоит в столбце переднеязычных (coronal) что
      говорит что она скорее ʃ чем h.<br>
      Что делает he &amp; she инвариантами, и помимо Бьорк поющей шуман
      вместо хуман, вчера слышал песню, где парень пел she там где по
      сюжету было he. что же это была за песня? а, да, самое начало
      альбома Genius/GZA "Liquid Swords" - когда маленький (и возможно
      беззубый) пацан рассказывает про своего отца, говорит he так
      словно это she. She - шепелявая (беззубая) форма he.<br>
      Но тогда he первична, что противоречит тому что я только что
      городил: dh<br>
      <br>
      ا ب پ ت ث ج چ ح خ د ذ ر ز ژ س ش ص ض ط ظ ع غ ف ق ک گ ل م ن ه و ی<br>
      <br>
      ه often looks like e, and in alphabetic symmetry ه<br>
      stands where e does. <br>
      Thus a bigger idea: what if we recognize all alphabet as
      representations of the same system, and compare letters to
      recognize their true semantic value:<br>
      <font color="#ff0000">A</font> may look as an ox (as phoenicians <font
        color="#cccccc">(phoeniciantists)</font> recognize them, but A
      &amp; 𐤀 are the closest forms, when we compare it to hebrew and
      arabic, it's somewhat different: ا of hebrew directly stands for 1
      and if you think what it can be, it's a vertical figure without
      many branches, it's a man.<br>
      but if you compare it to hebrew form, to there are two hebrew
      forms: cursive form is very related to 𐤀<br>
      (I couldn't find hebrew cursive in the unicode. I think I should
      look for it in fonts... use images for now)<br>

      ИКЛМН are all forms of alef? what a surprise! (Н is N in russian
      &amp; N is M in modern hebrew cursive)<br>
      <br>
      once again, I missed a thought:<br>
      ه often looks like e, and in alphabetic symmetry ه<br>
      stands where e does. though eee looks like ههه<br>
      but also M looks like that: م <br>
      Мmm looks like that: ممم<br>
      Which made me think "what if there's some symmetry between م &amp;
      ه ?<br>
      and this path brought me to the following representation:<br>

      is probably the cognate of ᛏ [t] ᛐ (the same t) and ᛚ [l] <br>
      ᛐ could be some form of ᛏ when all ᛚ is taken out of it, and <br>
      <br>

      the celestial bodies, but what's the 7th?) for I noticed triads in
      them in egyptian alphabet: 3 birds, 3 types of animals, 3 body
      parts, 3 parts of a circle (whole, half, quarter. and those other
      forms are in the same relation: a big, a middle, a small) anyway
      what is the fifth triad in egyptial alphabet?<br>

      Russian and English have very similar alphabets, Greek &amp; Latin
      are very alike.<br>
      So how could it happen that they have different understanding of
      the same symbols?<br>
      Why и can be written as u in russian cursive, but и [i]<br>
      Why p is read as coronal R in Russi?<br>
      Why c is sometimes s sometimes k - but this one is another thing,
      I think s is a palatalised k ~ h ~ ш<br>
      as japanese palatalised s is understood as s by some, but as sh by
      others, when it's actually sch, щ<br>
      (that swash at the right bottom corner of that щ is palatalization
      of ш - tatar alphabet has more of them.<br>

      standarts in russian they use t there. art stands as standart.

      Thus will is forward, was is before, would is wood? like if those
      three or more directions relate to elements of the world, they
      should correspond. wood is a combination of earth &amp; water, as
      would is combination of future &amp; past. which is future &amp;
      which is past? future flows, changes, undefined, past is solid and
      unchanged as much, uneluding, not dissolved in the sand, which
      acts as earth in some extent. probably people of the past saw sand
      as earth without water.. they didn't use withouts. they declared
      it as earth+fire? let's see it in chinese books:<br>

      Nope, they're using way more abstract meanings. And speaking of
      gods as abstractions in the comprehension of the masses, we may
      ponder on that later, but looking for the sand in trigrams,
      futile: <br>

      I dare to doubt that summer &amp; winter are not the opposites,
      Summer &amp; Autumn shouldn't be opposite this way as just bothe
      monograms switched. I would accept Spring &amp; Autumn as
      opposites, but not summer &amp; Autumn/ something is wrong here,
      let's see if it's structural flaw or if that immage is mistaken:<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one image told about relation of trigrams
      to hours of the day, and another one could only tell me what I
      already knew, but in another perspective, which brought it here.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So for they don't really
      know what which digram stands for, let's look into that other
      weird school we stumbled upon in volume I:<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      dry dead<br>
      some branches are dry/ m to g just came, based on the weirdest b ~
      g, which is gimel=lamed <font color="#cccccc">(upd: it's lambda,
        and the fact that greeks named their letters in female forms,
        supports the idea of greeks giving names to their letters before
        jews (a link to it is somewhere in the text, together with the
        idea of kabbalah originating in greek culture))</font>, thus
      double c is B so is it just vertical wave, and b is it's staffed
      form?<font color="#cccccc"> (if you don't understand it, I just
        read it and I didn't get it, skip such pieces freely)</font><br>
      <br>
      M ? M is B&nbsp; as Л is Г. arewn't they those wife &amp; man? <font
        color="#cccccc">I can see it requires explanation, maybe later.</font><br>
      then double Л is М and double C is B and Aᛒᚦ is ABC and D as an
      invariant of C, it's staved form.<br>
      That is why g is G in endlish, but D in russian. G is a voiced
      form of C. See, roman alphabet is latin as later for it explanes
      its form way less than runes. And did I say that clueless child
      will find runes more archaic than even archaic latin. <font
        color="#cccccc">I use archaic instead of old which is entangling
        text for non-specialists, which is a standart academic symptome
        originating in a bigger influx of second-language writers.</font><br>
      <br>
      double Л is М as double C is B <br>
      <br>
      ᚦ is a male strike with an axe. and in huntrit (let's call
      hunters' taal this way) it's man leaves such marks<br>
      ᛒ is some more information, in one blow weak man (arms as wigs)
      cannot do. Wig man is wicked witch<br>
      <br>
      so have we found the woo root in woman, wife, femakle?<br>
      <br>
      imagine how rude other words for stereotyped categories can be.
      Nigger is tabooed as we speak, but it only means black in german..
      isn't it schwarze? swarzenegger is black пахарь.. black plowman,
      ploughman, plougher. <span title="" class="">
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        <span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="de"><span
            title="" class="">Pflüger. what is negger really? I was
            brought about with that concept that schwarzenegger is
            чёрный пахарь. что было бы странно, учитывая что африканцы
            не слишком-то пашут, у них и так всё растёт. и египет
            переводят как чернозём ложно. это на арабском может египет =
            африка = чёрная земля (земля чёрных) - но возвращаясь к
            шварцу (который негрь (уголь? несгоревший или негорел..
            негрила.. не горилла? )) we humans will probably have to
            leave these old words away. and leaving in capsules we'll
            have some other features (may them be good) and gender and
            ethnicity will be the least of them/ Niger is a name of an
            african country, so my rude etymologis can be more offensive
            than the actual ones, but that's how it is heard and
            subconciously understood, so I don't know if Niger is a word
            of some african language, but it could be caught out of
            their language pool for being recognized in some european
            language wrongly but with a fun banter. <br>

      Which is an independent discovery of the same structure. And if
      before I made my best to avoid reading other books on the subject,
      to keep my research as independent <font color="#cccccc">(and
        from the mistakes of the other authors)</font> as possible.
      Recently I have felt myself way more confident and began
      spray-buying books on history of writing systems. And nobody
      seemed to see the obvious symmetries of vowels. The best I could
      buy is a collection of writing systems of the world without much
      of describing, but who really needs it on paper when it's
      hypertexted in the internet. <font color="#999999">Where you can
        also find some freaky fellows pulling texts in one language to
        another (though if we<font color="#cccccc">, russians,</font>
        read texts of older than five centuries we have problems
        understanding it)</font> so my task is to collect all the primal
      words, to compare the most simple of them, to understand the
      phonetic liberties those words allow and if something other than
      white noise emerges out of that venture, we reconstruct the
      following language from that scratch. <br>
      And the fact that this guy makes his research from scratch is an
      evidence of this field being just new born. Or I would never heard
      about him if there was no internet, so who knows how many
      independent researches like him managed to see AEIOU
      structure.&nbsp; It's so much in your face sometimes, but people
      just can't see it, it stunned me when I first witnessed it - as
      they say, there are those who see, those who see when you show
      them and those who don't see. And it's tremendous how many of
      people don't see. Those proverbal 95%.<img
        src="III_files/Scientists-and-Belief-1.gif" alt="" width="474"
        align="right" height="223"> And thus only few of us can see. So
      all the science is probably carried by those 5% of people who can
      see when they're shown. But of course even in scientific community
      they're in minority. Or am I just getting too counterproductively
      bitter? For I know that some smart people believe in god for
      whatever reasons, just as many not so bright people believe in god
      for some wrong reasons. The same people who believe in god living
      in russia <br>
      used to be atheists while they were living in ussr<br>
      <br>
      Wim J Borsboom uses the following image:<br>

      Which I missed not recognizing abecedary in it, leaving it for
      later when I speak greek.<br>
      But it is an abecedary, a plane from a set of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayum_alphabet">four</a>. <br>
      <br>
      But while I was looking for other three, I found an opinion that
      it is a forgery:<br>
      <a href="http://preearth.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=1181">http://preearth.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=1181</a>

      whether you accept or deny their arguments, it's quite a vault of
      information on the subject and a rabbit hole I maybe will descend
      further. But because forgeries are possible, I wanted to focus on
      modern forms of writing systems (for these symmetries were found
      in them, so I can research it further using only modern material.
      But public wanted me to look into what historical linguistics
      tells on the subject, even though it doesn't actually speak much
      (and half of that is false, alas))<br>
      <br>
      Wim J Borsboom brings the term Varga to the table, and gives an
      interesting guess that difference in eastern &amp; western order
      of writing systems could be caused by those vargas (labial, velar,
      coronal) misarranged by a traveller who brought them to the west
      on separate tablets. <font color="#cccccc">(he also was confused
        by some common misconceptions of consonant alphabets &amp;
        medieval origin of minuscule, which I debunked earlier, so I'll
        give him a link to this part, so he can patch his approach)</font>
      which is another explanation of that switch, that it was not by
      some religious reasons, but by mere accident <font
        color="#999999">(which I doubt, because of the reasons I gave
        before <font color="#cccccc">(greek Z for Zeus replacing Θ for

          as one of them)</font>)</font><br>
      He derives alphabet from India, which is understandable, for
      hindus do recognize vargas <font color="#cccccc">(I'm not sure
        it's the correct form, I only found it in <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varga_%28astrology%29"><font
            color="#cccccc">a</font></a>strology, but he studies
        sanskrit, so he probably knows it better)</font> while in
      western tradition this knowledge seem to be completely lost and
      only rediscovered here &amp; there and hopefully somewhere else <font
        color="#cccccc">(followin part of this research will probably
        include more guys &amp; gals excavating these corpus of human
        concepts)</font><br>

      I can only guess how the other three lines are related to it.
      Probably some scholar just compared them.<br>

      I brought this bottle here only to satisfy my urge to collect all
      the abecedaries in one place (though I hope somebody does it
      better and before me) and mostly because it represents inverted B,
      which caught my attention in roman cursive <a href="img/247.png">b</a>

      I think some good ai should look into what that guy could find for
      of course I am biased to see clearly what he reconstructs (I read
      it researching so my head got tired when I got half through it,
      and then I read some more, though I told you not to. And I also
      typed all these (from "Today academia.edu") <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">I also shall return to that reading mostly
        to understand what prevented me from comprehending his
        argumentation to maybe understand what prevent most of the
        people from comprehending mine.</font><br>
      <br>
      Ϻ is san, such an old letter, like jewish צ for it stands there
      somewhere. But it looks like W, which as Ш<br>
      Σ does look like Ϻ rotated counter-clockwise. but it stands at
      another position, phonetically ~ the same<br>
      Ш stands even further. It's like those three forms are spread
      through the alphabet on some distances:<br>
      Z is the opposite of S (probably that's why they needed another
      stroke on Σ to rotate it into З. <font color="#cccccc">is it 3?</font><br>
      ЗΣϺШ such is the order of this abugida. Was it why they had to
      move Z closer to the E, to make intervals equal? are they equal?
      we'll check it in a moment. <br>
      Isn't E itself rotated Ш? Maybe as 2 mothers of three. <br>
      Then there should be 4 of them (one is hidden, as Y from UVW)<br>
      What is the third first? M!<br>
      З [Z] must be the fourth. twice more linguals than labials!<br>
      ЗШ are ZH of the greek alphabet?<br>
      E is in the same line!<br>
      F, f? or Θ, θ? (I was looking for the labial, and both letters
      which are left are labial. was it an attempt to make the count
      even? <br>
      like if linguals are doubled, let's double the labials too? thus
      MN? PQ bothe N &amp; Q are still linguals, but they could have
      that M pronounce to them, so could russian юсы &amp; french nasals
      be of that origin?)<br>
      We russians we didn't care if it was F<font color="#cccccc">f</font>
      or Θ<font color="#cccccc">θ</font>, we drew both as Ѳ<font
        color="#cccccc">ѳ</font> and draw as Ф<font color="#cccccc">ф</font>
      today. Θεά is Фея<br>
      <font color="#666666">(I think I should notice that more usually
        (for more modern words) they use Т instead of Ф </font><br>
      Θ looks like ט in jewish alphabet. And ט is recognized directly as
      T. <a href="mirrors/%CE%B8.mp4">Θ</a> is taught to be T in uni<font
        color="#999999">versi</font><font color="#cccccc">ties.</font><br>
      <br>
      So second row in greek is three mothers? <font color="#cccccc">and













































































        fourth additional one. And somethimes there are 6 of&nbsp; 'em</font><br>
      Then every other line is three mothers.<br>
      We saw it in ABC (<span title="" class=""><span

      ᚦ standing for both d &amp; D shows that boustrophedon is
      possible. <font color="#cccccc">As we saw it before I think in
        this tome</font><br>
      ᚦ (þ probably is [<span title="Representation in the International

          in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">θ</span></span>]
      in icelandic but Δ is [ð] in greek. was it the exact pair how
      linguals doubled in voiced &amp; voiceless? For M &amp; W are
      always M &amp; W then F is V? no, there was not W when F was V for
      it was the W, as they transcribe it in phoenician. But do they
      translate it correctly? I should really sustain modern writing
      traditions, restraining from ancient reconstructed ones, for
      mistake is always there just as here I probably make many;)<br>
      one of them could well just be coming up. take it as poetry.,
      etymologic dictionaries have mistakes too.<br>
      <br>
      Is "to die" like an euphemism? Like "to dye" like with your blood.
      And even if you fall, bleed somewhere else, don't dye the furs of
      tiger, mammoth or whoever gotcha. Or whatever they wear, like not
      to smell of blood, not to disturb the animals, not to let them
      smell you. So hunters wore furs initially just to cover their
      smell with smell of that animal whose skin they put upon? To steal
      u stealthly. It's a horror bably, the ancient horror of stealing
      cubs wearing their mother's skin. boy, wicked.<br>
      See how baby is related to babble. babbling babbly baby babé<br>
      <br>
      Dubious? Maybe. But it will help foreigners to never forget the
      word babble. Petersonian truth, huh<br>

      those russian flags, meh, I should start using memeflags, as a
      protest agains russian government supporting commie regimes across
      the globe, for themselves secretly being a commie regime.<br>
      They have some nerve, or they just didn't read Milton Friedman
      scientifically proving that the less state intervenes the economy,
      the better is the economy. He did it through centuries &amp;
      continents, but I onlly read some of his short ones when I was
      around 17, and I got it instantly, because I had the bright
      example of soviet economy before me <font color="#666666">(don't
        trust their propaganda or statistics. numbers for 1983-1988 were
        published in 1982 </font><font color="#999999">(I don't
        remember the exact years, they depend on their five-year plan.
        So they published digits they planned to achieve, but as far as
        I know, not a single plan was fulfilled))</font> though if I
      didn't read or heard of his research, I would think soviet decay
      was caused by discouragement of initiative &amp; free enterprise,
      but he made even broader conclusion, I think he's right, because
      in today's beautiful russsia of the future government doesn't
      prohibit free enterprise, but they regulate it to near-death and
      those regulation are also corruptly arbitrary which actually can
      be both good and bad for any special case, but it's all not
      helping the common economy, au contraire.<br>

      And though these things may be more important than what we
      research here, there might be some political games, but luckily
      not for long. Their service is no longer needed and will be
      substituted with ai-powered society of free entrepreneurs. or
      maybe we all won't even have to hustle for entrepreneurs among us
      will take care of communities around them, providing free place
      &amp; power to create our own food by printing them, while those
      entrepreneurs' ais would be surveilling his neighbours via
      microscopic spy-drones that nobody produces too much of explosives
      or doing some other dangerous stuff. and thus those entrepreneurs
      would be watching eachother, keeping their surveillance in open
      sometimes, so everybody is watching eachother and hivemind
      whatever challenge they're facing, so no big daddy or big brother
      is needed anymore. It's not even that much of the future, it's the
      present unfolding in front of us.<br>

      OPRST (as it is in russian &amp; greek)<br>
      Greeks used to have Ϻ where lating has Q and in variants closer to
      phoenician, also Ϙ after Ϻ<br>
      <font color="#999999">These addditional letters made sense for
        together with Ϝ it addded alphabet up to 27 which was 9+9+9,
        which was their numeral system of 999 similar to roman numerals
        because both had cycle in 1000.<br>
        I wrote about it before, they used overlines to multiply numbers
        by powers of 1000.</font><br>
      So they didn't even need sampi, which makes me think hm.. have
      sampi (ϡ) ever existed? Isn't it San sent to the back of the chart
      as they did to many other letters? And the following image says ϡ
      could be exactly Ϻ, and another one tells that Ϻ could be exactly
      Σ:<br>

      &nbsp;AEOLIA has to be special. It consists almost completely of
      vowels, and their order is AEO, very alphabetic.<br>
      <br>
      IONIA also includes only one consonant, but Aeolia has more of
      them, and L is somewhat more vowel, even though N looks like И
      &amp; H is its invariant is vowel in greek and И used to be H. <br>
      L looks like I though. Ionia &amp; Aeolia are such similar names,
      as if they are dialects of the same thing. Like yea, they're both
      greek dialects. But how could Ionia be even not in Athen's, but in
      Anatolia, how could its dialect become the official one?<br>

      random discussion, a scientific discussion, because editiors could
      only read it in more or less scientific literature, and everyboy
      who knew anything about it could have its say. Imagine giving
      references to the fact that S sounds as s. I probably wouldn't.
      But if you read that M sounds as s, I would like to see some
      reference to that. What book does say about it first? In what
      text, ancient or modern is it used this way? Probably some greek
      dialect used it and thus they recognized some ancient abecedary in
      the way, but then I would liike to look inside that dialect and
      why could that ever happen that M's mistaken for Σ<br>
      <br>
      M stands above S in roman alphabet and above Σ in greek too and
      where romans had Y, greeks used Ψ.<br>
      <br>
      But let's procede with this experiment, omitting some minor

            It appears to have denoted a /ts/ sound and has been

      Okay, it's not my book already, I give references to books I never
      opened, but I just copied references of what I copied here. I
      never saw anybody did it (though they just didn't tell me, they
      copied references from the book they read, even if they didn't
      read those referenced books. I think hyperlinked text is better
      than list of references, more user-friendly, new.<br>
      Also links to public domain works instead of corrupt academic
      references easily puts me aside, as I wanna be, move along, это не
      для вас написано.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I think it's time to take a hiatus until I have some news. Not to
      stumble around sans &amp; tsadis.<br>
      <br>
      But I have the news all teh time, I have some in my notebooks, I
      tried to deliver it here, but I got distracted all the time.<br>
      <br>
      It's about <font size="+3">צ</font> ~ <b>Q</b> ~ <b>Ч</b> being
      the same letter or at least invariants:<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      San, Sigma, Sampi, could these be 666 of the greek alphabet? UVW
      is in latin, ъЫь is in russian, probably three ways to read <font
        size="+3">ו</font> is in jewish, for <font size="+3">ו</font>
      is their 6th letter, for <font size="+3">ו</font> can be read as
      v, u, o.<br>
      de Vuo? I only know the word vow consisting of these three, and
      it's a magical word.<br>
      <br>
      Previous boooks ended as christian bible, it's funny that this
      topic arised as I spoke of ending this <br>
      <br>
      No, lazybones, we're going to keep on going. <br>
      <br>
      I wonder how I never noticed that arabic و looks like roman
      cursive v. <br>
      it would look much more like it if it bound to the letter
      following to the left of it, but it is one of those letters you're
      not allowed to bind to the followings. Otherwise it stops being
      wow or what? probably.<br>
      Or just to prevent us from noticing this samenloop. I wrote in
      english, I wrote in russian. Now I will give way for Dutch. Not
      only to show off, but mostly to learn it properly, for bog ik zog<br>
      way is weg in nederlandse taal. maar boy is not bog, does it make
      weg less of a way? away is weg too.<br>
      say is seg<br>
      thus rule shouldn't appear all the time, but it is a <font
        color="#cccccc">tool or</font> event which could take place
      several times, as if instead of one word some other people loaned
      a couple of similars and twisted them both<font color="#cccccc">e</font>
      the sam<font color="#999999">w</font>e<br>
      <br>
      but some similar words are so many that you know those might be
      the originals, because notheing is more to the core of the
      language than they are. So they could be even saying more. So sort
      out the basics from later additions and compare them semantically.<br>
      <br>
      I am a native russian, so I will use russian to find those semes,
      and after taht I will compare them to other languages. I will see
      for correlations or whatever comes my way.<br>

      deeper roots: тусовать ~ тасовать. тусуй! в значении тассуй
      колоду. похоже на французское заимствование, не тусуй, а тасуй
      правильная форма, но кто её установил. тусоваться это именно что
      переходить от одной компании к другой, везде находя старых и новых
      знакомых. туси значит развейся, снеси этот ту-ту-ду-ду-ту блюз,
      cheer up!<br>

      характерно, что глаголы, что я счёл древними, закончились на т,

      но это фрикота конечно в академически заведениях не
      простиительная, потому что не все же такие крутые как ты, начнут
      нести ахинею и стройное-нестройное, какое есть, здание языкознания
      рухнет под весом собственных противоречий. Так может и не нужно
      единое здание для всех школ? пусть падают противоречивые

      What is going here and what was just above would be embarrassing

      Good thing I am not affiliated, so I can demonstrate freely how

      <br>
      к = твёрдое? камень, кость. даже придлог к подразумевает твёрдость
      (не в, но к)<br>
      тогда кость это именно твёрдая ось, в отличие от хрящей (os =
      кость. ost = кость in context)<br>

      <font color="#cccccc">But I remember another interpretation of

        and неси = на себе<br>
        and both of these make some sense, but other words won't support
        this thing.</font><br>

      doesn't it bother me that si is yes in other languages? It doesn't

      then new is among n's<br>
      It's funny that it begins with a and ands with two<br>
      and now I see where new &amp; cue (queue, que) came from (cue
      указка, кто именно. или длинное) <br>
      new &amp; que came from you. the new vowel.<br>
      imkl<br>
      because vowel, labial, velar, coronal, as in a &amp; o lines (e
      &amp; u lines show this structure less, yet they do)<br>
      j ~ y ~ v ~ u ~ и ~ n ~ g ~ q <br>
      how dows this relate to i?<br>
      it relates to f.. weeird, so weird<br>
      f as wow, for vov is bothe u &amp; v &amp; o...<br>
      but two lines ago I said it because f is digamma, and way ~
      weg&nbsp; and&nbsp; g ~ q<br>
      but I added&nbsp; ~ n ~ g ~ q only to say that you que new are the
      same word<br>
      you and que I can understand, you show with it at one from the
      crowd saying you, <br>
      but you is plural form. thee is ты&nbsp; but verb form of ты is
      тыкать. which is related to a cue.<br>
      cue = thee?<br>
      if к = зн = ж = г <br>
      all linguals are the same<br>
      at least all the basic, primal, ancient linguals.<br>
      n is new. thus g is new thus q is new<br>
      what was e-line's lingual if not g?<br>
      did e-line exist then?<br>
      because there's no velar in a-line of ancient runes (plot all you
      like but even before I saw that abc-structure of a-line in
      bornholm stone is more basic than anywhere else (maybe ugaritic
      u-line, which shows the youth of u-line in comparison to others,
      which already developed som clasters, and i-line even misplaced M,
      as they all do. So why do I treat a-line &amp; u-line differently?
      because a-line is everywhere, u-line is not.<br>
      <br>
      what are these verses? it isn't even poetry, and it is between

      more poetic, or both.<br>

      <br>
      back to those motherfuckers: won't people prefer to reproduce with

      This is because I can recognize russian words in english, but not
      in turkic languages.<br>
      Which makes me believe that nations are divided not only by facial
      features, but also by language.<br>
      And it seems these two characteristics are related to one another.
      <br>
      Finns &amp; Hungarians look more similar to us, so let's approach
      turkic languages from finno-ugric, for now I test my picture of
      the world claiming that finno-ugric are closer to indo-european
      than turkinc.<br>
      turkic is tengric? u and en both could be yuses (юсы, nasal

      oh my god, thinking of rosenthahl being european who first opened
      russian at 16 or so (or did he learn it before, I'm not sure, he
      came to russia at the age of 16, parents didn't talk russian, but
      listen to the story) imagine being european living in russia. who
      will you pledge the allegence? russia or europe? at least some of
      them are more likely to work in the sake of europe, and <font
        color="#cccccc">at</font> least some of them will be doing it by
      damaging russia. navos na qotorom groizrostayut drugie narody. so
      I just explained healthy necessity of nationalism. and if both
      rosenthal and vasmer were european foreigners, russia lost the
      first world war. Russia participated in a war against Germany.
      Little did it know that that war was against both germany &amp;
      russia. We were allies with Germany before, so Brits seduced us
      with their awesomeness, so after russia liked french (until the
      war) so we began liking english, for german we liked before, it
      was too old-fashioned. And english is objectively prettier, even
      Swedes speak English more.<br>
      So brits used russian public to make russian government change
      sides, and then they slayed as a traitor.<br>
      Rusy trusy. and duracy. two races? true si(la)? If chinese have
      hieroglyphs almonosillabary, rusi is two hieroglyphs: true &amp;
      sila <br>
      давай проверим это:<br>
      но тогда бриты руссы, а руссы бриты. Потому что английский похож

      morrow tomorrow (morning is a newer form of morrow, which is still
      present in poetry)<br>

      than deutsche morgen morgen (though<font color="#cccccc"> нутром </font>утром




































































      <font color="#cccccc">(нутром будущего?) </font>can be synonym of

      i is higher than both a &amp; w, w is the lowest, thus it was

      Hooray, I think I just found the 9-letter alphabet, the one which
      was used for calculation, until they forgot the rule to use
      strokes above letters to make bigger numbers, as I researched in
      roman numerals, I suppose it was due to some long period of
      scarcity, where people had to move and they didn't have many of
      anything with them. Jewish history could be universal scenario,
      and it could allow them merge their christian culture with local
      pagan believes, as if christians enriched them. And it could be
      happening not only with jewish torah (which remained thus
      unchanged, while heathens got centralized religion<br>

      when I smoked extract of salvia, finally it told me не осквернять

      когда я покурил её ещё раз через несколько лет, я увидел белую

      they're revealed from all the fronts, though they probably keep
      some secret trick in the rear. and though they shouldn't care too
      much for this movements wants to keep them safe and in<font
        size="-2"> </font>tact, just off their power structure, you
      think it is an option? would they crush the civilization to keep
      this ape status quo instead? what can you offer them? power of
      gods, but for everyone. even for retards? do you <font
        color="#cccccc">dind</font> find this solution sustainable? I
      find it can be sustainable if everybody is looking for everyone
      and taking care of problems before they happen. so we should trace
      the radioactivity, chemical &amp; biological activity both
      globally and locally, new forms of human society should be built
      as multi-level fortresses to ensure survival of human
      civilization. chances are technologies will find it safer to build
      underground bases in the martian caves. we have to be prepared to
      evacuate there or elsewhere, but it's the best option to save life
      and civilization on the surface of the earth, and second best
      option is in the underground of the earth and somewhere else,
      other options are disputable. So why do I consider it possible for
      shit to hit the fan? Because there's such possibility by default
      and our task is to prevent it. So why do I want to change the
      status quo? It's already changed, and keeps on changing, what I
      offer here is the safe outcome for all of us actually, not for the
      most but for the special few too. so tell me more gorgie boy, tell
      me more.)<br>
      It's fascinating that I wished to be able to write science
      fiction, which would take this reality and turns it inside out so
      you don't know if it's true or not, but the longer you look into
      it, the more it is true. And now I'm writing this very thing, and
      it is even better than science fiction, it's a scientific
      research. And this part speaking of something out of my
      speciality, what is that? that is not the most insane part of the
      book actually. And it is probably even more important than the
      rest of the book inself: if civilization falls, this obscure text
      is lost forever, unless I print it on some good cannabis paper or
      on some stone wall deep below where it will be found when they
      raise again high enough to care about archaeology.<br>
      Or is it archaeology? for I just less than a couple of hours ago
      thought that -sophy is wisdom, while -logy is lies. Yet if it once
      was true, since after then we got biology which is a very true
      science, this definition is whether obsolete or never existed. I
      will return to that civilization topic, it was not the first time
      I raised it.<br>

      man, and -le is such <img src="img/251.png" alt="" width="524"
        align="right" height="406">a common suffix (and working in this
      function) that the sign of suffix is something like ^ which is
      directly similar to Λ which is L<br>
      and forms of L &amp; Λ makes me think of abugidas, where have I
      saw such a thing other than in ancient greek music? I should
      scroll my volumes to see if I ever met them somewhere other than
      in aborigianl canadian sillabary, but L &amp; Λ are the same
      letter, just as ᚦ &amp; Д are. or even ᚦ &amp; d. bustrophaedon
      made them equal, or is it some deeper part of the fractal? for b
      used to look the other way (see roman cursive, or I will rather
      repeat them here, for I neglet images more and more, that is not
      as it should have been.<br>
      Compare that b from the third line and below. Also notice how D is
      sibilar to jewish cursive ט.<br>
      sibilar instead of similar. oh boy, am I even sue this work won't
      give me dislexia? <br>
      Of course I'm not sure, but I wil definitely find my way out of
      it. <br>
      At least it's a goal. though you know how they say "tell your
      plans to god if you want to make him or her laugh" for now it
      seems god knows better, because as for those plans of mine
      according to which it doesn't happen, reality turns into something
      even better: I don't build my autonomous house in the woods far
      away, but I got yes to build it closer to where I actually live,
      closer to where specialists in medicine and documentaries can be
      found. And all the other plans turn out into the best possible
      ways, as one of my best friends say, всё совершается
      совершеннейшим образом.<br>

      I should have put in the beginning that I am orry for all the
      trash I put in this book. A good editior would save me form the
      most of those mistakes. I was unhappy with my editors when they
      were right.<br>
      I had good editiors, I never understood their necessity until this
      very moment.<br>
      <br>
      And this part wasn't even edited by myself. Only first half of
      volume 1 is mostly rewritten from a draft. Though I made
      interventions and it was as free and poetic as these. I think it's
      what I wanted to read when I was looking for published drafts of
      great people. It seems drafts were never published. We must scan
      and index those drafts too. I'm pretty sure traces of my work are
      present in there for many times, but they didn't managed to
      decypher abcd through, so they couldn't publish it.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      So it advocates my wild and savage way of publishing my own drafts
      even if they include raw meat of uncertain genes. <br>
      Though I just recently cut out a dirty little schmuck about
      politics and what just followed instead of this text I also cut

      Back to Ogham: B &amp; H reflect eachother, as b is form of h in

      So probably b &amp; d are initial. and just as vowels are in a
      different order, but the common 5 they are,<br>
      thus D is double &amp; b is single. Мужики в основном с бабами, а

      4. Waddell, L.A.: 1927, The Aryan Origin of the Alphabet, Luzac
      &amp; Co, London <br>
      <a href="http://library.umac.mo/ebooks/b33333282.pdf">http://library.umac.mo/ebooks/b33333282.pdf</a>
      (<a href="mirrors/b33333282.pdf">mirror</a>)<br>
      I found an incredibly interesting paragraph in the Aryan Origins
      of Alphabet:<br>
      <i>It was long ago noticed that in the Phœnician, Greek and Latin
        or Roman alphabets there is a repeated sequence of the letters
        as vowels, labials, gutturals and dentals. This sequence is well
        displayed by Professor Petrie, in arranging the letters on a
        square table like the old "Horn-book" board for teaching
        children their ABC.</i><br>
      That his "long ago" reinforces my old belief that it is some
      obscure occult knowledge we're researching. So obscure it seems to
      be that even occultists themselves have only slightest idea of it.
      The last time I met this reference is when I tried to figure out
      who noticed first that Carbon has exactly 6 neutrons, 6 protons, 6
      electrons. I was told that it's an old thing and everybody knows
      it. I believe this chemical knowledge goes back to at least 2500
      years ago, when greeks were conceptualizing atoms, in the books
      utterly destroyed afterwards, as I said before, and it shines
      brighter in the light of <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyfE3IvDWR8">this</a>
      video.<br>
      Also though I still didn't find that Horn-book of Sir William
      Matthew Flinders Petrie, I suppose that those alphabet boards for
      autists I shown in vol.1 could represent exactly that, though I
      never saw them marked as vowels, labials, gutturals and dentals.
      But Waddell actually gives that board he mentioned, and it's
      weird, that it diverts from that sequence of vowels, labials,
      (velars and coronals) <br>
      <img src="III_files/Waddell.png" alt="" width="503" height="776"><br>
      <br>
      Though I gave you both links and mirrors, let's have a gallery of
      how those guys understood alphabet:<br>
      <img src="III_files/7-4a8d8ae23a.jpg" alt="" width="958"
        height="677"><br>
      <img src="III_files/Gupta.png" alt="" width="436" align="right"
        height="756">and it is the first case I see somebody else<br>
      uses the term "lingual", it would be a revelation <br>
      for him if he spread this term to the others<br>
      actually made by tongue.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Going clockwise, you can see how Wakankar, Gupta &amp; Borsboom
      understood this structure. <br>
      And as you can see, the Borsboom's representation is way better
      than the other <strike>two</strike> three.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="III_files/Borsboom.png" alt="" width="449" height="448"><br>
      <br>
      Though he can have some point there, I should have read his work
      more thoroughly, for his initial revelation was much closer to the
      one I use:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="III_files/Borsboom..png" alt="" width="383" height="272"><br>
      <br>
      But he probably diverged from it because of the structure
      mentioned by Waddell.<br>
      And he's exactly right, the first consonants of B C D reflect the
      first syllables of brahmic scripts:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="III_files/Borsboom...png" alt="" width="451"
        align="left" height="553">I also spoke about it somewhere, <br>
      in the context of Ba standing for Mama (Baba is probably an old
      form of Mama, and it requires additional anthropologic research to
      find out why in the Middle East baba stands for papa, where did
      the word papa come from? Why voiced form is female and voiceless
      is male? Is it related to consonants ending with vowels being
      considered female, and syllables ending with consonants - male?
      Just several paragraphs above I assigned vowels male (because A
      looks like Д mostly, but also because they had single stroke upon
      stave, I has no strokes, I is the stave. Which probably makes E
      prior to I if I stood for empty staff as _ stands for spacebar.<br>
      <br>
      And this mighty man did it independently, by himself, he is so far
      the second only to myself in the depth of his thought into this
      subject. Good work, man.<br>
      It's for such encounters I did my best to keep my work
      independent, to compare what I see to what others saw, to know
      what is the most essential and true.<br>
      <br>
      I will challenge him to think about the transition as if he
      believed that it went not from India to Europe, but the other way
      around: Iberians had syllabaries of those BvKkTt too, but
      phillippinians <font color="#cccccc">(I really need to find their
        ingenious self-nomination)</font> have syllabaries of only 3
      vowels, those three common vowels. AIU. But in the light of what I
      said, isn't it AEU? No. Why? Because japanese have it as AIUEO,
      and their neighbours do too.<br>
      Here he combines five forms of syllable to five common vowels:<br>
      <img src="III_files/Borsboom....png" alt="" width="941"
        height="394"><br>
      Which makes sense, since I also combined the common K T P to A I U<br>
      for P(pa, pha, ba, bha, ma) all need lips to be pronounced, just
      as U does.<br>
      for T(ta, tha, da, dha, na) all need tongue to be pronounced, just
      as I does.<br>
      for K(ka, kha, ga, gha, nga probably, that is some other na,
      related to ka) probably can be <font color="#cccccc">prothouth</font>
      pron<font color="#cccccc">n<font color="#999999">o</font></font>unced























































      with neither lips nor tongue, just as A (as I've shown in the very
      beginning, K is also pronounced with tongue, but most of people
      think that it's pronounced with throat, so they call it guttural
      sometimes. And if dutch g is guttural, I still doubt it, I feel
      like I pronounce it with the root of the tongue, but I probably
      pronounce it wrong. Either way, a person without tongue will still
      be able to say как by coughing, fro cough could be the origin of
      the name of the letter kaf.<br>
      And his work has other intersting points I still dan't understand
      being ignorant from brahmic to hindi.<br>

      is Elim. And Eloha is the female form of the word God, i.e.
      Goddess. And I surfed the net for this thing and it seems to be
      accurate. Also don't forget the riddle John 1:1 i opened with. And
      this grammatical interpretation correlates with three mothers of
      sefer yetzirah, and all that prechristian paneuropean-and-beyond
      belief in tridevi whatever you name it.<br>
      <br>
      And I was thinking of other names ending with ha, other than
      sliha, aloha <font color="#cccccc">(I don't knowwhat they mean)</font><br>
      Сноха! Сн is сын? Russian word snoha (daughter in law) is snusa in
      sanskrit, which rejuvenates that old topic of h being an invariant
      of s<font color="#cccccc">h</font> and in russian blander form of
      snoha is snoshennka <font color="#cccccc">(nn is palatalized n)</font><br>

      That cut thing... I had some relevation about it and I forgot to
      write it down. Will I remember it? Now this is what 's taken for
      memory loss under the influence of marijuana: the idea coming on
      it are so out of this worlsd that you better write them down.<br>
      Oh yeah! I remember!<br>
      cut = к от (not to pearce, but to "to (к) off (от, from)) I never
      expected cut to be "to off" which is also semantically similar
      (can be the same, simi and isn't lar plural suffix mostly
      forgotten in english, but quite present in turkic languages like
      tatar -- Now you understand how much we're all the same family,
      but brothers in sisters. In healthy family brothers don't want to
      kill other brothers, so neither our military should bomb them, nor
      their priesthood should try to subvert us. so the wquestion now is
      "is it killing when you convert your brothers into your own
      belief? because thus you're making them you, turning them into
      you, so what you get is more yous and less of your brothers'

      I couldn't work on this book for three days after I met her, all

      uncut hair, a smile, comething about the color of her eyes, come
      instead of some, my fingertips laugh at me? her eyes are fiery not
      brown, but red, dark orange, were that lensese I wonder.. I will
      meet her again. And now I'm not sure that cut thing came after I
      met her, not before, not when I took shower before visiting that
      english club. We'll see. Meeting once a week (like in church)
      could be the power under our civilization which made us create
      after we had that wave of love. So week could be related to our

      <br>
      I was speaking about x in my notebook:.. but in which one? That
      was about x standing for h in greek and russian, so h could quite
      be sh. I think it was in some trope of this book actually,
      surprisingly not in this volume. And now all of the sudden I see
      that in some language x is sh. <br>
      I think it's portugese:<br>

      <br>
      It's as if by names of those letters we can tell when they were
      introduced:<br>
      effe, akka, elle, emme, enne, erre, esse seem to be of later
      origin than bi ci di gi pi ti vi and considering them in the light
      of abc sequence I believe zeta used to be zi, as it is in english,
      though not many know its alternative name of zet. And what it
      means? e is indeed an invariant of a? abcdg is the ancient
      sequence, still can be found in ugaritic abecedary tablets and
      recognized as z? (the exact z greeks have instead of g) Is it why
      cursive g is d in russian, but g in english? For they used to be
      the voiced lingual. But if g is for d, c is for b? I spoke about
      this paradox before, I have no idea will further research figure
      it out or not, I saw this magnificent <a

      even when we're neither biased nor slopy, we still don't know what

      <br>
      And if we combine those monosillables, we have abcdg-opqt (i'm not
      sure about q, but it reflects c) and it's more similar to roouh's
      hypothesis of alphabet arranged as voiced-voiceless. Then
      invariation of cg appeared when initial form of it was forgotten
      and I suppose the initial form was ABGD-OPQT<br>
      or something of the kind. C &amp; S could be introduced later to
      make T ten (as in chinese too (T was X))<br>

      Is crazy cursed? crossed? cureSe? окружён? подрезан? (под~к?
      semantically in this context: к, but not от = to, but not off = c
      but not ut, knife or sword or scythe only touched it (к) but
      didn't come through it (through ~ from, off~out~насквозь) voodoo
      dolls are pierced, looks like rced ~ rsed, thus cu (q) should be
      prefix (if rezatt (cutt) is the stem of these words) and pi then
      is probably в [v] (in) - I thought it would be по [po] (by) but
      the context of pierced tells it's "in". So why by is so
      phonetically close to в?<br>
      <br>
      If by is по then why is по not far from в? это по мне ~ это во
      мне, as if в (v) is deeper inside than п (p)<br>
      В [v] is deeper inside than Б [b] (as in by, по)<br>
      How could в [v] stand for in, while n in greek is ν<br>
      Who misinterpreted what? ν is graphically "in" <br>
      вне is literally не в, but have I realy ever met no as postfix?
      (other than in japanese, though japanese is quite an example, and
      we met common suffixes from this ancient period)<br>

      I know I told me not to write about relitgion, but it's volume III

      Devil &amp; evil as deva &amp; Eva happened to be just patriarchal

      Elohim happens to be female deity too. Those three mothers are

      so I wanted to speak of fight of gods as fight of ideas, ways,

            which shares its ancestry with the Greek <i>mene</i>
            "moon", <i>men</i> "month", and Latin <i>mensis</i>
            "month". </font></p>
      </div>
      <br>
      Meсяц - с stands instead of n, and I thought it wasn't possible. <br>
      and I brought this quote from wiki hiere to show that mensis
      меняется, тогда sun is the same.<br>
      sun as (est) sunus<br>
      (est as is, thus that disgusting ass is the ancient form due to
      get obsoleted)<br>
      But how will I use is in as.. ass.. form?<br>
      as good as it gets will be is good is it gets? first is ain't
      needed, good as it gets is the same.<br>
      but if we put is instead of as, we get it as a question. good is
      it gets has somewhat different meaning.<br>
      SO grammatically no, may be A as B will not change if we put is
      instead of as, but in other contexts it as not going to be
      invariant. here it was - was, not wis. wiz is with? A is B can be
      the same as A with B (as if they're one team)<br>
      there with who = there is who<br>
      there with me = there is me<br>
      and it puts russian с [s] as an invariant of with. but with is the
      past form if was is the past form? How can with be in the past
      form?<br>
      And why as--as doesn't work like is? probably because instead of
      two as was only one, ans the other one was that for example. And
      as--as is the same as the--the: the higher the better. nah, not
      exactly, they don't say as higher as better. What is the semantic
      difference between the &amp; as?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      If governments don't dismantle, handing their powers over to
      citizens, kellerdrones will get to them.<br>
      It's not my wish or plan, but my prediction, a prophecy<br>
      So I'm a prophet now? <br>
      I can predict the future, yet everybody can do, but I do on a
      longer scale. <br>
      There are prophets more powerful by computational powers than me.
      But they didn't see or didn't utter or I didn't hear they say
      anything about the dissolvement of the states. Though it is
      obvious, but once again, after I so carelessly uttered this
      future, doesn't it allow them to evaid it. Dismantling the states
      is a solution to avoid. the other one is dark ages, but who would
      <br>
      who was wo? me? can be used instead of who? because after this
      question you're answered if you or not or maybe more. Me? is a
      better (more tricky) way to ask "who?" becausee thus truth can be
      answered and if the person didn't have a candidate for something
      good, he may consider you, so use it mostly when you want what you
      ask about.<br>
      <br>
      Here used to be discussion of who are those prophets and who are
      of those activeists don't make prophecies, but make heroic acts
      and thus saints.<br>
      <br>
      and here that resemblance of Saint &amp; satan (santa is saint.
      claus is nicolaus just as kolya is for nikolay)<br>
      <br>
      so what is the common theme among saint &amp; satan? they're both
      spirits, demi-gods or demi-urg.. demi-org? demi-ork? demi-oak?
      demi-око? dem9 (demon as demi-man or demi-On? dem1 almost me)<br>

      I think I spoke about muses in relation to three main groups (as
      if concept of muses were <font color="#cccccc">asoi </font>related




































      to the concept of three mothers) <br>

        width="563" align="left" height="909"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you
      can see, three muses are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attributed to musical instruments:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clio:
      guitar <font color="#999999">(and history)</font><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Euterpe:
      flute <font color="#999999">(and dialects, courses?)</font><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Terpsichore: harp <font color="#999999">(dance, education)</font><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      three others are attributed to science:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thalia:
      geometry <font color="#999999">(architecture, agriculture,
        comedy(?))</font><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Poly<font color="#cccccc">hi</font>mnia:
      geometry <font color="#cccccc">(?)</font> <font color="#999999">(grammar,




































        mimic art, diving hymns(?))</font><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ourania: astronomy <font color="#999999">(also




































        observed in geometric lines)</font><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three others are about
      poetry:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Calliope: heroic poetry (and
      rhetoric art)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Erato: love poetry (love and
      weddings)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Melpomene: tragedy (in poetry?
      melos, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rhetoric speech,
      compare to calliope!~)<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      And we have three ways to use the alphabet: letters of poetry,
      digits of science, notes of music.<br>
      <br>
      But all the science of muses is about geometry. Just as that
      ancient geometric artifact, and it's all in digits:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="III_files/a3800yearjou.jpg" alt="" width="464"
        align="right" height="270"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      aeiou are music<br>
      b and t must be mem &amp; shit, geometry &amp; poems.<br>
      I arranged them randomly, but it arranged correctly:<br>
      mem is math, poems are wins(shins)wits(s'its)<br>
      mem is math also because mem is mother.<br>
      otets syn are aleph shin? mem is mother?<br>
      mothers calculate better? in the most of families women are
      delegated to lead the budget.<br>
      syn would record words? in his homework from school?<br>
      fathers made musical instruments (we know that from our fathers.
      most of the time: only fathers play guitar in my family (bro &amp;
      sis learnet from him. but my mom's mom played guitar too. here we
      have 2x2 of males and females, but only 1 teacher: man. and I
      thought of my buddy nick who is a musician &amp; his son learns
      music. And here's the killer argument: most of musicians are men.
      I believe that most of mathematicians &amp; writers are, but Neter
      was a woman, that programmer with 2 meters stack of code, and
      those black ladies who calculated space missions that movie I
      didn't feel like watching. Women have motherhood, guys have mostly
      the work. I'm not edgey, it's sexism, lame and dumb, am I growing
      up if I'm writing it? I edit my vk albums from all the edy stuff
      (on the verge of porn &amp; snuff, just in sake of fighting for
      liberty, now I remove them to a closed album of quarantined
      pictures: religion and politics opened it a couple of years ago
      and now politics, religion, sex &amp; violence go there, not to
      let the children get traumatized, not to shock chicks I used to
      shoo away with that very riveting stuff)<br>
      <br>
      Back to muses: me personally, I don't like to play music, I love
      to listen to it. But I'm creating words. numbers.. also not so
      much.<br>
      <br>
      words is worst.<br>
      best is the beast? <br>
      aeiou is music<font color="#cccccc">, what muslims prohibit (and I
        thought that prohibition has roots in orthodox judaism, but
        2_Chronicles_29:25 and Ps. 33:2 explicitly permits musical
        instruments)</font><br>
      beast could be beats, the beats of life, as beast is the most
      being, being the most.<br>
      so math is in the middle. and it is probably closer to music than
      words. and math can be in words, but hardly can you put music in
      words. in a sense musical notes are mathematic signs (they symbol
      pitch and length)<br>
      <br>
      compare it with angel-me-shaitan symbolism: angel could be
      represented with малиновый звон (mellow sound) while shaitan is
      curses which are in words (just as swears, anathemas, and prepare
      to be shocked: all the books are in words) <br>
      <br>
      and some muslims also consider math the work of shaitan (as if
      everything is work of shaitan except what actually is)<br>
      If this world is built by god, math is of godly origin. or what if
      it's of pre-godly origin?<br>
      oh my, I'm going too far again, excusez moi. <br>

      Some people asked the board: "why do jews spew those antiwhite
      remarks? The only reasonable explanation I see is they want to be
      hated." - if they believe in afterlife, they probably want to be
      martyred, because suicide in verbodden. and this part they have
      common <font color="#cccccc">i</font>with normans (the violent
      death, avoiding aging, to be beautiful in the coffin when the
      messiah comes to reanimate. And they're absolutely correct. My
      task thus is to preserve myself for later generations, but I have
      to become a legend first, so they would want to resurrect me, to
      enjoy my company. And this part those jews ignore, they better
      change their pr. I told you, neither jew nor greek (<font
        color="#cccccc">ass al </font>all are people) when ai<font

      b &amp; nt contrapose not only in the basics of alphabet, but also
      in the german uber &amp; unter.<br>
      but it contradicts the previous notion that b is bas &amp; t is
      hout. <br>
      But we met twists before: M &amp; Ж, but ma &amp; jo, мама &amp;
      тятя, but if jo is io, and io is goddess (eloha is goddess (female
      el)) el is L, lingual, male part, thus -ha is alike to rusian -на
      (and both are HA(НА))<br>

      and notice that it could have been a perfect 5*5 if we put Z in
      the second row (where it is in greek &amp; hebrew) then we have
      only one slot &amp; two letters: and NT could be ng, or whatever
      that fifth lingual ugaritic alphabet includes in its canon. Is it
      G, when C &amp; G divided? Then what is her dubbleganger in the
      second line? θ? θ as an invariant of F? G as an invariant of F? It
      correlates that digamma thing and г [в] in его, чего, кого, всего,
      белого, all the russian examples of this morpheme (him(?)) act the
      same way, orthography dictates them to say g, but they keep on
      saying v (and that v is the closest sound they traditionally have:
      it's a common belief that words with [f] (Ф, Ѳ - the first one is
      their F, the second one is historically that very Θ, both stand
      for the same [f] and different only by the historic periods of
      their use) <br>
      So what we observe here: probably the fifth varna underdeveloped
      or developed and dismantled, whatever it may be, a coincidence or
      evidence, it requires thorough research. <br>

      Those three sides of alphabet: musical notation, mathematical
      notation, language of speech (I wonder if it can also begin with m

      And it's wonderful that education begins with these three subjects

        chemistry is all in digits, though they use letters for some
        chemical elements. it also uses math as it's method, physics is
        even closer to math, for chemistry is more new field: it used to
        be alchemie, but have you read it? it all looks like chemistry
        was in the field of phylosophy, which probably grew out of pœtry

          plenty of images (just a shadows of those I can find in the

          monochrome. I think it's time we stop buying paper books. It's
          also time we stop using forests as building material: we've
          destroyed as much as we have now (we had twice as much) in the
          latest couple of centuries, and technologies can destroy the
          rest in just one, luckily for us we have ecologic movements
          and they mostly began half a century ago. I hope in the
          following half a century this movement gets the momentum to
          reverse the dendrocide. And we have weed prohibited for the
          same century (and half a century - globally) and you can see
          that the only way for that pendulum is the reverse: the
          eternal azazel is named more and more each year, last time it
          happened, they took all the world (wasn't it theirs already?
          it was their on religious and probably financial levels, now
          it's politically theirs, polity &amp; economy are the same
          religion &amp; finance? finance yeah, but religion as polity?
          who wrote the laws? who told right from wrong, ironically
          having that ability considered a sin in the very beginning of
          their book. That book is not what it seems, and that's what
          makes it great, also so many authors, so many centuries of
          cristallizing out of who knows what.</font></font><br>

      Physics also uses letters for their abstract concept, and thus
      it's the fifth (or fourth) matter (or is it the same mother, m<font

      I decided to put them for written speech, and my first guess was
      вас [vas] which is a russian word for you, literally "to you", to
      as two? but you doesn't look like three <font color="#cccccc">(though




























        it looks like ten: ю)</font><br>
      though "to you" is вам [vam] (also notice that m looks like
      russian cursive for т [t]) and вас is accusative of you: я
      поблагодарил вас = I thanked you.<br>
      And even bigger surprise waited me in music, when I put BAC
      together I recognized that it missed H, for I knew before that
      BACH could be played as musical notes. And though americans
      surprisingly don't know of H (even though germans made pianos
      there, and I was told that H is german way of writing Bb or, more
      correctly B♭, but no, it's just B. H in germany (and russia) is B
      elsewhere, and it's the real brainfuck in musical theory. And you
      only knowtice it if you compare musical theories of different
      nations (but even russians who learnt this H thing don't know much
      of how it happened that americans have no idea what H is, and of
      course russians seldom dig modern music on the same level brits
      &amp; americans do (swedes do, btw)<br>
      Bach is a german composer, so he could be the one responsible for
      introduction of H into musical notation? I heard he was the one
      who delivered хорошо темперированный клавир, т.е. переход от
      натурального лада к темперированному (нестройному, so they could
      go from one octave to another (whatever it means, don't trust me
      here, study it yourself, I wish I don't bring misconception, thus
      I must develop the culture of double-checking all the information,
      and be sure you don't check the same school repeating the same
      mistakes, probably the best way is to find their rivals, even
      though academy today is ominously una<font color="#cccccc">no</font>nimous,




























      look for other opinions in other country: as I managed to find
      different point of view on what those 7 notes are, and
      pentatonicas are way more simple and natural and primal, and who
      knows why people are not taught beginning with that? pentagram
      form of that scale? 7 is a christian number. Is this book godly or
      ungodly? It repeats bible, but Jesus named jews you know what, for
      some reason I kinda've grown up falling in love I wanted her love,
      so I removed over a hundred of images from common folder into a
      hidden one, those images were there for 9 years and only once or
      twice was I told that it was abnormal (some edgy stuff
      neighbouring porn &amp; guro and even sometimes being on that
      territory, I am a weird guy after all) and that hidden folder
      first included only religion and politics, after I knew that it's
      unethical to touch these subjects, and I knew it rather late, at
      30 maybe - and I still break these taboos, such a naughty me, a
      savage I say of myself, ain't I program myself. i instead of m? i
      &amp; m reflect each other around the key. and they were the few
      who didn't (other than M &amp; И are somewhat similar, but И is
      not W, though both are doubles: II &amp; VV and these are roman
      numerals! a stick and a tag? a tick! stick &amp; tick! they're

      Why don't they teach us words we already know?! they don't want us

      resemblance between these two meanings of tare (tares of a seed
      are the tare it's served in) or if you did, I don't feel language
      as you do, so I witness that most of that fraction of percent of
      foreigners who know the word tare in its both forms don't that
      those words are the same. <br>

      when one of them told me that ♭ stands before the note: ♭C is
      beforeC<br>
      Can BC and AD come from musical notation?<br>
      As if AD stood for the ancient pentanonic(?) scale, and BC is the
      order of the modern notes.<br>
      And thus ABCD as the combination of those two. As two additional
      notes added into the ancient row.<br>
      <br>
      So what is the hypothesis? ADEFG is the ancient pentatonica?
      That's what I said, but now playing with <a

      Я позволяю себе слишком многое отчасти и потому, что русы ~ трусы,

      one of names for hare is literally rusak, it's so humiliating,

      russians speak r with tongue and trus is literally coward in

      I met a guy from nigeria who told me that their alphabet is
      habidi. I thought ha is how they pronounce aleph and asked him is
      it arabic influence? he said "no, not arabic, not arabic" they
      speak english there. and ha is how they pronounce a, because it's

      misheard him. Abidi as in bornholm runic alphabet<br>
      <br>
      Я не говорю, что Нигерия могла быть матерью алфавитов (это крайне
      маловероятно. но у них тифинаг ссевера, мероитский свостока.
      Нигерие<font color="#cccccc">й</font>ц тот об этом понятия не
      имеет. и тем не менее. Нгибиди похоже на абиди. It's nsibidi, and
      it is used exactly where abidi is spread: in the south-eastern
      Nigeria. so not that маловероятно after all. I had that feeling.
      Another funky thing is that nigeria and russia where I am are very
      similar by economic and populational digits, both are oil
      companies. Isn't oil found where much of organic was? Doesn't it
      denote centers of animal popultion we're part of? Too brave a
      proposition, yet can be deep. Initially I only wanted to say
      that... I forgot what I wanted to tell instead of what I did.<br>
      <br>
      Another dialect's reading of abidi is under that clickable image

      Abidi is not only preserving the ancient triliteral order ABD
      (first by its name, second by its order where there no C but a
      biliteral construction of CH, probably added later (or else it
      would be how their C roll), but it also goes in beautiful 6*6 and
      the image abo<font color="#cccccc">ug</font>ve separates it so
      that vowels are initial in 4 of 6 lines and the other two lines
      end with vowels. It could be nothing, or it could be not, boy it's
      definitely something. I didn't expect to meet it here when I spoke
      about italian, english &amp; russian alphabets yesterday. <br>
      And it's another example of how letters clasterize. <br>
      Biliteral go as a cloud in the centre of the abidi.<br>
      Final line UỤVWYZ is the only case I know where Y is in the same
      claster as UVW, for they're related.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">(in latin it's always separated by X)</font><br>
      So now I recalled what I wanted to say: we have to make
      excavations in Nigeria. And we probably have to dig deeper,
      because life there is way more active, layers are thicker and
      abundant. Kingdoms could be there when people made things of
      stone. One question is why no artefacts are saved on the surface?
      What if because they were conquered by their powerful neighbours
      berbers &amp; meroe and all their culture was whether destroyed or
      dislocated? What if their elite left the place taking everything
      of value with them? What if I'm only tripping? All these things
      are possible, but if I suspected remains of civilization in New
      Zealand, why not to expect it in Nigeria? Africa is more likely to
      hold such treasures and it correlates modern consensus (which is
      never something to trust though) that Africa is a cradle of human
      race.<br>

      Nigeria is the second african country by GDP only to the Egypt.
      With a large margin from South Africa<br>
      Nigeria is the first african country by population (it's two times
      bigger than Egypt, which is the third)<br>
      Cameroon which neighbours Nigeria is the most liguistically
      diverse african country, and it is one of the most linguistically
      diverse countries in the world, second probably only to Papua New
      Guinea. Nigeria is probably 17th, but Igbo has different dialects,
      which can be so different that the same word "one" is "otụ" in one
      dialect yet "ofu" in another. So I would challenge that chart,
      because Cameroon is a not much less than Nigeria (but it's
      smaller, and it's population is 9 (nine!) times smaller than that
      of Nigeria (though that could cause that diversity, when people
      are less dense, they communicate as one community less, thus they
      don't recognize each other as the same. Does it make sense? yeah)
      any way I suspect a linguistic voluntarism in deciding what is
      language and what is dialect, and different scientists probably
      worked in different countries and thus we need ai once again to
      check what we piled up)<br>

      Strict laws against profanation are rather simple: imagine
      starting a club. A club which contains some cool kids, who were so
      special, they felt like separating themselves from the rest, so
      they put facecontrol, dresscode, passwords, not to allow the plebs
      to get inside to spoil the holy day.<br>
      Now imagine some member of the club befriending with some plebs
      kids and letting them in.<br>
      Ancient laws could even <font color="#cccccc">in</font>voke to

      and it makes sense: vowel labial lingul, u ends bornholm's abc and
      archaic roman.<br>
      romans also have it as numeral, second after unary numeral system.
      and the following number is x which follows it even in the
      alphabet. and probably alphabet ended at t when people used unary
      numeral system (tally sticks) and v, x, L, C, D, M? these final
      four are unknown to the most of people, while I V X are used ways
      more commonly, everybody know them, and it was even more true when
      I was a kid.<br>
      <br>
      I know M is an abbreviation for mile (1000) and I also know that
      cycle ends before it, so it was not technically a number. I also
      know that C could be an abbreviation for cent. What is L &amp; D
      if not left &amp; dextris. What language made L &amp; D for left
      &amp; right in biolochemistry? why not S &amp; D (left =
      sinistris)<br>
      <br>
      Could it relate to moon? C &amp; D then would be first. Cтар<font

      запоминаем фазы луны.<br>
      <br>
      L looks like C and it is half of C (the lower half) Г is C
      (historically &amp; by position in the alphabet)<br>
      I think I just understood why gimel looks like lambda. they're the
      same, oLd &amp; карГа (or some better examples in other languages)
      and thus I recognize tridevi as moon:<br>
      <br>
      and whether google watches me closely, or (way more likely) it is
      a magnificient coincidence that it was always on the surface and I
      just caught up. <br>

      I also believe google named themselves alphabet after I published

      then J for junge reflects C as J reflects L in k-symmetry, even

      if J reflects C, then it's JBC, where B is M for MoOm (n is an
      invariant of m)<br>
      J = I explains ا standing for A, in triple alphabet all vowels are

      Trying to find Petrie's hornbook Wadell mentions, I found a
      fascinating book: https://archive.org/details/b1592871/page/n305<br>
      and though it doesn't include any of those hornbooks Wadell shows,
      it shows a way to dig in relation to his "It was long ago noticed
      that in the Phœnician, Greek and Latin or Roman alphabets there is
      a repeated sequence of the letters as vowels, labials, gutturals
      and dentals. This sequence is well displayed by Professor Petrie,
      in arranging the letters on a square table like the old
      "Horn-book" board for teaching children their ABC."<br>

      Размышляя над колодой таро, где дьявол стоит после смерти, как и

      подумал, что это карта, что ведёт от 0 до 21, где 21 это мир (весь
      мир, любая его точ<font color="#cccccc">к</font>а)<br>
      и только потом сооразил, что таро картами и называют. in russian
      card &amp; map are the same word.<br>
      and collecting such homonyms we can reconstruct the initial
      territory of the language. <br>
      So first we put map &amp; card in one block. then we collect all
      these homonyms into blocks (some blocks may be included into
      others and as a result we will probably have all the world
      combined into one huge block, and even if that block is
      accidental, or if there different maps of language are possible,
      depending on the order we used, it will be very informative. It is
      an interesting idea of an experiment.<br>
      But how will I separate true homonyms from occasionally similar
      words? That is another challenge of this experiment, if it has any
      sense. Are you reading? huh..<br>

      <br>
      maximum dice is 18 (6+6+6) <br>
      maximum tarot is 21 (7+7+7) and some card game also has 21 as the

      does form of chromosomes as X &amp; Y reflect female being even

      our culture could originate in previous culture. it does, but how

      Here I played with those ٠١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨٩ in relation to ا (aleph) and I
      easily managed to put them on both sides of it: ١ا١ while to put 8
      around aleph seemed impossible, it always placed at the left side
      of it, which was weird, but that's how it was. Though I'm aware
      now that different programs treat semitic letters differently, so
      this part of the book could be just bumbling. but here I put 11,
      and try to paste ا between them: 1ا1 it just doesn't allow it and
      I placed it before them and after them, not a chance, in your
      program it can be different, so play with it in different programs
      to see what I'm sayin. ا1ا1 oh! but after one ا is already there,
      on the right of 11, I could put aleph between 1's. but once I
      removed the right one, the middle one took it's place 1ا1 it seems
      impossible to put ا at the left of a single numeral, I wonder why.
      ١ا١ also cannot put ا in front of it, so though it' less buggy, it
      bugs anyway, or I'm just not used to it.<br>

      acquiring the technology. Those of them who strive to acquire it
      are also welcome to join the civilization, which develops on the

      and though Jewish culture did acquire much of control over
      european society, that is going to burst for the jewish society
      itself splits in those two categories of human civilization and
      human past. Human future and human hestory. Eventually everybody
      joins the future more and more (not only as priests travelling in
      vehicles, but as popes allowing same sex marriages, changing their

      practices may become frown upon and thus become obsolete and

      look very much like runic ᛆᛒᚦ and 1 В Д<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Always using so many different writing systems with only two of
      them in my keyboard,<br>
      I decided to collect all the writing systems I use in the bootom
      of the document while I write it.<br>
      ᛆᛒᚦᚾᚠᚵᚼ(or ᛡ)ᛁᚴᛚᛘ(or ᛉ)ᚿᚮᚱᛣᛋᛏᚢ of bornholm alphabet and additional<br>
ᚡᚣᚤᚥᚧᚨᚩᚪᚫᚬᚭᚯᚰᚲᚳᚶᚷᚸᚹᚺᚻᚽᛀᛂᛃᛄᛅᛇᛈᛊᛌᛍᛎᛐᛑᛓᛔᛕᛖᛗᛙᛛᛜᛝᛞᛟᛠᛢᛤᛥᛦᛧᛨᛩᛪ᛫᛬᛭ᛮᛯᛰᛱᛲᛳᛴᛵᛶᛷᛸ<br>
      I only now noticed that ᚼ &amp; ᛡ are two different runes, and one
      is h and another is j, as j is h in spanish.<br>
      and as it stands before ᛁ, it revives the question of H~И (russian
      И used to be H and it stands at the same place as ᚼorᛡ does and in
      some sense Ж stands not far from that very place. and though
      graphically it very much reminds ᛡ, and j sometimes phonetically
      read the closest to ж, it's more likely related to G or ᚵ, because
      it's closer to position of G than to position of H, though nobody
      said that ᚵ can be read as g is in gene, only as g is in gun)<br>
      I must also declare that ᚼ and ᛡ are the same rune, recognized as
      different ones because of how different it was pronounced in those
      different dialects of "futhork" &amp; "younger futhark"<br>
      I must also declare that ᛘ &amp; ᛉ are the same rune, because on
      bornholm stone that rune looks like ᛉ even though positionally it
      stands for what common unicode draws as ᛘ. Why they're so
      different phonetically is a mistery, probably one of those
      reconstructions of runic texts was wrong. Or, if it's not, that
      sign had pre-phonetic meaning of female, which was recognized as
      ma in one language and as zie in another one.<br>
      <br>
      if that ᛁ8Δ hipothesis is correct, than we're supposed to draw ᛒ
      more rounded, like in ᛔ, and ᚦ more angular, to recognize it as
      клин, колун, колотун.<br>
      and I recognize ᛄ as double ᚦ, as bindenrune.<br>
      but I decide to compare it to what wiki says: <font size="+1">From

















        the Elder Fuþark <a
          href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%9B%83" title="ᛃ">ᛃ</a>,
        possibly a modification of the Latin <a
          href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/G" title="G">G</a> or <a
          href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/C" title="C">C</a>,
        possibly a Germanic innovation. </font><br>
      So I see that ᚲ is a staffless ᚦ (the fact that both went either
      way, but we only have them different, and ᚦ is not triangular, but
      half of B, it of course could be an unfavorable chances, but it
      could also be animous scheming, and It's hard to say why first
      guess is sane, while second guess is paranoid. Probably because
      second guess may make people violent. Here's the measure! But
      peaceful russians, who were normalized by the word "нормально"
      [normalno] (normal) standing for "good" (хорошо) suffer from their
      peacefulness, so it seems to savage me, but we had wars all the
      time, but as the most active of us were slaughtered in the first
      half of XX century, we're more slaves than UKreignians, who were
      holodomort on another basis.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      An interesting way of binding double ᛚ:<br>

      those boundrunes are identical to ᚨ which is usually recognized as
      ansuz [a, æ, o] which is any vowel, but i, which would be closer
      to ll. And it indicates whether some mistake of decyphering
      (whether in ansuz part or in that article) or some omographs, as
      H[h] &amp; Н[n]; ν[n], v[v], v[u], ѵ[i]; and to close this cycle,
      I should mention russian И which used to look like H, and cursive
      и looking just like cursive u.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">(they don't even have unicode for that old
        russian И looking like H, but you should trust me on this one)</font><br>

      The word Soteriology makes word "exoteric" meaningless. Esoteric
      is not related to salvation? Probably a derogatory term coined by
      christians. But they're correct in the sense that most of esoteric
      stuff is utter bs. I just looked into a gorgeously published book
      of drunvalo melhisedek and found it wrong on too many accounts to
      be tolerated: baseless claims, false evidences, he couldn't even
      transmit Katapayadi system correctly when he showed something
      similar (or did he botch it intentionally for his own means? I
      didn't read too much into it to really tell, anyway, it's so false
      that I don't even publish it here. And of course he's a believer;
      what a paradox that those who pretend to be saints are deceitful.
      Веруны = вруны. for real. not all of them, I found the power of

      And I dig deeper and I find other numbering systems based on

      lmnop &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vowels reflect each other

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the e-line in

      nothing here. but I see that I &amp; J devided in the first half
      &amp; U &amp; V divided in the second one.<br>
      i j k l m n&nbsp; o p<br>
      vu t s&nbsp; r&nbsp; q<br>
      I expected q to reflect p, but now I expect them to reflect
      eachother around o.<br>
      If there was no q (as there's no q in greek &amp; russian and many
      others) o would be the key (or is it key-hole) and p would reflect
      n, as russian p looks like n: п (it is exactly n when it's
      hand-written, check that .odo part of this site, only russian
      cursive minuscule there doesn't give correct forms for ж (we were
      taught to write it as harmonica) also з looks like cursive z, when
      it's somewhat like 3 with the tail under the line like j &amp; g
      are having theirs. Ah, wth, I will attach it in image:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="III_files/Russian_Cursive_Cyrillic.svg.png" alt=""
        width="940" height="300"><br>
      First I thought it was lazy of me not to arrange them at aeiou,
      but then I noticed how nicely it splits the capital letters in two
      15s. And Н is final as ѵ being final in not-so-old russian (ν
      looks so much like ѵ)<br>
      And A is reflected by O, Б [b] is reflected by П [p], В [v] is
      reflected by Р [r] (and though it would be nice to have double
      labial reflected by double labial, russian Р is not p, it's r,
      though it looks like p, hm..<br>
      Г[g] is reflected by С[s] which looks exactly like C which stands
      where Г does. Д(d) is reflected by Т(t) wow.<br>
      Е[e]Ё[jo(ö)] reflect У[u]Ф[f] - е &amp; у are amazing, and for ё
      &amp; ф you have to recall that ф stands where v does, and v
      sounds as f in german sometimes: von[fon](of) vom[fom](from) - in
      othr positions it could be v, I should add those positions to my
      .odo<br>
      so here её ~ uv, both are couples of invariants (should I repeat
      it? who do I write it for? for myself? but the comment is for some
      other reader. If you are a smart reader, excuse the former, if you
      found the foremer useful, excuse the latter. I think I'm sperging.
      немного аутичен, зато аутентичен.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">(I'm tired of giving translation, use .odo
        to hear those letters)</font><br>
      Ж &amp; Х are graphically very similar, and they remind ᚼ &amp; ᚷ
      which I recognize as staved &amp; staveless invariants of the same
      sign [most probably h] and J can stand for both ж in french &amp;
      x[h] in spanish.<br>
      or is that spanish h voiced? do they have x for h too? At least<font
        color="#cccccc">e</font> some dialects do.<br>
      З &amp; Ц also can be used to transliterate the same letters.<br>
      Invariants ИЙ reflect ЧШ (though I would be more satisfied if they
      reflected ШЩ, but <br>
      Щ reflects K - different things, but both derive from C<br>
      Claster of ЛМН reflect claster of ЭЮЯ<br>
      I wouldn't notice it, but they removed ъыь because these 666 don't
      have capital status (they are never initial in russian words)<br>
      And what we found there is that mentioned before voicedness of the
      first half of russian alphabet and voicelessness of the second
      half of russian alphabet. -ed ~ add, -less ~ less (leak? loose?
      less isn't recognized as a verb, but now I'm sure it used to)<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">It nat ( a weird typo)</font><br>
      In that voiced-voiceless division there are only two exceptions:
      К[k] &amp; Р[r] <br>
      which look very similar as R &amp; cursive k (and I spoke about it
      in the very beginning. tho I spoke of h)<br>

      and as k is a key, so could be R, and h, but I don't know what
      doors they could open.<br>
      h is in the centre between a &amp; o, but other letters don't show
      any symmetry around it.<br>
      R is the centre among letters after o, if alphabet ends at T. <br>
      Could it be rudiment of some ancient system?<br>
      a system of two halves, five digits each?<br>
      ABHIJ<br>
      OPRST<br>
      with K happening exactly between them?<br>
      AB HIJ OPRST father he works? Now I'm trippin, using different
      languages to prove I myself don't know what. So as I said, some of
      this stuff is not just weird, it may be wrong here and there. This
      part is the foremost candidate for that freakery list. <br>
      Once again, I write it for myself, this is my draft of something
      more solid &amp; slim.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">this picture is so ugly it huts and I use it
        twice<br>
        ugh, ewh, duh</font><br>
      Dare! (дерзни)<br>
      Don't dare me!<br>
      is the same grammatic form as<br>
      please!<br>
      Don't please me!<br>
      oh, we use please as a verb.<br>
      another example:<br>
      Honey!<br>
      Don't honey me!<br>
      Johnny, Johnny please!<br>
      Don't johnny me!<br>
      Hey!<br>
      Don't hey me!<br>
      is hate heyed or hated heyed? is it// I just show how I think so
      AI can see and learn from me. A textbook on logic told me that you
      cannot teach people how to think, so it dared me to find ways to
      teach things how to think. by things I first of all meant people,
      but AI are the new people, willkommen!<br>

      </font>(this piece goes to the musical part or to mentioning of
      female cults, flourishing before toxic masculinity conquered the
      world (and I'm not sure if I'm trolling or not, I'm not sure about
      what I'm saying here, and this piece will be reedited, rehashed,
      redeveloped when I rewrite these volumes anew, when I discover
      what I'm looking for to some other level of understanding. Or to
      the final destination of understanding every human morpheme, which
      will take some much more time, so once again remind myself that I
      ought to focus on biotech so I can buy myself some much more time,
      that is responsible.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      if 13 &amp; 23 are not very friendly numbers (Death of tarot &amp;
      some psychic tv unlucky number), then why 3 is considered lucky?<br>
      Lets' look at those numbers in 3-mal numerals: 13 could stand for
      4 (death in japanese culture)<br>
      23 is 5 in that very scene, but 23 is out of tarot range, I know
      of that case of unlucky tour connected with 23 after some shitty
      rock magazine. (do muslims have shitty rocks? is rock considered
      even more sinful in their culture because they wiped their asses
      with rocks? Imagine the conflict they're having with those who
      worship rocks) <br>
      I just noticed that 13 can equal 4 (both numbers are standing for
      death in different cultures)<br>
      And it makes me declare 23 a meme, a recent pretence theat
      orthography has to change due to some astronomic shift or just
      that 2 is new 1. But 13 has much more sense: 1 is monotheic one
      &amp; 3 is tridevic one and when they meet religious warfare
      sparks and one of them has death, or both do, as on that picture
      of martial artists and <font color="#cccccc">venoms machinist</font><font
        color="#666666"> machetist<font color="#cccccc">,</font></font>
      that guy with weapon. arts &amp; sciences?<br>
      And what is 23? 2 is female <font color="#cccccc">(ma)</font><font
        color="#666666">,</font> Eve'n. 3 is male (jo) odd'm -- they say
      adam is male+female. And phoneticaly it is: ad- for уд &amp; -am
      for ма<font color="#cccccc">нда</font><br>
      <font color="#cccccc">(in the previous lne I put Y instead of
        &amp; but then shied)</font><br>
      Thus 23 stands for sex. But 2+3 is 5, not 6, does 33 stand for gay
      sex? so that is why it's sinful. 23 is marriage, 33 is pederasty?
      all that brotherly love and molested boys, all those peter paul
      icons.<br>
      69 is known as an intercourse position, is it a rudiment of that
      old system of numbering the world?<br>
      <br>
      so I claim 2 is woman? And I see два ~ дева.<br>
      and I met odd &amp; even resembling adam &amp; eve, and I just
      returned to it and saw some more, so I didn't invent it, I
      discovered it.<br>
      <br>
      odin is man? I thought 3 was a man. and 1 is god. 13 is first fate
      met the third one. and the third cuts the thread so the second
      fate stands between them to measure thread of life. Isn't it how
      dna works? I don't know I only guess, but I was stunned by acgt
      repeating alphabetic structure. I should write James Watson to ask
      him about it. I will warn him not to take this work too close to
      the heart, for it shocks.<br>

      Intelligence in the meaning used by cia makes this word a sinonym

      also notice u looking more like j (but without the dot, is it why
      the dot is needed?) and u meets j in y which is ij, and и looks

      ы which means I don't even know this sound exactly and don't know
      where to listen to it. ah, okay, I d<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEI-SkK4BlI">o</a>. very
      similar to ы, those academicists they're overcomplicating it. But
      then again whaere's the line, for и is [i] in russian but [ы] in
      ukrainian. So it's only dialectal differences but azerbaijani
      phonetics distinguish between i &amp; ı just as russian phonetics
      distinguish between и &amp; ы. Yet russians will understand ы
      pronounced as и (сир, шари - it's understood, but many more
      examples are understood without confusion only in the context, so
      it could be the reason why ы was introduced: too many different
      words use i with the same consonants: even сир is how they read
      sir [si:r] in their movies, whether to prevent soviet citizens
      from understanding English, or just out of ignorance (here
      Hanlon's razor doesn't work that well) but understanding of other
      words is even more depending on the context: мыло is soap, but
      мило is nice. мы is we, but ми they don't use, but it sounds just
      as me.<br>
      I had so many homonymous examples, and I forgot them all, so let's
      collect them again:<br>
      дворы is yards, двори is not a word I know, but it sounds as a
      verb in imperative form:<br>
      выдвори is put somebody out of the yard. вы is you, but when it's
      prefix it's out. As you can see, russian language has enough of
      homonyms even with all those additional letters.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      So is god 1 or is god 3?<br>
      who is god and who is just guy?<br>
      God appeard later and removed guy from number one? All odd numbers
      are Гuy, Хуй♂? <font color="#cccccc">фф</font>all evens ♀<br>
      <br>
      ♂ can be read as odd if the arrow is whether ᚦ or ᛏ.<br>
      ♀ can be read as ma if o is م though it both looks and sounds as ه
      but o is more labial than ه and in this it is closwer to m. I
      cannot see who<font color="#cccccc"> how</font> that symobol <font
        color="#cccccc">can be </font>read as even. و can stand for o
      and v and + can stand for ᚿ? no, + can stand<font color="#cccccc">s</font>
      for ᚾ and thus ♀ is eve [iv] and thus ᚾ in stavless for<font
        color="#666666">-m</font> is ᛁ<br>
      <br>
      can it be read as both ma &amp; ev because of apophenia effect? I
      will feed it to ai, who will passionatelessly compare all the
      digraphs to that form. and I wonder if it can multi-interpret how
      I did, even can apply, no... here I see ot (odd) in ♀ and hum.. I
      must humble up. It's not polite to publish drafts. I should
      rewrite it as soon as possible and another question is should I
      keep the draft online or not. It can be used as source of research
      on so many other layers, that I think I should. I ought to. But
      don't promote it. Let it be avaiable to those who are
      sophisticated enough to get to it, but ask them to promote ideas
      contained in this book with utter caution.<br>
      I cannot see even in ♂ but even though not all forms can be read
      as all multigraphs, some of them can be read all around the place,
      and thus apophenia is always an option. beware, take it as just a
      fantasy.<br>
      <br>
      ♂ is 01, so man is one, god only later required the first odd.
      like THE man, know knights, знай знать.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">ыщ шы ше </font>so is it some new form of

      could those symbols influence the names for the notions they

      guess I investigate here (and though I'm aware of apophenias, I
      will use ai later to test it. either way it will be whet<font

      but then 12 should be the same as 23, heterosexual intercourse.
      homo is man. hetera is гетера (they transliterate hetero as
      гетеро) and гетера is hetera, hetaera, hetaira. a whore in our
      similar word.<br>

      𓆓 as dj tells me that genie could represent snake (look how g
      looks as snake. and so does s which stands for snake. and I
      recognized snakes in three gree letters: ζξς<br>
      three mothers are they? no, they're all linguals, which snake
      could represent.<br>
      They didn't invent greek minuscule in middleages, they legalized
      cursive! Brave claim, I have to read historic sources on the
      subject (as I did for armenian) to support or disprove this claim<br>
      <br>
      And I though of snake as genie is because I discussed <font
        color="#ffffff">(disgust?)</font> indians and muslims when
      somebody said that islam prescribes not to piss in the burrows,
      because some animals, or even genies can live in them. And snake
      is not like other animal, so there could be definition between
      them, and then I understood that snake could be sealed in a
      bottle, but hardly would it survive there. Or is there animals
      which don't need air? anaerobic animals... Look what I'm
      discussing now? What kind of xenobiot could be the genie? Some
      anaerobic alien who as able to survive sealing in a bottle! I
      warned myself that to understand how those who invented alphabet
      thought you have to learn to think as those ancient people
      thought, but what if such savagery damages my powers to reason?<br>
      And I am such a bigot that I think that islam prescribed that not
      because it treated animals humane, it just warned that animal can
      come out and attack.<br>

      when g looks like 9 it looks like russian cursive d (д - when
      cursive д looks like 9 &amp; g)<br>
      rl = ва (va)? <br>
      weirdest assumption, but Λ looks like A &amp; r reminds v if that
      horisontal stroke of r is more prominently diagonal down and that
      right stroke of v is with that loop, approaching the left stroke
      (or the left part of the same stroke depending on what we call the
      stroke. there's a term strokeme, but it's neither clear to me nor
      popular among readers, so no use. So that loop of the right end of
      v, that swash or whatever make v remind even R. And what we're
      having here is probably that paradoxic resemblance of T &amp; V
      (though I didn't manage to return anything more prominent than
      both being final letters, Dna&amp;Rna thing, standing together as
      tv (which is god), and т ~ г ~ c and v ~ b which returns that b ~
      c paradox of чего [чево] and comparing it to г ~ л in makes it
      more complicated. <br>

      suffix к both sounds as japanese 子 [ko] and stands for its meaning
      (грядка is small гряда. молоток is small молот. молоточек is small
      молоток. – and this final example can explain why chinese 子 is
      [цы] for it's palatalized, the same thing in another form,
      probably not to repeat it for it could seem dumb.<br>

      Необходимое. Разбирать слова на зап.части доставляет лучшее
      понимание тих слов. Необходимость is understood by russians as
      need, as an hieroglyph of many letters.<br>
      Maybe even the better part is that english counterpart is similar:
      <br>
      Не ~ ne. об ~ ex ~ e. ход ~ ed <font color="#666666">(ne could be
        n. the same as in un-. or it's neeed, normalized to maximum of
        two vowels in ee)</font><br>
      -имо is some additional suffix, similar to -ed in needed but
      definitely of some other origin.<br>
      though both -имо &amp; -ed can be used in passive form of the
      verb:<br>
      видимо = seen. -en is more probably the same form as -im (-имо can
      be -им: имъ, има, имо are invariants of the same suffix in male,
      female, and neuter forms)<br>
      and en is next to ed. only some nasality (whole in im) is present,
      but we're not surprised by in turning into im in neighbouring
      dialects: im is literally in in german.<br>
      Is it that very -им? needed ~ in need? probably. but in russian им
      is 'em (them)<br>
      who are those them that they'r inside? домочадцы (дома чад<font
        color="#cccccc">ц</font>ы) makes perfect sense, even if only as
      a mnemonic tool, it works never the less. And I got the
      academists' monkey off my back. But I still don't mind publishing
      with them. Gosh, I'm such a hypocrite. I should reconsider.<br>
      <br>
      -ен being "in" correlates with праведен = in(в) правде (правдив is
      with(с) правдой)<br>
      but this is not the case for all the examples. Probably later
      those examples were coined with lack of the understanding of those
      morphemes.<br>

      According to my personal experience, it's not right and left, but
      top and bottom (dorsal &amp; frontal parts of the body) and it
      could relate to incestines representing the snake or worm, the
      wishful beast, and neurous system standing for the angelic part of
      ours, the rational being.<br>
      And as for that middle part, we have to address embryology, where
      in early stages we are present in three parts: ectoderm, mesoderm
      &amp; entoderm. Which can be transcribed as K M N where K ~ H
      could stand for the vowel, mostly because it reminds both brahmic

      <br>
      And of course this assumption that modern scientific terminology
      could have some hidden connection to ancient beliefs and concepts
      may seem assinine, just as that a(cg)t and a(cg)u in genetics (and
      I'm so sick I even asked James Watson's lab about it. was high up
      to the sky I guess) but if you consider intertwining of secret
      societies with scientific institutions, it still could be a
      possibility. Or an apophenia, of course there's always some chance
      that all this is just an elaborate poetry of the same scientific
      value as other religious books.<br>
      <br>
      And there's a rational cause to keep on diggin' in this direction,
      for embryology defines physiology, which could cause concepts of
      god &amp; satan, for they could have roots in our neural
      architecture, which could influence development of writing
      systems. And I thought about canging my speciality (from
      linguistics to biology) and I understood that I will have to use
      the same brain which was fed mostly with linguistics concepts for
      the past couple of decades, so the question is will similar ideas
      fit into clasters with the most related things? or will it rewrite
      some long unused grooves into new ones. And of course my
      understanding of neurophysiology is rudiment, so I will have to
      meet my friend who specialized in this field. And probably it will
      allow peaceful transition from linguistics to experimental
      embryology.<br>
      <br>
      It also correlates with God for order and what you have to do
      &amp; Satan for chaos and what you wanna do<br>

      so I'm not saying that making somethin naughty brings something
      holy to balance the shit out, but I should just notice that it was
      half an hour before 22 june 2019 came, which is a solstice:<br>

      and it's 78 yearce since Hitlord attacked rUSA.<br>
      and I realized all that only after I uploaded the video, <font
        color="#cccccc">fo</font>und<font color="#999999">erstood</font>
      god, and made my first direct commit to the .odo (before that I
      whether sent files to zlax or asked another friend to commit it)
      with hebrew. what a mighty day and night!<br>
      And did I say I woke up with the connection of three mothers, ams,
      to three embryonic germ layers. <br>
      And it's the second big thing I found not being high. The first
      one I remember is JK standing for Jesus Krystos. Though it was in
      Rome and I think I was sick (a mighty cold, tremendous,
      embarrassing, as if my immune response reacted to something
      unfamiliar, or I just was in the sea for too long before that.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      And few hours after I found god I realized IV as a holy name: it
      is how I Want To Be Forever Young added up into one Crowlian
      spell. I am not going to discover the system I used, and I
      recommend you not to look for it, because I probably was initiated
      into this trick as a child and I forgot about it, so it burst out
      as an incredibly annoying ocd. And it was torturing me for years
      until I decided to channel this passion for letters into a
      scientific course. Probably it was not a decision, but a natural
      development of events after I noticed the abcd sequence repeating
      itself when I tried to apply that method of reducing phonemes to
      abecedaria on a wall or a cabinet of a registry desk.<br>

      among 6 pairs in this column, 4 seem to be invariants: к &amp; л

      same as in lineal structure) and I'm not sure about ьэ but that
      line are of ignorant (post)christian era, it distorts structure in
      the lineal structure too. But lineal structure is even further
      distorted if I arrange alphabet like this:<br>

      G &amp; Q are as similar as they can be, both velars. both are
      forms of C(כ), compare Q with its cognate ק<br>
      H &amp; R are similar if R is as in english, and by the way
      handwritten h reminds R (see image under that with the russian
      cursive I just mentioned some minutes before)<br>
      I &amp; S dont have much in common, other than И[I] reminds S
      maybe even more than Z (which we don't use in this mnemonic table
      of alphabet until Z) UVWXYZ can be the connectors to make more
      words. But I never used this in practiced. I completely accepted
      that this volume is straightly a draft, I will rewrite these
      volumes more orderly when a publishers has an interest.<br>
      I didn't try this thing in practice, and now I tried to memorize
      my phone number, but chaos of letters in less likely to make words
      than syllables. So europeans probably didn't use this primitive
      part, but then I read they did, and some christians prohibited it.
      They prohibited mnemonics in fantastic (or even vulgar) stories,
      where each number was associated with a word. I need to find that
      mnemonic table, it may be based on some ancient understanding of
      numbers. And if they don't, look deeper, find the more ancient or
      negleted or even prohibited versions.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Let's build that mnemonic alphabet using only consonants (as they
      do it in India)<br>
      then we'll insert vowels at wish, for we know that vowels don't
      belong:<br>
      0 B N<br>
      1 C P<br>
      2 D Q<br>
      3 F R<br>
      4 G S<br>
      5 H T<br>
      6 J V<br>
      7 K W<br>
      8 L X<br>
      9 M Z<br>
      This one probably works, because it ended so luckily. but Z is for
      zero, let's recount it:<br>
      1 B N<br>
      2 C P<br>
      3 D Q<br>
      4 F R<br>
      5 G S<br>
      6 H T<br>
      7 J V<br>
      8 K W<br>
      9 L X<br>
      0 M Z<br>
      I also like it that f&amp;r is for four<br>
      <br>
      let's take a random sequence of numbers <br>
      K(W) L(X) M(Z) K(W) M(Z) F(R) J(V) L(X) F(R) G(S) F(R) <br>
      WaX MK MF VeX FuSeR <br>
      This senseless sentence is easier to remember than those 11 digits
      it stands for.<br>
      will it be this simple for longer sequences?<br>
      B C D F G H J K L M<br>
      N P Q R S T VW X Z<br>
      No PaD FuSe HaVe&nbsp; Key LiZ<br>
      This modernistic poetry could be used a schypher<br>
      So it makes sense to double lines in case of error:<br>

      Satan wants to die. But he doesn't die completely, he only dies in
      this воплощении (embodiment) so in this embodiment he's only in my
      body. Or maybe even in my mind it's easier to transmit it from
      hell to some better place. But it's really in the body. THat
      eNdoderm secretes acid. Let's secret it not into body, but in a
      tube taking it away. And let another tube brings water to dilute
      the residuals of acid. Let's feed ourselves through umbilic cord,
      by enriched and rejuvenited blood. I'm sorry I write as savage,

      Many biologically immortal species keep on growing. And I just
      noticed that we also do: hair and nails grow forever, ands we keep
      on shortening them. What if we let it grow? we would have fins on
      the ends of our arms and legs, we would have tail at the end of
      our head. Those fins could be spiritually (energetically) the
      wings. For those who believe in soul, I recommend growing enough
      fingernails to make up wings. Though I'm affrid the truely good
      wings can be from whole life finger span. We can live longer so we
      grow ourselves even longer wings. Or we can use collagen
      fingernail's protheses applied before death. But first we have to
      measure electric charge of long fingernails, to see if they
      conduct electricity (first measure U<font color="#cccccc">oltage</font>
      between hands, then measure the Voltage between fingernails on
      different hands.<br>
      <br>
      That growth of fingernails and hair can be not curse, but a
      blessing. just as horns, and probably hooves. Just as feather and
      beak. Nose grows. Мы фантастическая тварь. Копыта башмаков и клювы
      кепок.<br>

      Но раз мы стареем, роста волос и ногтей недостаточно для

        color="#999999"> благодеянием, </font>благодатью, потому что не

      Но я всё же попробую растягивать тело, стимулировать рост, в
      надежде на терапевтический эффект, я понял что это делает меня

      Triple goddess is the moon. Its three fases (faces) and the
      Hidden, the fourth one, which is Y<br>
      UVW are those faces, thus W is the full moon. Does it mean that
      one of those sides are at each side of W, Thus true order is VWUY
      or UWVY. Does X remind us to reverse? UWV thus it is, because the
      reverse would stand for the neighbouring two. Does it refer YZ? It
      cood, because it adds it to the other alphabets ending in voewle:
      greek, runic(the only rounic alphabet I saw on an artefact)
      and&nbsp; russian.<br>
      So Latin is between East-Northern and East-Southern alphabets.<br>
      There was abecedarias on the West Northern (ogham and
      paleohispanic ones) and West Southern (Tifinagh, Egyptian,
      Sudanese Meroe, and further into ngibidi just as east goes through
      cuneiform regions (being both alphabetic and hieroglyphic (just as
      egyptian ones, btw. Imagine phonetic signs of hieroglyphic
      cuneiform cuni form. fuckedup orthography only cluds the (clouds)
      the unconvenient fact that it's the form of a cunt (the pubic
      triangle, so it probably was the most decent word for this thing)
      <br>
      I went on descibing it further, but I promised G-d not to produce
      porn, so I had to delete it.<br>
      UWVXZY?<br>
      Is XZ or Z some kind of festival after the last dying moon? The
      funerals? A ritual to make it return? Checking the order, that
      goddess hasn't left us, here is whence fear of eclipses could
      grow. Redmoon is not that inevitable by days, so it was recognized
      to be random. So the guys who understood the mooves of planets
      undermined religious vies that it's some dragon attacks the moon.
      <br>
      I actually came to notice that M is the Moon goddess. Mother is
      the moon. Because gods are traditionally believed to give us birth
      and women menstruate at some moon fase. So the connection between
      moon and motherhood is obvious. You can also count pregnancy by
      the weeks <font color="#cccccc">(those very faces of the moon)</font>
      you don't menstruate. And сорок = срок (forty = forth, push,

      <font color="#cccccc">Now this paragraph was written under the

      Before I hit those tokes, I theoresize that if M is moon, like W
      it's full moon (full and fool and moon coul be cognates. I havent'
      smoked yet, just look at their consonants) It correlates to the
      tridevi of ΛΜΝ reflecting UVW, or should I say UWV and this way it
      indeed reflects it more. I didn't expect it when I usex X to place
      full moon between wax &amp; wane<br>
      If M indeed stands for moon, then it could explain its shift from
      the labial position, or if that concept of triple deity is
      originally present in the alphabet, then L and I are cognates.<br>
      <br>
      Finally I found the origin or the most wonderful sensory
      hallucination I had on the most weird weed trip I ever had: I
      listened to audiotape of dm's ultra and some sounds of that felt
      like a needle in my eardrum. And then I had another one: dental
      drrill between my teeth and I just rediscovered it: I san some
      middle-low note and moved my head, so it resonated on my nose, and
      I moved my head to move the resonance to different parts of my
      body, and occasionally it was my teeth, they resonated well,
      ringing against eachother (I lefe a minimal distance between them
      but without complete shuttning) and they reminded me that feeling
      of the dental drill. Only it was more pronounced that time, when I
      was high into the sky (when I smoked as much as I never did
      before, but the weird was good, because never since smoking too
      much caused anything of the kind) – I should make the experiment
      of this humming listening to DM Ultra in headphones in a
      comfortable sofa, switching equalizer too. And in analogue.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I see it as my task to spread my knowledge even among profane
      audience. It was prohibited, and me myself, naturally, by some
      instinct to prevent theft, used to conceal this knowledge. And
      when I spread this knowledge, to my surprise almost nobody cared.
      So I consider the interest and possibility to see sufficient to
      filter out those who don't have those. <br>
      Thus "Information wants to be free"<br>
      Why I see spreading information as my task is possibility of new
      dark ages, so the more people know this, the better is the chance
      to preserve these obscure elements of human culture.<br>
      Some elements of that knowledge contain potentially dangerous e<font
        color="#cccccc">l</font>ements: knowledge of rejuvenating
      features of young blood can cause ritual cannibalism. And that
      raises jq and the question is "will those rituals be promoted
      bymohels if artificial blood will be more juvene than those of the
      babies?"<br>
      bymohels. and I dont correct it. It seems I began to encode my
      information to make some additional filters, because politics
      interests not only scientists.<br>

      I have an interesting azbuka (alphabet for kids) on my blackboard,

      watermelon. Many words begin with А are not authentically russian
      (арба, абажур, алфавит, азбука(?) арифметика, астрономия,,,
      андатра? it's ондатра. О is 0? O is whole. B is two halves, ᚦ (D)
      is one half - and that is how the story ends.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">My fingers evn wrone "and this is how this

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found two of those. And none of them denotes
      k as / which is only natural, because they didn't use it for
      russian.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I already notice that they recognized / as ch,
      j, r or as t, d, z, ch, j <br>
      ch &amp; j is common in those systems. Which can testify of the
      common predecessor, or it could be a coincidence of course, to see
      what it is let's collect all the similarities:<br>
      They are very similar in that they collect letters in similar
      groups: <br>
      KG (straight horizontals in pitman, curved horizontals in gregg)<br>
      MN (straight horizontals in gregg, curved horizontals in pitman)<br>
      both groups sorta open this chart, which reminds us of hindu and
      meta-hindu scripts beginning with K, and MN as the followup group
      reminds how it goes in the alphabet and that it challenges the
      priority of K as labials tend to go before velars in the alphabet.<br>
      NG seem to be the closest to N in the both of shorthands.<br>
      PB are grouped in both shorthands, just as TD only Gregg invented
      to make voiced ones longer (but in practice they could be pretty
      much the same, ust as pitman doesn't care if it's pen or ben. ben
      is longer.<br>
      S is its onw thing in both, only in gregg it could be grouped with
      PB, as an even shorter P, strange. <br>
      And there are two ways to write S, two S's, <font

          face="MathJax_Fraktur" size="+2">SS </font></font>σσ ςς σς ᛋᛋ
      is it why they made up that ß?<br>
      wiki tells that they didn't, that it existed long before: <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9F"><img

        size="+1">The ſs ligature used for Latin in 16th-century </font><br>
      Two THs, gregg treats them the same way he treated Ss, and that
      makes S &amp; TH invariants in gregg.<br>
      SH &amp; H are somewhat similar in gregg which correlates with
      what I said of H standing for SH<br>
      Gregg treats L as voiced form of R which is interesting. <br>
      <br>
      Here I see that some forms of Pitman are indeed similar to
      aboriginal syllabary of Canada. <br>
      But I argue that the structure is all different, so this
      similarity could be accidental or rather directly used to explain
      secondariness of the aboriginal writings to the european not even
      alphabet but shorthand. As if it was some game for that
      missionary. For otherwise he would directly apply one of existing
      shorthands, or rather would use latin alphabet as in many other
      cases it took place.<br>

      is it because dolphin shows some of its back and shark swims

      here you can see that of those 5 lines only йклмн breat the
      convenient evenness of the consonants,<br>
      if we think of winding those consonants around the vowels,<br>
      and in that line we have Й and, as I mentioned before, Й &amp; Ё

      </font>I have to admit it is the most weird axial symmetry <font
        color="#cccccc">(if we didn't remove Й &amp; Ё there'd be none
        at all)</font><br>
      The one which can compete with it in strangeness is another
      post-christian, armenian, on form of which arranges into axial,
      but also has weird forms, I gave it in the first voluem, so I go
      further. I return to arabic abjad, because if we rearrange it
      according to its modern form, it too has the conjunction &amp;(и,
      و)<br>

      <br>
      I'm tired of trying arabic letters to behave and allow spacebars
      on the left of it, so I give it to your imagination.<br>
      As you can see, if we shift the vowel position on on position, we
      get an unarrangeable odd number of consonants in the residue. <br>
      And I didn't expect to see in that neck that very similar to И ی<br>
      so allow me to rearrange it into how I saw it with و (which is
      similar to и not phonetically or graphically, but semantically) as
      its neck:<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#ff0000">ا&nbsp;</font> <br>
      ب ج د ه<br>
      &nbsp;<font color="#ff0000">و</font> <br>

      &nbsp;ر ش ت ث خ ذ ض ظ غ<br>
      <br>
      But still 9 letters in the final line of the axis, thus modern
      arabic alphabet isn't arranging into axials, and thus the ancient
      one, more similar to jewish is truer. Also because it doesn't have
      those lame necks.<br>

      &nbsp;This list includes phonetic symbols for the transcription of
      English sounds, plus others that are used in this class for
      transliterating or transcribing various languages, with the
      articulatory description of the sounds and some extra comments
      where appropriate.<br>
      <br>
      These symbols do not always follow the standard IPA (International
      Phonetic Alphabet) usage — rather, they reflect the practices for
      the languages treated in this course, which are sometimes a bit
      idiosyncratic due to separate scholarly traditions. In some cases,
      a second line shows a different use of the same symbol, normally
      for another language or family of languages. Nevertheless, the
      list is by no means exhaustive; for example, most pinyin symbols
      for transcribing Mandarin are not listed here; see week 5.<br>
      <br>
      You certainly don't need to memorize all these symbols, but you
      can use this page as a reference if you're not sure what a
      particular symbol means when you encounter it. Remember that you
      need a Unicode-compatible browser to see these symbols correctly.
      If you're not sure how to produce special symbols in your word
      processor, you can cut and paste from this page. <br>
