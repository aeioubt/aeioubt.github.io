          them somewhat less. Though soil, not air is the more common
          among elemental systems, what if it's the both. Air is the
          product of the earth, without the soil there would be no air.
          And ש is the chaotic energy which is some other force, and it
          makes us guests from space? Otherwise we would be the Earth

          And I go on with my research: <br>
          Х ~ Ж if we recognize X as stavless Ж, ᚷ as stavless ᚼ<br>
          Also because J can be read as Ж [j] in french, but as ᚷ [h] in
          spanish<br>
          And position of russian Ж correlate greek H (and Z is after
          it, not in front as in greek. So does it make greek later
          relating to russian? In russian second row Z stands in the
          end, not in the front, but do russians have F after E? No, but
          Ё. (I spoke about it whether in this version or look for older
          ones in web archive)<br>
          <br>
          ᚷ as stavless ᚼ exp;ains hot ~ жара and makes me believe
          that's the same t as in to, which comes ть in russian &amp; る
          in japanese. (I)t seems to come ra in russian, while in verbs

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also notice, that it has B, but not ti. And
          I think I found my H, as bekar after b, notice how ♮ resembles
          h, so it could be the source of the B/H misnomination, but I

          Surprise is that in my own city lives another kid who've found
          something incredible in russian alphabet:<br>
          <a href="https://roouh.livejournal.com/133411.html"><img
              src="III_files/58102_800.png" alt="" height="139"

          <br>
          We see K breaking sequence once again (does it mean it wasn't
          tabooed, it wasn't invented in those ancient abecedarias of
          some archaic latin <font color="#999999">(I'm not sure that
            period is named archaic, you look it up yourself if you care
            of the exact taxonomy)</font><br>
          Also П can be an invariant of R which would go farting (the
          sound only some most ancient native americans lost in the
          jungle speak this sound. That 3-vowel tribe, I wrote about
          them, I don't remember the name.<br>
          This sequence of voiced-sonors-voiceless. Is not present in
          english, but we know that G is invariant of C and that C used
          to sound like G, at least I read it. <br>
          It is arranged as if students begin loud and clear in voiced
          forms of the letters, but getting tired their voices became
          less clear until it switched off completely and only wisper
          would come out. O &amp; especially У are way more tired than A
          &amp; E, vowels could also influence the enthusiasm of
          pronunciation. So it could be either appear this way
          naturally, or be arranged this way to ease the reading of the
          alphabet. <br>
          Let's see if such a sequence is present in any of other

            three groups, for ЙЛМНР are all named sonors: [jlmnr] but
            I'd rather believe that they're untuned by insertion of K
            and originally there was no K &amp; they all were voiced.
            Then R is also out of sequence, and as K &amp; R are
            graphically similar, it seems we found another key to this
            clockwork, for I always wondered how could it be that P is R
            in russian? Bornholm runic alphabet also doesn't have P, so

          is somewhere near greek: <br>
          the only difference is that postionian greek doesn't see H as
          [h]<br>
          and that hebrew includes some additional letters (surprise!)
          but <br>
          they are voiceless, so who knows maybe it tells that they
          follow <br>
          this voiced-voicelss tendency more.<br>
          <br>
          So is it just a coincidence, which became quasi-structure in
          one<br>
          of them, or is it common among all of them one way or another.<br>
          I would look for some structural tendency if latin shows no<br>
          tendency of having more voiced in the first half.<br>
          <br>
          But P instead of B, T instead of D, I think this
          voiced-voiceless is set from the initial ABD/VFH <br>
          but let's conduct the experiment:<br>
          <br>
          A <font color="#ff0000">B</font> <font color="#33cc00">C</font>
          <font color="#ff0000">D</font> E <font color="#33cc00">F</font>
          <font color="#ff0000">G</font> <font color="#33cc00">H</font>

          <font color="#33cc00">S T</font> U <font color="#ff0000">V W</font>
          <font color="#33cc00">X</font> <font color="#ff0000">Y Z</font><br>
          <br>
          Еven in latin second half has more voiceless letters, but it's
          on the brink of losing this tendency completely:<br>
          First half contains 4 voiceless: CFHK<br>
          Second half contains 5 voiceless: PQSTX <font color="#cccccc">(even
            though the second half as we broke it is 2 letters shorter)</font><br>
          And if we cound voiced, then <br>
          First half contains 7 voiced: BDGJLMN<br>
          Second half contains 5 voiced: RVWYZ (and if we count VW as 1
          &amp; Y as vowel, even less: 3)<br>
          But if we remember that LMN are the beginning of the second
          half of the alphabet (as official etymology of "element"
          tells) then it's only 4 voiced in the first half, and even if
          we exclude W &amp; Y it's 6 against 4, which breaks the
          tendency. <br>

          well, in this case first half has 5 voiced, and the second -
          only 4 (but if we turn W back on?)<br>
          <br>
          It could also happen this way in latin because of some reform
          of sharing the voiced through the structure, not to make the
          pyramid way to obvious that bottom doesn't have a say.<br>
          <br>
          Anyway, latin is an exception among those I've seen above,
          let's look into georgian alphabet, to see if it's just some
          hellenic fluctuation or some truer symmetry, which could be
          cause by BD PT of some ancient unknown alphabet, mama first
          papa second, baba dada also go this way, and if some southern
          nations call papa baba, this deserves its own research.<br>
          <br>
          The reason I throw away R &amp; not P is because the grapheme
          P is known in both latin &amp; russian <font color="#666666">&amp;
            greek,</font> while R is only in latin. Also cursive k is
          even more similar to R than K and we need P as labial in our
          common structure of ABCD (notice that ABC also has voiced
          before voiceless) <br>
          then russians have П but no Р (could russian Р be invariant of
          П as if it's voiced form, even though it wasn't voice but
          bright vibration of lips. So could be R voiceless too (then we
          don't have to exclude it here) for it's brightness is not
          necessary on vocal cords, for it comes from tongue &amp;
          alveols?<br>

          Surprisingly, in georgian voiced-voiceless tendency is less
          preserved than even in greek &amp; hebrew <br>
          <font color="#cccccc">(or is it, on contrary, promoted) </font>for
          not only R but several other voiced letters appear in the
          second half.<br>
          Still it's more obvious than in latin, especially if we split
          it as it is, however we break it the most of voiceless are in
          the second half. But if M is the central letter, both halves
          have the same ammount of voiced.<br>
          <br>
          In conclusion to this paragraph I have to say that this
          tendency is definitely present, but if it's artificially
          conceived or has it occured naturally this is almost
          impossible to say, probably reformers of russian alphabet
          noticed this tendency and fostered it a little.<br>
          <br>
          This tendency also supports the idea of russian В being placed
          in the place of F, for it could be voiced before, they say it
          used to be W - semitic vav is voiced. And В looks like θ which
          used to belong somethere.<br>
