      Be and Do are two opposite simplest verbs.
      <br>
      B and D oppose each other on many levels: <br>
      ·õí and ·ö¶ stand for them in alphabetic runestone from Bornholm.<br>
      ·ö† and ·ö¥ standing for F–ì support this symmetry.<br>
      labials are double, because lips are two. linguals are one,
      because tongue is one. and it goes on:<br>
      ·õò for M and all of it's lingual counterparts ·ö¥·õö·öø can support this
      structure.<br>
      in the fourh line there's double staff ·ö¢ like the double ·õÅ just
      like u is double …™. like y is ij is double eye.<br>
      Like ìáå is double ìáã oh yes these traditions go far. <br>
      The following part is the rawest, so I say probably. Probably in
      ogham there's only one stroke and two strokes. and all the rest is
      it's combinations: one stroke consonants are M B H (those who
      learnt japanese know that h and b are variants of one another.
      that h sound in japanese also stands for F, P and in it's basic
      form HA (they use syllabary) it is pronounced as WA, The most
      common wa similar to english be (both are labial) they use all the
      time. So it's probably not Ha, dotted and stroked, but W for
      whatever reason reduced to H in a weak position? Especially
      because it's grouped previous to M (sillabaries like to combine by
      articulation features) and next to N. But there's an off-set for
      this guess: kanas have another W- line, but it could be a later
      addition, happening due to loss of W- line because of that
      incorrect guess of the line from its weaker position? That Ha
      reading as Wa reminds russian –ì–æ —á–∏—Ç–∞—é—â–µ–µ—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ –í–æ –≤ —á–µ–≥–æ [—á–µ–≤–æ]
      –∫–æ–≥–æ [–∫–∞–≤–æ] –µ–≥–æ [–∏–≤–æ] and later I will look into it if that is the
      same morpheme (russians and japanese have very similar morphemes:
      <br>
      adjectives end at -i<br>
      casus genetivus is made by -no<br>
      and there was something else, I don't remember at the moment.<br>
      -hoshi for "want" reminds russian hochu for "want"<br>
      and there are lots of similar lexics, which can be used if not for
      direct etymology, for mnemonic facilitation of cross-learning of
      the languages. Imagine how less of conflicts there will be if
      cultures merge into one another at it's margins. Leaders will
      probably not like it, and probably that's why movies are dubbed in
      United States in America and United States of Soviet Russia,
      because where they're subbed (Northern Europe) almost everybody
      knows several languages. This piece of information may be useful,
      but I have to get back on track:<br>
      B &amp; D oppose eachother in many forms, but more often simply
      reflecting eachother: <br>
      b &amp; d, –ë &amp; –î,&nbsp; ‚∞Ç &amp; ‚∞ï, even ìÉÄ and ìÇß, and these
      two are bothe reflection and doubling.<br>
      In glagolica given in unicode it's B &amp; T, the first two
      consonants from the ancient greek myth of "The Three Fates or,
      some say, Io the sister of Phoroneus, invented five vowels of the
      first alphabet, and the consonants B and T" and in one row those B
      &amp; T are the very B &amp; D. But it's still weird, and can
      witness that glagolic script can have some prehistoric roots,
      maybe that's why that litic in glagolitic, just in case here are
      those B &amp; D in some other font:<br>
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E2%B0%82#/media/File:Glagoljica_Vedi.svg<br>
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E2%B0%B4#/media/File:GlagolitsaDobro.gif<br>
      Here's the D that font I used has: ‚∞Ñ (reminds ‚∞ï and a little ‚∞é,
      and D is between L &amp; T, hm..)<br>
      In that other font T reminds the lower part of the ‚∞é - didn't find
      the form in a separate image<br>
      B &amp; T also oppose each other in a weird symmetry around «©,
      which could be the central letter, before M (which is historically
      registered "central letter") became one after another line of
      letters was added.<br>
      <br>
      But back to ogham, the dual strokes are GLD, all made by tongue,
      also it may explain why cursive g stands for d in russian and why
      jewish g ◊í look pretty much like greek l Œª.<br>
      There are also single dot (or a short stroke) standing for a
      (which makes sense, a stands for 1) and double dot standing for o,
      which also makes perfect sense: in runes ·öÆ is double ·õÜ and in
      dannish aa is o.<br>
      Triple strokes in ogham are Ng V T, but they could be Ng N T,
      because ogham is named beth luis nion. So probably when this name
      appeared, there were only 1, 2 &amp; 3. and 3 was a combination of
      1 &amp; 2 and N is. Ng also is, T in it's articulation is similar
      to the other two, but it doesn't have labal in it more than m is t
      in russian cursive —Ç, which was always weird to me, just as n is
      cursive p (–ø) there. also lingual and labial oppose each other and
      odd number is for the lingual and even number of legs is for
      labial, are they of eve and add'm? or is that odd counterpart —É–¥?
      (ud) then v is vulva, vlagalische, vena as a gal.<br>
      A of Adam &amp; V of eVe oppose eachother in that k-symmetry, and
      they are the first and the last letters in archaic latin (that
      could be when that symmetry was noticed or built-in) and if JK
      (whethere as JesusKristos or JupiterKronos were tabooed off or
      never existed there when M stood in its lawful position after the
      vowel (just as almost every other labial does) ) then L was the
      central letter. but if M stood after I, was it the central letter
      even then? IML? where L~N, just as ·õö ~ ·öø (if that vertical bar is
      the common staff, then they're hardly distinguishable from one
      another, just as in case of staveless forms.. that oghamic T could
      be in the second position (to oppose the labial 1... but why was
      it the opposite to the way it is in every other writing system??
      for what reason singulars are labials and duals are lingual? Could
      it be because the writing system was invented by wemen, like it is
      said twice in that myth? Lust jike ma√∞ur stands for man.&nbsp;
      Could it be because Ma is the first word almost all over the
      world? Then ogham is the origin of alphabetic writings, which
      correlate its the uttermost primitive form, but opposes the
      official history)<br>
      The principle of labial first also goes for oghamic vowels, where
      the order is AOUEI, which is pretty much the opposite in this
      account to the way everybody else have them, AIU almost all over
      the world, whether it's in 3-vowel writing systems of old-persian
      cunieform or writing systems of philippines. Even in japanese kana
      additional E &amp; O were added after those three (we inserted
      them next to there parent forms (but then is I the new E?))<br>
      Which could be when they borrowed vowels they didn't use before (I
      read some vowelless ogham was discovered in Northern America
      recently, so it's a great journesy to make in researching what it
      all is about)<br>

      For many months (not from now, but at least since I began this
      volume) I've been working in my drafts, and I'm not sure I have
      properly layed out all the breakthroughs which there definitely
      happened, so I put them here to put them out as those which were
      made simultaneously with this text.<br>
