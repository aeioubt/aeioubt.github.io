        color="#cccccc"> this is a draft part, it may seem that I
        stumble around some random rhymes, but that's how I always was
        working and some cool stuff came out of it, so the most solid
        info is the first half of the first volume, all the rest is raw
        as odb loved it or more. several cool notes appeared afterwards,
        so I keep it online just in case and because ever wanted to read
        drafts of scientists.</font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Let's list the main points of this work so far:<br>
      <br>
      alphabetic order has some structures if lined out in planar tables<br>
      1. when it's cut into lines beginning with vowels.<br>
      2. when it's cut into lines which has vowels in centre of lines,
      and some vowelless lines are allwed if they are even only. But not
      all alphabets can be arranged like this, but some of them arrange
      into it nicely, so probably even less people knew about such
      arrangement.<br>
      3. reflection between the halves (or folds around some important
      letters)<br>
      4. reading of that first arrangement when the diagonal of
      reflection is lined from the top left corner into the right bottom
      one. <br>
      These four hypotheses are arranged by the rate of my belief in
      them. I'm pretty sure hypothesis number 1 is numero uno indeed,
      it's most probably a historic arrangement, I met few records of
      this structure, one from a modern-day amateur scientist, one from
      one english book, one from one indian book. I found that structure
      independently and it came frist or the second after the third.
      (hypothesis 2 came in the 3rd, and hypothesis 4 is the most recent
      one, it literally was born in the end of the previous volume)<br>
      <br>
      Also transcription cannot be trusted 100% as all the science have
      reflected on itself and discovered a replication crises, of which
      I think I was aware of, because I knew I had to do it from
      scratch, but I was motivated by some linguistic forum to dig
      further in the past to be taken more seriously, so I followed that
      ruiling.<br>
      <br>
      Christian claims that it's them invented all those writing systems
      are false. <br>
      <br>
      Also some open threads to ancient egyptian, music theory, both
      iberias, chinese, native american, african and polynesian writing
      systems, some mystical and mythological references, leading to
      whole that culture to find relating pieces and gesture language
      can be a source of theorizings, and there are probably more, ogham
      of course.<br>
      <br>
      These claims are up to you to find out how credible am I, I think
      I trust them pretty well.<br>
      (I lay out the argumentations for them in the previous volume.
      here my task is to go further, and I think a good and perspective
      source for research is the short words of some old european
      language such as latin in relation to modern european languages
      and how the same short pieces relate in them.<br>
      <br>
      a = 1, to,&nbsp; well I didn't expect the reference to 1 2, but
      here it is. a is but in russian, which also follows a. <br>
      of об <br>
      в was v in russian and б was where ё is now?<br>
      <br>
      de оf <br>
      до to<br>
      <br>
      is есть - why does modal word has the to in russian?<br>
      <br>
      am ем <br>
      <br>
      are&nbsp; ести<br>
      <br>
      are am is as AMS<br>
      Вы Я Он<br>
      В could be the b, the prehistorically first letter.<br>
      I as the centre between A &amp; V.<br>
      N of он is the final letter of its' line, and could be lmn the xyz
      of the past? <br>
      also N is ν<br>
      <br>
      VIN? ni = мы? я тоже последняя. V was the last and that's W of we.<br>
      VJN? and Он as the alphabetic sequence is <br>
      <br>
      чем могут быть алфавитные слова как не следом более древней
      системы? и слово ёж предстало как базовым как еда, и представить,
      что люди начинали звероловство с поедания ежей можно представить
      очень даже: в еже мяса как раз на раз, другие звери их скорей
      всего не умели ловить а человек знал, что можно тупо камнем убить
      его. ежи кусаются, так что да, руками ловить погано. Возможно, мы
      делали себе одежду из шкурок ежа. Любопытно было бы посмотреть.<br>
      Но скорей всего эта дрянь колкая, так что наверное нет. Может на
      щит разве что прибивали как оружие, но тоже своих же поколишь
      некстати. так что наверное нет. еж еда и только.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      A guy contacted me about his app and I thought that he will be
      more interested in some other research:<br>
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Znx-odtXgw8 (Global Alphabet by
      Yuliana Gorokhov)<br>
      and though I first thought it was purely an artistic project,
      watching it now I see that she speaks of historical unity of all
      those alphabets. And it makes her work much more interesting, and
      she even removes the first stroke of Л the way it obviously is a
      swash when you compare cursive Л and l.<br>
      <font color="#999999">but then I watch further and I notice that
        she doesn't reconstruct the prehistoric unity, but turns it into
        truly an artistic project, which makes it less interesting for
        me, but the latin-arabic font is cool)</font><br>
      <br>
      And when I searched for it, alphabet ted, I found an african
      professor speaking of ancient arabic writing systems, and here's a
      tidbit:<br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbIewxHQrk"><img
          src="9_files/vai.png" alt="" width="1227" height="768"
          border="0"></a><br>
      <br>
      and there he recommends his book, which also contains many sources
      for research:<br>
      <br>

      <font color="#cccccc">(I link it to a pirated version of his book,
        it also cannot into ctrlF, so it's a demo version, for all of
        you to see how beautiful is this book, of what perfect quality
        is its pictures. It seems old russian or european equipment was
        sent to africa and preserved there pretty well. Pirates do break
        some unjust laws, and I justify that because I give them free
        promotion, either way how am I less worthy than librusec where I
        found it. Sharing is caring. Pirating boosts sales because it
        promotes) I would mirror, but it's too big.</font><br>
      I selected this one image, because it can indicate how muslim
      missionaries also lied about their inventions, That time people
      knew of much more useful writing systems, why would they use
      african system a little, but not completely, why does it go
      labials first if modern scholars didn't know that? Why would it be
      named ki ka ku as if it has som other, the eastern order and only
      three vowels. And notice that signs with a i u go syllabricly with
      diacritic over the same sign, and other syllables are off this
      structure, completely arbitrary. So maybe that guy did invent it,
      adding his silly additional syllables to the ones used before him.
      to the original Ki Ka Ku. KKK is some psy-op, so it seems, it
      could hit africans with godly awe via these synapses, no wonder
      they were scared. It was a psy-op, a terrorizing.<br>

      but ы is the opposite of я in this claster.<br>
      <br>
      la is modified ы, ы is some abstract vowel, and probably that's
      how they sang before they learned to merge vowels with consonants
      into syllables. <br>

      ы are both of i-claster, unless у is y and я is а. are ы and я
      both y's and that's how it splits from where it splits into u and
      i (both can be a, because of bus and i's name's ai)<br>

      <font size="+1">Пуруша (др.-инд. पुरुष, puruṣa IAST, «человек,
        мужчина, дух») — согласно индуистской мифологии, существо, из
        тела которого была создана Вселенная.<br>
        <br>
        В Ригведе жертвоприношению Пуруши посвящён отдельный гимн —
        Пуруша-сукта. Пуруша — Наслаждающийся — четырнадцатое из 1000
        имён Вишну.<br>
        <br>
        В индийской философии термин «пуруша» означает «божественный
        дух», макрокосм. В философии санкхьи пуруша — множественное
        неподвижное мужское (духовное) космическое начало, «чистое
        сознание», созерцающее динамичное женское начало — пракрити
        (материя). Пуруши являются вечными, их основные свойства —
        отсутствие свойств (ниргуна). Однако Пуруша, созерцающий
        пракрити, склонен ошибочно идентифицировать себя с ней и с
        гунами.<br>
        <br>
        В первоначальном учении присутствовал тезис о множественности
        пуруш (пуруша-бахутвам), тогда как в позднейших трактатах
        провозглашался уже принцип единого пуруши, наделяемого
        качествами, близкими к атрибутам атмана Упанишад. </font><br>

      The word renown shows that k in known is a prefix. Probably, the
      same as in russian к which is to.<br>
      and then now is probably now and n is a suffix of the past or done
      as in done and gone.<br>

      𓄿 in simpler representation can give 𐲀 as back and beak and A as

          height="594" border="0"></a><br>
      here A regains its beak as if it simply rotated its head or maybe
      itself in the form of A and with swash it rotates its head to its
      right.<br>
      Swash of G makes <i>g</i> even closer to d (both meet again in <i>g</i>
      being russian d)<br>
      And it gives us ABᚦ EFG <br>
      and next H is a form of I, a double I, and swashed form of J shows
      that it's half a I, a י (is it why they thought hebrew didn't have
      vowels? Because I was shorter than theirs? Then such tendency
      existed? Arabs spoke their semitic language at least a millenium
      longer and they have ה which is vowel in half of hebrew examples
      is completely consonant in arabic ه also why o is in the e-line?
      is efg actually opq?<br>
