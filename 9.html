        color="#cccccc"> this is a draft part, it may seem that I
        stumble around some random rhymes, but that's how I always was
        working and some cool stuff came out of it, so the most solid
        info is the first half of the first volume, all the rest is raw
        as odb loved it or more. several cool notes appeared afterwards,
        so I keep it online just in case and because ever wanted to read
        drafts of scientists.</font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Let's list the main points of this work so far:<br>
      <br>
      alphabetic order has some structures if lined out in planar tables<br>
      1. when it's cut into lines beginning with vowels.<br>
      2. when it's cut into lines which has vowels in centre of lines,
      and some vowelless lines are allwed if they are even only. But not
      all alphabets can be arranged like this, but some of them arrange
      into it nicely, so probably even less people knew about such
      arrangement.<br>
      3. reflection between the halves (or folds around some important
      letters)<br>
      4. reading of that first arrangement when the diagonal of
      reflection is lined from the top left corner into the right bottom
      one. <br>
      These four hypotheses are arranged by the rate of my belief in
      them. I'm pretty sure hypothesis number 1 is numero uno indeed,
      it's most probably a historic arrangement, I met few records of
      this structure, one from a modern-day amateur scientist, one from
      one english book, one from one indian book. I found that structure
      independently and it came frist or the second after the third.
      (hypothesis 2 came in the 3rd, and hypothesis 4 is the most recent
      one, it literally was born in the end of the previous volume)<br>
      <br>
      Also transcription of ancient texts cannot be trusted 100% as all
      the science have reflected on itself and discovered a replication
      crises, of which I think I was aware of, because I knew I had to
      do it from scratch, but I was motivated by some linguistic forum
      to dig further in the past to be taken more seriously, so I
      followed that ruiling.<br>
      <br>
      Christian claims that it's them invented all those writing systems
      are false. <br>
      <br>
      Also some open threads to ancient egyptian, music theory, both
      iberias, chinese, native american, african and polynesian writing
      systems, some mystical and mythological references, leading to
      whole that culture to find relating pieces and gesture language
      can be a source of theorizings, and there are probably more, ogham
      of course.<br>
      <br>
      These claims are up to you to find out how credible am I, I think
      I trust them pretty well.<br>
      (I lay out the argumentations for them in the previous volume.
      here my task is to go further, and I think a good and perspective
      source for research is the short words of some old european
      language such as latin in relation to modern european languages
      and how the same short pieces relate in them.<br>
      <br>
      a = 1, to,&nbsp; well I didn't expect the reference to 1 2, but
      here it is. a is but in russian, which also follows a. <br>
      of об <br>
      в was v in russian and б was where ё is now?<br>
      <br>
      de оf <br>
      до to<br>
      <br>
      is есть - why does modal word has the to in russian?<br>
      <br>
      am ем <br>
      <br>
      are&nbsp; ести<br>
      <br>
      are am is as AMS<br>
      Вы Я Он<br>
      В could be the b, the prehistorically first letter.<br>
      I as the centre between A &amp; V.<br>
      N of он is the final letter of its' line, and could be lmn the xyz
      of the past? <br>
      also N is ν<br>
      <br>
      VIN? ni = мы? я тоже последняя. V was the last and that's W of we.<br>
      VJN? and Он as the alphabetic sequence is <br>
      <br>
      чем могут быть алфавитные слова как не следом более древней
      системы? и слово ёж предстало как базовым как еда, и представить,
      что люди начинали звероловство с поедания ежей можно представить
      очень даже: в еже мяса как раз на раз, другие звери их скорей
      всего не умели ловить а человек знал, что можно тупо камнем убить
      его. ежи кусаются, так что да, руками ловить погано. Возможно, мы
      делали себе одежду из шкурок ежа. Любопытно было бы посмотреть.<br>
      Но скорей всего эта дрянь колкая, так что наверное нет. Может на
      щит разве что прибивали как оружие, но тоже своих же поколишь
      некстати. так что наверное нет. еж еда и только.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      A guy contacted me about his app and I thought that he will be
      more interested in some other research:<br>
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Znx-odtXgw8 (Global Alphabet by
      Yuliana Gorokhov)<br>
      and though I first thought it was purely an artistic project,
      watching it now I see that she speaks of historical unity of all
      those alphabets. And it makes her work much more interesting, and
      she even removes the first stroke of Л the way it obviously is a
      swash when you compare cursive Л and l.<br>
      <font color="#999999">but then I watch further and I notice that
        she doesn't reconstruct the prehistoric unity, but turns it into
        truly an artistic project, which makes it less interesting for
        me, but the latin-arabic font is cool)</font><br>
      <br>
      And when I searched for it, alphabet ted, I found an african
      professor speaking of ancient arabic writing systems, and here's a
      tidbit:<br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbIewxHQrk"><img
          src="9_files/vai.png" alt="" width="1227" height="768"
          border="0"></a><br>
      <br>
      and there he recommends his book, which also contains many sources
      for research:<br>
      <br>

      <font color="#cccccc">(I link it to a pirated version of his book,
        it also cannot into ctrlF, so it's a demo version, for all of
        you to see how beautiful is this book, of what perfect quality
        is its pictures. It seems old russian or european equipment was
        sent to africa and preserved there pretty well. Pirates do break
        some unjust laws, and I justify that because I give them free
        promotion, either way how am I less worthy than librusec where I
        found it. Sharing is caring. Pirating boosts sales because it
        promotes) I would mirror, but it's too big.</font><br>
      I selected this one image, because it can indicate how muslim
      missionaries also lied about their inventions, That time people
      knew of much more useful writing systems, why would they use
      african system a little, but not completely, why does it go
      labials first if modern scholars didn't know that? Why would it be
      named ki ka ku as if it has som other, the eastern order and only
      three vowels. And notice that signs with a i u go syllabricly with
      diacritic over the same sign, and other syllables are off this
      structure, completely arbitrary. So maybe that guy did invent it,
      adding his silly additional syllables to the ones used before him.
      to the original Ki Ka Ku. KKK is some psy-op, so it seems, it
      could hit africans with godly awe via these synapses, no wonder
      they were scared. It was a psy-op, a terrorizing.<br>

      but ы is the opposite of я in this claster.<br>
      <br>
      la is modified ы, ы is some abstract vowel, and probably that's
      how they sang before they learned to merge vowels with consonants
      into syllables. <br>

      so I lay it out in this oghamic order.<br>
      da du di could be да do ты or duh, du дей. opposite or not, я and
      ы are both of i-claster, unless у is y and я is а. are ы and я
      both y's and that's how it splits from where it splits into u and
      i (both can be a, because of bus and i's name's ai)<br>

      <font size="+1">Пуруша (др.-инд. पुरुष, puruṣa IAST, «человек,
        мужчина, дух») — согласно индуистской мифологии, существо, из
        тела которого была создана Вселенная.<br>
        <br>
        В Ригведе жертвоприношению Пуруши посвящён отдельный гимн —
        Пуруша-сукта. Пуруша — Наслаждающийся — четырнадцатое из 1000
        имён Вишну.<br>
        <br>
        В индийской философии термин «пуруша» означает «божественный
        дух», макрокосм. В философии санкхьи пуруша — множественное
        неподвижное мужское (духовное) космическое начало, «чистое
        сознание», созерцающее динамичное женское начало — пракрити
        (материя). Пуруши являются вечными, их основные свойства —
        отсутствие свойств (ниргуна). Однако Пуруша, созерцающий
        пракрити, склонен ошибочно идентифицировать себя с ней и с
        гунами.<br>
        <br>
        В первоначальном учении присутствовал тезис о множественности
        пуруш (пуруша-бахутвам), тогда как в позднейших трактатах
        провозглашался уже принцип единого пуруши, наделяемого
        качествами, близкими к атрибутам атмана Упанишад. </font><br>

      The word renown shows that k in known is a prefix. Probably, the
      same as in russian к which is to.<br>
      and then now is probably now and n is a suffix of the past or done
      as in done and gone.<br>

      𓄿 in simpler representation can give 𐲀 as back and beak and A as

          height="594" border="0"></a><br>
      here A regains its beak as if it simply rotated its head or maybe
      itself in the form of A and with swash it rotates its head to its
      right.<br>
      Swash of G makes <i>g</i> even closer to d (both meet again in <i>g</i>
      being russian d)<br>
      And it gives us ABᚦ EFG <br>
      and next H is a form of I, a double I, and swashed form of J shows
      that it's half a I, a י (is it why they thought hebrew didn't have
      vowels? Because I was shorter than theirs? Then such tendency
      existed? Arabs spoke their semitic language at least a millenium
      longer and they have ה which is vowel in half of hebrew examples
      is completely consonant in arabic ه also why o is in the e-line?
      is efg actually opq?<br>

      Why is it here? Is it the decline? I'm highe for some many lines
      and many good ideas, such as:<br>
      snake lion snail as LNV lion is l, not n. snake is s, thus samekh?
      snail is literally snl. I wander in open space now, it's not much
      to do with anything, too far too soon. Attempt after attempt, but
      not in a row, leave it to boil for some time to maybe extract<br>
      <br>
      Any way, I go to https://drevlit.ru/egypt_dictionary_eng.html to
      see what is snake in egyptian, they pair hieroglyphs there, as
      mayans did. And I wonder if it's true, no, it's just their trick
      having not too much of a relation to reality, where 1,2,3
      hieroglyphs went drawn in a line, but never by two:<br>

      I wonder how authentic these texts are, because why would
      hieroglyphs looked different ways. Here's another one unreliable
      the same way (I think I read something about boustrophedonism of
      some egyptian texts, but look how lazy my research is, I don't go
      to check it, I leave it raw as drafts may allow, so I think that
      the previous and the following couple are modern collages)<br>

      Х said about А that he's a dark (or black) genius, and she wants a
      white one.<br>
      So is it good to cooperate with a black wizard? Blacks tend to
      lose, black is bad.<br>
      Black and bad are probably cognates, human (at least russian) mind
      sees black a s bad.<br>
      I believe all the world does, at least the best half of it. So
      let's turn into <font color="#cccccc">white </font>light wizards<br>
      We're heavy, we work at nights, to fully concentrate, we wouldn't
      sing in daylight, rockers who gig at sunlight are faking the funk
      so to say, they suck, maybe manson went down because of being
      burned by the sun. burnt out at the sun. He would never play on
      day light if not the money. some diamond wizards buy everyone.
      Love can trump diamonds. Because hearts are higher than diamonds
      in card games. It came to me some long time ago, who knows how
      legit this spades, clubs, diamonds, hearts. Spade is the грубая
      сила. Clubs are police, conspirators, gosudarstvo. Diamonds are
      bourgeoisie. Hearts are love.<br>
      God is love. How did I arrange them, I don't konw. But looks more
      slick than shudra, kshatri, vayshna, brahman. shudras work with
      spades (in russian it's пики. т.е. орки-урки здесь живут, надо их
      перевоспитывать. Их пытаются загнобить, типа потому что они
      выёбистые, но на самом деле у них гиперкомпенсация (им постоянно
      нужно доказывать себе (но как будто другим) что они не лохи) и
      восстановление их самоуважения - более разумная задача
      исправительных органов, которая скорее всего практикуется в
      скандинавии (но это не точно)<br>
      <br>
      spades as water? because of the form of the sign <font
        color="#666666">♠</font>? as if a drop of water at the same base
      <font color="#666666">♣</font> has, which is naturally three
      (four) balls laying at eachother. as if stones would. So clubs are
      solid. Thus shudra are shit (жидкие, жидкий народец было более
      общим понятием, которое осталось лишь как самой презренной нации
      чуть ли не топоним. Язык изменяем, и открыв эти
      неполиткореектности в языке мы можем их исправить или научиться у
      них. А зачем нам древние понятия, мы начнём переписывать геномы и
      национальность станет ещё более размытым понятием: allegence to
      the flag, obedience to the state, a rudiment from apes or
      reasonable strategy? Clubs are strong not only because they can
      come winning with a club against a knife. Club is a great weapon,
      because it can cause less open bleeding, so it's easier to control
      if you want to beat a man or kill em. ими и им одно слово, и
      просто суффикс множественного числа, известный с незапамятных

      &nbsp;are rich people because vayshya and diamonds. And here I see
      that card deck and varnas have different opinions on whether
      vaishya higher or lower than kshatriyas. both are shudras from the
      pov of brahman, only vaishyas are rich shudras and kshatreys are
      key shudras. R &amp; K? Shudras are S pretty much qrs, pretty much
      all the linguals there are (t~s because ת without dot inside is
      read as th in thin) <br>
      Brahman is B, the labial. so is it k before r or after? q is
      before r, positionally yes, but chronologically r was before q,
      because q is not known to many alphabets, so first there were
      brahmans (shamans? shaman is shudra's brahkman? from the pov of
      the priests) and others were divided into rich and poor? no
      military among men, they're all military, and only later did good
      warriors unite against the others? How could it happen? When good
      fighter commited crime and peace in the city is not possible, the
      murderer would probably be expelled (execution is a paradox of
      murder for the murder: if murder is illegal why this one is? maybe
      that first murder was also justified not in less degree. Also good
      fighters saved lives, so it's also fair to forgive them for taking
      one? So expelled, and have to go the other city or to live in the
      woods, where he'd meet such good expelled warriors as them (did it
      became a law that they were to be killed not to let them be
      fighting for the city's enemies?) and gangs fought the cities and
      took control there and became the rulers, and the caste in itself.
      Kshatriyas are probably of this origin. So were rich people still
      higher than warriors? Rich people would hire warriors, to make
      them respectable. That's Europe. They can afford it. As a result,
      their economy is booming. boosted. (not doomed and busted) and
      poorfags of the east and south stand kshatriyas above vaishyas and
      as a result their countries don't know how to make money.<br>
      Brahmans of those countries should teach their societies to praise
      the rich, not higher-archers. The one who shoots further sits
      higher, because he is teh best for the best position.<br>
      Because brahman should rule with love, not fear. People should
      love success more than they fear death.<br>

      семян, если с семенами лучше: только трусы не нуждаются в семенах,
      чудесных, волшебных камушков, семена колдовские объекты. Гроверы
      нарассказывают кучу теорий как вещества пропадают, уходя на
      созревание семян, но практика показывает, что одна из лучших трав,
      которые я куривал была с хорошими зёрнами. Я трус, кстати, мне
      давали самые большие семена что я в жизни видел, я их проебал.
      Тупо проебал, может парочку друзьям подаривши, глупо, тупо,
      мудово. Русы трусы, в моём случае это точно. Мы слишком много
      думаем о самом худшем что может случиться, это у меня от бати,
      русские вайшьи же предприимчивы, они любят успех больше чем боятся
      неудачи. И как при слиянии шудры с вайшьей мог получиться брахман

      2. Vaporizer, also 9 letters (10 if sensemilla or sensemilja and
      vaporizers) whenever I smoked it, it only gave some body high, but

      I smoked hydro after I smoked.. what? The best grower I know grows
      in soil saying that hydro is not his kind of thing. And I smoked
      something I knew was hydro and I thought that hydroponic is
      probably another element of this conspiracy, and this formal

      in spanish R is R, but what's surprising v sounds as b<br>
      Labials are labials nobody guarantees anything else about them.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">Beba Veva sounds exactly the same in
        spanish? If google doesn't fool me, I think why would they.</font><br>
      Just as B sounds as V in russian, so V sounds as B in spanish. Is
      it the letter we should use instead of б? but б reflects <i>д</i>
      and Б reflects Д in a way, so why would we miss it, especially
      since B is Б in english, so why would we differ? and if use V, use
      it as V, so transfer to latin where you can? ц = ts, ч = ch, ш =
      sh, щ = sch. Take brittish orthography and they will love us for
      them. It's a source of love that will cost us rien. Nothing, rien,
      not rein. not reign, though people will read foreign press more.
      We'll be as european as poland. Russians will become more european
      than Vietnamese when they accept the superiority of latin
