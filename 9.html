        color="#cccccc"> this is a draft part, it may seem that I
        stumble around some random rhymes, but that's how I always was
        working and some cool stuff came out of it, so the most solid
        info is the first half of the first volume, all the rest is raw
        as odb loved it or more. several cool notes appeared afterwards,
        so I keep it online just in case and because ever wanted to read
        drafts of scientists.</font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Let's list the main points of this work so far:<br>
      <br>
      alphabetic order has some structures if lined out in planar tables<br>
      1. when it's cut into lines beginning with vowels.<br>
      2. when it's cut into lines which has vowels in centre of lines,
      and some vowelless lines are allwed if they are even only. But not
      all alphabets can be arranged like this, but some of them arrange
      into it nicely, so probably even less people knew about such
      arrangement.<br>
      3. reflection between the halves (or folds around some important
      letters)<br>
      4. reading of that first arrangement when the diagonal of
      reflection is lined from the top left corner into the right bottom
      one. <br>
      These four hypotheses are arranged by the rate of my belief in
      them. I'm pretty sure hypothesis number 1 is numero uno indeed,
      it's most probably a historic arrangement, I met few records of
      this structure, one from a modern-day amateur scientist, one from
      one english book, one from one indian book. I found that structure
      independently and it came frist or the second after the third.
      (hypothesis 2 came in the 3rd, and hypothesis 4 is the most recent
      one, it literally was born in the end of the previous volume)<br>
      <br>
      Also transcription of ancient texts cannot be trusted 100% as all
      the science have reflected on itself and discovered a replication
      crises, of which I think I was aware of, because I knew I had to
      do it from scratch, but I was motivated by some linguistic forum
      to dig further in the past to be taken more seriously, so I
      followed that ruiling.<br>
      <br>
      Christian claims that it's them invented all those writing systems
      are false. <br>
      <br>
      Also some open threads to ancient egyptian, music theory, both
      iberias, chinese, native american, african and polynesian writing
      systems, some mystical and mythological references, leading to
      whole that culture to find relating pieces and gesture language
      can be a source of theorizings, and there are probably more, ogham
      of course.<br>
      <br>
      These claims are up to you to find out how credible am I, I think
      I trust them pretty well.<br>
      (I lay out the argumentations for them in the previous volume.
      here my task is to go further, and I think a good and perspective
      source for research is the short words of some old european
      language such as latin in relation to modern european languages
      and how the same short pieces relate in them.<br>
      <br>
      a = 1, to,&nbsp; well I didn't expect the reference to 1 2, but
      here it is. a is but in russian, which also follows a. <br>
      of об <br>
      в was v in russian and б was where ё is now?<br>
      <br>
      de оf <br>
      до to<br>
      <br>
      is есть - why does modal word has the to in russian?<br>
      <br>
      am ем <br>
      <br>
      are&nbsp; ести<br>
      <br>
      are am is as AMS<br>
      Вы Я Он<br>
      В could be the b, the prehistorically first letter.<br>
      I as the centre between A &amp; V.<br>
      N of он is the final letter of its' line, and could be lmn the xyz
      of the past? <br>
      also N is ν<br>
      <br>
      VIN? ni = мы? я тоже последняя. V was the last and that's W of we.<br>
      VJN? and Он as the alphabetic sequence is <br>
      <br>
      чем могут быть алфавитные слова как не следом более древней
      системы? и слово ёж предстало как базовым как еда, и представить,
      что люди начинали звероловство с поедания ежей можно представить
      очень даже: в еже мяса как раз на раз, другие звери их скорей
      всего не умели ловить а человек знал, что можно тупо камнем убить
      его. ежи кусаются, так что да, руками ловить погано. Возможно, мы
      делали себе одежду из шкурок ежа. Любопытно было бы посмотреть.<br>
      Но скорей всего эта дрянь колкая, так что наверное нет. Может на
      щит разве что прибивали как оружие, но тоже своих же поколишь
      некстати. так что наверное нет. еж еда и только.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      A guy contacted me about his app and I thought that he will be
      more interested in some other research:<br>
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Znx-odtXgw8 (Global Alphabet by
      Yuliana Gorokhov)<br>
      and though I first thought it was purely an artistic project,
      watching it now I see that she speaks of historical unity of all
      those alphabets. And it makes her work much more interesting, and
      she even removes the first stroke of Л the way it obviously is a
      swash when you compare cursive Л and l.<br>
      <font color="#999999">but then I watch further and I notice that
        she doesn't reconstruct the prehistoric unity, but turns it into
        truly an artistic project, which makes it less interesting for
        me, but the latin-arabic font is cool)</font><br>
      <br>
      And when I searched for it, alphabet ted, I found an african
      professor speaking of ancient arabic writing systems, and here's a
      tidbit:<br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbIewxHQrk"><img
          src="9_files/vai.png" alt="" width="1227" height="768"
          border="0"></a><br>
      <br>
      and there he recommends his book, which also contains many sources
      for research:<br>
      <br>

      <font color="#cccccc">(I link it to a pirated version of his book,
        it also cannot into ctrlF, so it's a demo version, for all of
        you to see how beautiful is this book, of what perfect quality
        is its pictures. It seems old russian or european equipment was
        sent to africa and preserved there pretty well. Pirates do break
        some unjust laws, and I justify that because I give them free
        promotion, either way how am I less worthy than librusec where I
        found it. Sharing is caring. Pirating boosts sales because it
        promotes) I would mirror, but it's too big.</font><br>
      I selected this one image, because it can indicate how muslim
      missionaries also lied about their inventions, That time people
      knew of much more useful writing systems, why would they use
      african system a little, but not completely, why does it go
      labials first if modern scholars didn't know that? Why would it be
      named ki ka ku as if it has som other, the eastern order and only
      three vowels. And notice that signs with a i u go syllabricly with
      diacritic over the same sign, and other syllables are off this
      structure, completely arbitrary. So maybe that guy did invent it,
      adding his silly additional syllables to the ones used before him.
      to the original Ki Ka Ku. KKK is some psy-op, so it seems, it
      could hit africans with godly awe via these synapses, no wonder
      they were scared. It was a psy-op, a terrorizing.<br>

      but ы is the opposite of я in this claster.<br>
      <br>
      la is modified ы, ы is some abstract vowel, and probably that's
      how they sang before they learned to merge vowels with consonants
      into syllables. <br>

      ы are both of i-claster, unless у is y and я is а. are ы and я
      both y's and that's how it splits from where it splits into u and
      i (both can be a, because of bus and i's name's ai)<br>

      <font size="+1">Пуруша (др.-инд. पुरुष, puruṣa IAST, «человек,
        мужчина, дух») — согласно индуистской мифологии, существо, из
        тела которого была создана Вселенная.<br>
        <br>
        В Ригведе жертвоприношению Пуруши посвящён отдельный гимн —
        Пуруша-сукта. Пуруша — Наслаждающийся — четырнадцатое из 1000
        имён Вишну.<br>
        <br>
        В индийской философии термин «пуруша» означает «божественный
        дух», макрокосм. В философии санкхьи пуруша — множественное
        неподвижное мужское (духовное) космическое начало, «чистое
        сознание», созерцающее динамичное женское начало — пракрити
        (материя). Пуруши являются вечными, их основные свойства —
        отсутствие свойств (ниргуна). Однако Пуруша, созерцающий
        пракрити, склонен ошибочно идентифицировать себя с ней и с
        гунами.<br>
        <br>
        В первоначальном учении присутствовал тезис о множественности
        пуруш (пуруша-бахутвам), тогда как в позднейших трактатах
        провозглашался уже принцип единого пуруши, наделяемого
        качествами, близкими к атрибутам атмана Упанишад. </font><br>

      The word renown shows that k in known is a prefix. Probably, the
      same as in russian к which is to.<br>
      and then now is probably now and n is a suffix of the past or done
      as in done and gone.<br>

          height="594" border="0"></a><br>
      here A regains its beak as if it simply rotated its head or maybe
      itself in the form of A and with swash it rotates its head to its
      right.<br>
      Swash of G makes <i>g</i> even closer to d (both meet again in <i>g</i>
      being russian d)<br>
      And it gives us ABᚦ EFG <br>
      and next H is a form of I, a double I, and swashed form of J shows
      that it's half a I, a י (is it why they thought hebrew didn't have
      vowels? Because I was shorter than theirs? Then such tendency
      existed? Arabs spoke their semitic language at least a millenium
      longer and they have ה which is vowel in half of hebrew examples
      is completely consonant in arabic ه also why o is in the e-line?
      is efg actually opq?<br>

      Why is it here? Is it the decline? I'm highe for some many lines
      and many good ideas, such as:<br>
      snake lion snail as LNV lion is l, not n. snake is s, thus samekh?
      snail is literally snl. I wander in open space now, it's not much
      to do with anything, too far too soon. Attempt after attempt, but
      not in a row, leave it to boil for some time to maybe extract<br>
      <br>
      Any way, I go to https://drevlit.ru/egypt_dictionary_eng.html to
      see what is snake in egyptian, they pair hieroglyphs there, as
      mayans did. And I wonder if it's true, no, it's just their trick
      having not too much of a relation to reality, where 1,2,3
      hieroglyphs went drawn in a line, but never by two:<br>

      I wonder how authentic these texts are, because why would
      hieroglyphs looked different ways. Here's another one unreliable
      the same way (I think I read something about boustrophedonism of
      some egyptian texts, but look how lazy my research is, I don't go
      to check it, I leave it raw as drafts may allow, so I think that
      the previous and the following couple are modern collages)<br>

      Х said about А that he's a dark (or black) genius, and she wants a
      white one.<br>
      So is it good to cooperate with a black wizard? Blacks tend to
      lose, black is bad.<br>
      Black and bad are probably cognates, human (at least russian) mind
      sees black a s bad.<br>
      I believe all the world does, at least the best half of it. So
      let's turn into <font color="#cccccc">white </font>light wizards<br>
      We're heavy, we work at nights, to fully concentrate, we wouldn't
      sing in daylight, rockers who gig at sunlight are faking the funk
      so to say, they suck, maybe manson went down because of being
      burned by the sun. burnt out at the sun. He would never play on
      day light if not the money. some diamond wizards buy everyone.
      Love can trump diamonds. Because hearts are higher than diamonds
      in card games. It came to me some long time ago, who knows how
      legit this spades, clubs, diamonds, hearts. Spade is the грубая
      сила. Clubs are police, conspirators, gosudarstvo. Diamonds are
      bourgeoisie. Hearts are love.<br>
      God is love. How did I arrange them, I don't konw. But looks more
      slick than shudra, kshatri, vayshna, brahman. shudras work with
      spades (in russian it's пики. т.е. орки-урки здесь живут, надо их
      перевоспитывать. Их пытаются загнобить, типа потому что они
      выёбистые, но на самом деле у них гиперкомпенсация (им постоянно
      нужно доказывать себе (но как будто другим) что они не лохи) и
      восстановление их самоуважения - более разумная задача
      исправительных органов, которая скорее всего практикуется в
      скандинавии (но это не точно)<br>

      spades as water? because of the form of the sign <font

      <font color="#666666">♣</font> has, which is naturally three
      (four) balls laying at eachother. as if stones would. So clubs are
      solid. Thus shudra are shit (жидкие, жидкий народец было более
      общим понятием, которое осталось лишь как самой презренной нации
      чуть ли не топоним. Язык изменяем, и открыв эти
      неполиткореектности в языке мы можем их исправить или научиться у
      них. А зачем нам древние понятия, мы начнём переписывать геномы и
      национальность станет ещё более размытым понятием: allegence to
      the flag, obedience to the state, a rudiment from apes or
      reasonable strategy? Clubs are strong not only because they can
      come winning with a club against a knife. Club is a great weapon,
      because it can cause less open bleeding, so it's easier to control

      &nbsp;are rich people because vayshya and diamonds. And here I see
      that card deck and varnas have different opinions on whether
      vaishya higher or lower than kshatriyas. both are shudras from the
      pov of brahman, only vaishyas are rich shudras and kshatreys are
      key shudras. R &amp; K? Shudras are S pretty much qrs, pretty much
      all the linguals there are (t~s because ת without dot inside is
      read as th in thin) <br>
      Brahman is B, the labial. so is it k before r or after? q is
      before r, positionally yes, but chronologically r was before q,
      because q is not known to many alphabets, so first there were
      brahmans (shamans? shaman is shudra's brahkman? from the pov of
      the priests) and others were divided into rich and poor? no
      military among men, they're all military, and only later did good
      warriors unite against the others? How could it happen? When good
      fighter commited crime and peace in the city is not possible, the
      murderer would probably be expelled (execution is a paradox of
      murder for the murder: if murder is illegal why this one is? maybe
      that first murder was also justified not in less degree. Also good
      fighters saved lives, so it's also fair to forgive them for taking
      one? So expelled, and have to go the other city or to live in the
      woods, where he'd meet such good expelled warriors as them (did it
      became a law that they were to be killed not to let them be
      fighting for the city's enemies?) and gangs fought the cities and
      took control there and became the rulers, and the caste in itself.
      Kshatriyas are probably of this origin. So were rich people still
      higher than warriors? Rich people would hire warriors, to make
      them respectable. That's Europe. They can afford it. As a result,
      their economy is booming. boosted. (not doomed and busted) and
      poorfags of the east and south stand kshatriyas above vaishyas and
      as a result their countries don't know how to make money.<br>
      Brahmans of those countries should teach their societies to praise
      the rich, not higher-archers. The one who shoots further sits
      higher, because he is teh best for the best position.<br>
      Because brahman should rule with love, not fear. People should
      love success more than they fear death.<br>

      чудесных, волшебных камушков, семена колдовские объекты. Гроверы

      созревание семян, но практика показывает, что одна из лучших трав,
      которые я куривал была с хорошими зёрнами. Я трус, кстати, мне
      давали самые большие семена что я в жизни видел, я их проебал.
      Тупо проебал, может парочку друзьям подаривши, глупо, тупо,

      Just as B sounds as V in russian, so V sounds as B in spanish. Is
      it the letter we should use instead of б? but б reflects <i>д</i>
      and Б reflects Д in a way, so why would we miss it, especially
      since B is Б in english, so why would we differ? and if use V, use
      it as V, so transfer to latin where you can? ц = ts, ч = ch, ш =
      sh, щ = sch. Take brittish orthography and they will love us for
      them. It's a source of love that will cost us rien. Nothing, rien,

      I think I negleted armenian alphabet for too long. But it contains

      Ӏӏ is how some "russian" letter looks as if l is minuscule I,
      ctrlc+ctrlv those first two into google.<br>
      And it is russian only because of moscovite imperian polities, it
      is only used in some lanuages of Caucasus: <font size="+1">In the
        alphabets of Abaza, Adyghe, Avar, Dargwa, Ingush, Lak, Lezgian,
        and Tabassaran, it is a modifier letter which signals the
        preceding consonant as an ejective or aspirated consonant;[1]
        this letter has no phonetic value on its own. An exception is
        the Abkhaz language, which does not use the palochka for
        rendering aspiration, but instead uses the schwa (ә) as a
        modifier letter for labialization.<br>
        In Adyghe, the palochka is also a glottal stop /ʔ/.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example from Kabardian Adyghe dialect:
        елъэӏуащ [jaɬaˈʔʷaːɕ], "he asked her for something"<br>
        In Avar: кӏалъазе [kʼaˈɬaze], "to speak"<br>
        In Chechen, the palochka makes a preceding voiceless stop or
        affricate ejective, but also represents the voiced pharyngeal
        fricative /ʕ/ when it does not follow a voiceless stop or
        affricate. As an exception, in the digraph ⟨хӏ⟩, it produces the
        voiceless pharyngeal fricative /ħ/.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples
        from Chechen: йоӏ [joːʕ], "girl" and хӏорд [/ħoːrd/], "sea"</font><br>
      and who said these writing systems are inferior? I say: they're
      even further from aeiou-grace than russian, and I was taught they
      were made up by commies or right before them, they used to use
      arabis, and if they had their own national writing systems (they
      probably did: even africans and americans did)<br>
      And to discover those writing systems (out of earth or obscurity)
      is necessary, because we still don't know where the alphabetic
      structures were born and what stages it had is also very unclear
      to this day. I only speculate, but the furthest in the past I have
      looked was ogham, paleohispanic, cree. they are still hanging in
      air to this day. Ogham only a little resembles runes, but runes
      seem to be more complex way to write. Or is it ogham more
      abstracted, secret? Didn't it all come from hieroglyphs, because
      why would you go the other way or why would it be unrelated. I
      believe it all was born somewhere near yin-yang tai-chi. And from
      there it could sparkle fires of knowledge, of knowing good from
      bad, and oghamic ᚐ and ᚑ could be one way to look at it, ᛆ and ᚮ <font
        color="#cccccc">tells that b~a/l~o only l is before o and b</font><br>
      and B and L of ᚁ and ᚂ is how the same yin yang thing was
      reflected in consonants.<br>
      What is the third consonant differs: the modern transcription

      Z8_GND_5296 is found in 2013,<font color="#cccccc"> the year I
        made this discovery public. </font>And it's <font size="+1">among



        the oldest and most distant known galaxies at approximately 13.1
        billion light-years (4.0 Gpc) from Earth,</font> which is
      important, because they say that <font size="+1">Detailed
        measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big
        Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered
        the age of the universe.</font><br>
      so it's only a question of time until they reject that abrahamic
      misconception: some department clerks already invent props for
      their precious theory, but the smarter ones already question the
      previous props, all those dark things. The universe is infinite
      and indefinite. That is the only possibility by
      logico-philosophical reasons.<br>
      But they also say that the size of observable universe is 46.508
      billion light years. I wonder what they mean and if it's true, but
      that could be why they dare to say that universe expanded faster
      than light.<br>
      and here's explanation, they already prepared to the further
      perfection of telescopy with this mental gymnastics: <font
        size="+1">The word observable in this sense does not refer to
        the capability of modern technology to detect light or other
        information from an object, or whether there is anything to be
        detected. It refers to the physical limit created by the speed
        of light itself. Because no signals can travel faster than
        light, any object farther away from us than light could travel
        in the age of the universe (estimated as of 2015 around
        13.799±0.021 billion years[4]) simply cannot be detected, as the
        signals could not have reached us yet. Sometimes astrophysicists
        distinguish between the visible universe, which includes only
        signals emitted since recombination (when hydrogen atoms were
        formed from protons and electrons and photons were emitted)—and
        the observable universe, which includes signals since the
        beginning of the cosmological expansion (the Big Bang in
        traditional physical cosmology, the end of the inflationary
        epoch in modern cosmology).<br>
        According to calculations, the current comoving distance—proper
        distance, which takes into account that the universe has
        expanded since the light was emitted—to particles from which the
        cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) was emitted, which
        represents the radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0
        billion parsecs (about 45.7 billion light-years), while the
        comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is
        about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light-years),[11]
        about 2% larger. The radius of the observable universe is
        therefore estimated to be about 46.5 billion light-years[12][13]
        and its diameter about 28.5 gigaparsecs (93 billion light-years,
        or 8.8×1026 metres or 2.89×1027 feet), which equals 880
        yottametres.[14] The total mass of ordinary matter in the
        universe can be calculated using the critical density and the
        diameter of the observable universe to be about 1.5 × 1053
        kg.[15] In November 2018, astronomers reported that the
        extragalactic background light (EBL) amounted to 4 × 1084
        photons.[16][17]<br>
        As the universe's expansion is accelerating, all currently
        observable objects will eventually appear to freeze in time,
        while emitting progressively redder and fainter light. For
        instance, objects with the current redshift z from 5 to 10 will
        remain observable for no more than 4–6 billion years. In
        addition, light emitted by objects currently situated beyond a
        certain comoving distance (currently about 19 billion parsecs)
        will never reach Earth.[18] </font><br>
      so that is not the universe observable today, but якобы
      принципиально наблюдаемая, при том что это гонево на гоневе и
      гоневом погоняет<font color="#cccccc"> (предел наблюдения на
        теории большого взрыва ускоряющимся расширением</font><font
        color="#cccccc"><font color="#cccccc"> погоняет</font>)</font><br>
      and they are prudent, planted the seeds for further and infinite
      cope: <font size="+1">The size of the whole universe is unknown,
        and it might be infinite in extent.[19] Some parts of the
        universe are too far away for the light emitted since the Big
        Bang to have had enough time to reach Earth or space-based
        instruments, and therefore lie outside the observable universe.
        In the future, light from distant galaxies will have had more
        time to travel, so additional regions will become observable. </font><br>

      Jews can be antisemites because their parents are jews. Imagine if

      live like goyim and thus wouldn't be a subject to future

      what is s in english grammar? this letter can run by the sentence,
      and artist drawing the text can draw those lizards too, and thus
      `'s like י would appear and matres lectionis too. or is it a
      rational invention, those matres lectionis. Why would hebrew term
      have latin name?<br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">Matres lectionis (from Latin "mothers of reading",
        singular form: mater lectionis, from Hebrew: אֵם קְרִיאָה‎ ʾem
        kəriʾa) are consonants that are used to indicate a vowel,
        primarily in the writing down of Semitic languages such as
        Arabic, Hebrew and Syriac. The letters that do this in Hebrew
        are aleph א‎, he ה‎, waw ו‎ and yod י‎, and in Arabic, the
        matres lectionis (though they are much less often referred to
        thus) are ʾalif ا‎, wāw و‎ and yāʾ ي‎. The 'yod and waw in
        particular are more often vowels than they are consonants.<br>
        The original value of the matres lectionis corresponds closely
        to what is called in modern linguistics glides or semivowels.[1]
      </font><br>
      (this last line is to promote the misconception of consonant
      languages)<br>
      <font size="+1">Ма́трес лекцио́нис или «ма́тери чте́ния»[1][2]
        (лат. matres lectionis из ивр. ‏אִמֺּות הַקְּרִיאָה‏‎; ед. ч.
        mater lectionis) — в консонантном письме согласные буквы,
        используемые для обозначения долгих гласных звуков.<br>
        Из-за отсутствия гласных букв однозначное прочтение текста в
        консонантной системе письма зачастую бывает затруднено. Поэтому
        для обозначения гласных (преимущественно долгих) используются
        согласные буквы, обозначающие звуки со сходной артикуляцией:
        [w], [j], [h], [ʔ]. В иврите в этой роли используются следующие
        согласные: &lt;א&gt; алеф, &lt;ה&gt; хе, &lt;ו&gt; вав и
        &lt;י&gt; йуд.<br>
        Один из вариантов появления матрес лекционис, зафиксированный в
        иврите — стяжение дифтонгов [aw]→[oː] и [ay]→[eː], например в
        словах בית «дом» [bayt]→[bet], יום «день» [yawm]→[yom]. Затем
        буквы вав и йод, употребляемые в этих словах для обозначения
        согласного звука исчезнувшего дифтонга, были переосмыслены как
        обозначающие гласный звук, появившийся на его месте. После этого
        написание матрес лекционис распространилось на обозначение даже
        тех гласных, на месте которых никогда не было дифтонгов. Более
        того, при появлении систем огласовки матрес лекционис не исчезли
        из письма, а стали использоваться для обозначения гласных
        совместно с диакритическими знаками.<br>
        Матрес лекционис встречаются уже в угаритской, моавитской и
        финикийской письменностях, но широко применяются лишь в
        еврейском, арамейском, сирийском и арабском письме.<br>
        Позднее, в мандейском, авестийском и других алфавитах, а также в
        некоторых современных разновидностях арабского письма (напр.,
        алфавиты для курдского и новоуйгурского языков) и еврейского
        письма (алфавит для языка идиш) матрес лекционис регулярно
        обозначают все гласные, фактически превращаясь в гласные буквы.<br>
        Гласные буквы греческого и латинского письма, а также кириллицы
        исторически восходят к матрес лекционис: например, буква I
        произошла из согласной буквы, обозначавшей звук [j], U — из [w],
        А — из [ʔ], Е — из [h], О — из [ʕ]. </font><br>
      אֵם קְרִיאָה or אִמֺּות הַקְּרִיאָה‏‎?<br>

      how nations written with low letter can be offensive to those who
      consider themselves part of the nation: they got used to writing
      their nation with a capital letter (in english, but not in
      russian, russian nationalism is deminished by oppressive ruling

      This weird image cannot be found by neither yandex nor google, I
      think I have to contact that А. Куприятнов, but www.kuprphoto.ru
      doesn't work and web.archive.org tells he's Александр Куприянов
      and I find his email and phone number, I will use email to ask
      about where was this image made to learn more about this wonderful
      abecedary: if Т instead of Ӏ were a typo, they would fix it some
      long time ago, but it has some very deep and serious meaning: It
      is the final letter of that abecedary, and АӀ is not using Ӏ(І) as
      a ten, but as a stroke (only not above, but along it) Т is for Ten
      and for Тцать, <br>
      the difference between Ӏ and І is most probably caused by he mess
      in russian unicode, and not that they were actually in any way
      differet in the language. they are now.<br>

      </font>512 each, a good over 20000 hieroglyph set<br>
      <br>
      did you know 亖 is a legit hieroglyph for four? I love these
      unicode tables already. Just in case, once again, <a
        href="unicode.html">unicode</a>. unique code. <br>
      <br>
      I wonder why I cannot find neither ten, nor four in here, I was
      looking for ten, wanting to show how much that T of that clock
      looks like it. In yiddish ten is tsen, which is natural, they're
      related. in hebrew it's asher or something, faggots don't even
      transliterate hebrew in google. <br>
      十 is the T ten, it was in the third of those<strike><font
          color="#cccccc"> ~261-sign blocks. </font></strike>512 sign
      blocks<font color="#999999"> they are, I miscalculate the first
        time I know it because 512 is dual or binary number: 2<font
          size="+1"><sup>9</sup></font><br>
      </font><br>
      Those clock also have Ѳ looking like Ф and look at how Д reflects
      Б (which is not on the clock though, because Б is some later
      addition. And how Д reflects А on some other level.<br>
      Those clock (in comparison to the abc structure, tells that
      probably that Ѕ is actually ϛ which is reported to be labial,
      something like Ϝϝ as if ſ ~ f<br>
      <br>
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abecedarium tells:<br>
      <font size="+1">The alphabet used for monumental inscriptions was
        very different from the cursive. The uncial, occurring very
        rarely on sculptured monuments, and reserved for writing, did
        not appear until the 4th century. The majority of objects
        bearing the abecedaria are not of Christian origin, with the
        exception of two vases found at Carthage. These objects included
        tablets used by stone-cutters' apprentices while learning their
        trade. Stones have also been found in the catacombs, bearing the
        symbols A, B, C, etc. These are arranged, sometimes, in
        combinations which have puzzled scholars. One such stone, found
        in the cemetery of St. Alexander, in the Via Nomentana, is
        inscribed as follows:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; AXBVCTESDR . . . . . .BCCEECHI<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; EQGPH. . . .M MNOPQ<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; RSTVXYZ<br>
        <br>
        This can be compared with a denarius of L. Cassius Caecinianus,
        which has the following inscription:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AX, BV, CT, DS, ER, FQ, GP,
        HO, IN, LM<br>
        <br>
        Jerome explained this similarity. Children were made to learn
        the alphabet in pairs of letters, joining the first letter of
        the alphabet with the last letter (AX), the second letter with
        the second to last (BV), and so on. A stone found at Rome in
        1877, and dating from the 6th or 7th century, seems to have been
        used in a school, as a model for learning the alphabet, and
        points to the continuance of old methods of teaching. </font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      AX, BV, CT, DS, ER, FQ, GP, HO, IN, LM sets the sequence of
      ABCDEFGHILMNOPQRSTVX, and if T is I, then TVX is a quite
      alphabetic IVX. But what HILMN then? some insertion? was it AEO
      before?<br>
      <br>

        width="520" height="522">is what I found about AOE, and though
      it's probably read as ΑΘΕ as if for Ἀθηνᾶ, Ἀθήνη, Ἀσάνα but I
      suppose it something more magical: the oghamic order of 123 of
      AOE, where E is 3. whether because Θ is labial as Ѳ and thus Ο
      with a dot. and the lingual vowel Ε is a C with a dot? who knows,
      een though it doesn' look like that in this representation, it
      actually could be the third of ГFE, where Г is <i>g</i> is d is a
      and F is Ѳ is Θ is O.<br>
      And another example of that ΑΘΕ<br>

      With M the central letter between them.<br>

      is it the sequence? does this sequence of EF following the ΑΘΕ and
      then the next in line would start with Φ? We'll I looked for Φ
      coin, and see what I found:<br>

      and also this just in case, because it contains its own riddles:<br>

      This is definitely of some other period, with much finer sculpture
      and more straight text.<br>
      and a couple of something resembling letters can be seen at its
      obverse (avers in russian)<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">ob = об = о = a (de, thus d~b again)<br>

      But these could be more tokens than coins, the private money:
      whether half a horse (it would then take two coins to buy a horse)
      or an axe if the mint is of a forge. Is it where the word forgery
      comes?<br>
      Because look at these:<br>

      as if they were half a donkey or a jar or wine and chicken or a
      pie.<br>
      <br>
      And mysterious letters on coins are used and in much later
      periods:<br>
