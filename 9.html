        color="#cccccc"> this is a draft part, it may seem that I
        stumble around some random rhymes, but that's how I always was
        working and some cool stuff came out of it, so the most solid
        info is the first half of the first volume, all the rest is raw
        as odb loved it or more. several cool notes appeared afterwards,
        so I keep it online just in case and because ever wanted to read
        drafts of scientists.</font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Let's list the main points of this work so far:<br>
      <br>
      alphabetic order has some structures if lined out in planar tables<br>
      1. when it's cut into lines beginning with vowels.<br>
      2. when it's cut into lines which has vowels in centre of lines,
      and some vowelless lines are allwed if they are even only. But not
      all alphabets can be arranged like this, but some of them arrange
      into it nicely, so probably even less people knew about such
      arrangement.<br>
      3. reflection between the halves (or folds around some important
      letters)<br>
      4. reading of that first arrangement when the diagonal of
      reflection is lined from the top left corner into the right bottom
      one. <br>
      These four hypotheses are arranged by the rate of my belief in
      them. I'm pretty sure hypothesis number 1 is numero uno indeed,
      it's most probably a historic arrangement, I met few records of
      this structure, one from a modern-day amateur scientist, one from
      one english book, one from one indian book. I found that structure
      independently and it came frist or the second after the third.
      (hypothesis 2 came in the 3rd, and hypothesis 4 is the most recent
      one, it literally was born in the end of the previous volume)<br>
      <br>
      Also transcription of ancient texts cannot be trusted 100% as all
      the science have reflected on itself and discovered a replication
      crises, of which I think I was aware of, because I knew I had to
      do it from scratch, but I was motivated by some linguistic forum
      to dig further in the past to be taken more seriously, so I
      followed that ruiling.<br>
      <br>
      Christian claims that it's them invented all those writing systems
      are false. <br>
      <br>
      Also some open threads to ancient egyptian, music theory, both
      iberias, chinese, native american, african and polynesian writing
      systems, some mystical and mythological references, leading to
      whole that culture to find relating pieces and gesture language
      can be a source of theorizings, and there are probably more, ogham
      of course.<br>
      <br>
      These claims are up to you to find out how credible am I, I think
      I trust them pretty well.<br>
      (I lay out the argumentations for them in the previous volume.
      here my task is to go further, and I think a good and perspective
      source for research is the short words of some old european
      language such as latin in relation to modern european languages
      and how the same short pieces relate in them.<br>
      <br>
      a = 1, to,&nbsp; well I didn't expect the reference to 1 2, but
      here it is. a is but in russian, which also follows a. <br>
      of об <br>
      в was v in russian and б was where ё is now?<br>
      <br>
      de оf <br>
      до to<br>
      <br>
      is есть - why does modal word has the to in russian?<br>
      <br>
      am ем <br>
      <br>
      are&nbsp; ести<br>
      <br>
      are am is as AMS<br>
      Вы Я Он<br>
      В could be the b, the prehistorically first letter.<br>
      I as the centre between A &amp; V.<br>
      N of он is the final letter of its' line, and could be lmn the xyz
      of the past? <br>
      also N is ν<br>
      <br>
      VIN? ni = мы? я тоже последняя. V was the last and that's W of we.<br>
      VJN? and Он as the alphabetic sequence is <br>
      <br>
      чем могут быть алфавитные слова как не следом более древней
      системы? и слово ёж предстало как базовым как еда, и представить,
      что люди начинали звероловство с поедания ежей можно представить
      очень даже: в еже мяса как раз на раз, другие звери их скорей
      всего не умели ловить а человек знал, что можно тупо камнем убить
      его. ежи кусаются, так что да, руками ловить погано. Возможно, мы
      делали себе одежду из шкурок ежа. Любопытно было бы посмотреть.<br>
      Но скорей всего эта дрянь колкая, так что наверное нет. Может на
      щит разве что прибивали как оружие, но тоже своих же поколишь
      некстати. так что наверное нет. еж еда и только.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      A guy contacted me about his app and I thought that he will be
      more interested in some other research:<br>
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Znx-odtXgw8 (Global Alphabet by
      Yuliana Gorokhov)<br>
      and though I first thought it was purely an artistic project,
      watching it now I see that she speaks of historical unity of all
      those alphabets. And it makes her work much more interesting, and
      she even removes the first stroke of Л the way it obviously is a
      swash when you compare cursive Л and l.<br>
      <font color="#999999">but then I watch further and I notice that
        she doesn't reconstruct the prehistoric unity, but turns it into
        truly an artistic project, which makes it less interesting for
        me, but the latin-arabic font is cool)</font><br>
      <br>
      And when I searched for it, alphabet ted, I found an african
      professor speaking of ancient arabic writing systems, and here's a
      tidbit:<br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbIewxHQrk"><img
          src="9_files/vai.png" alt="" border="0" width="1227"
          height="768"></a><br>
      <br>
      and there he recommends his book, which also contains many sources
      for research:<br>
      <br>

      <font color="#cccccc">(I link it to a pirated version of his book,
        it also cannot into ctrlF, so it's a demo version, for all of
        you to see how beautiful is this book, of what perfect quality
        is its pictures. It seems old russian or european equipment was
        sent to africa and preserved there pretty well. Pirates do break
        some unjust laws, and I justify that because I give them free
        promotion, either way how am I less worthy than librusec where I
        found it. Sharing is caring. Pirating boosts sales because it
        promotes) I would mirror, but it's too big.</font><br>
      I selected this one image, because it can indicate how muslim
      missionaries also lied about their inventions, That time people
      knew of much more useful writing systems, why would they use
      african system a little, but not completely, why does it go
      labials first if modern scholars didn't know that? Why would it be
      named ki ka ku as if it has som other, the eastern order and only
      three vowels. And notice that signs with a i u go syllabricly with
      diacritic over the same sign, and other syllables are off this
      structure, completely arbitrary. So maybe that guy did invent it,
      adding his silly additional syllables to the ones used before him.
      to the original Ki Ka Ku. KKK is some psy-op, so it seems, it
      could hit africans with godly awe via these synapses, no wonder
      they were scared. It was a psy-op, a terrorizing.<br>

      but ы is the opposite of я in this claster.<br>
      <br>
      la is modified ы, ы is some abstract vowel, and probably that's
      how they sang before they learned to merge vowels with consonants
      into syllables. <br>

      ы are both of i-claster, unless у is y and я is а. are ы and я
      both y's and that's how it splits from where it splits into u and
      i (both can be a, because of bus and i's name's ai)<br>

      <font size="+1">Пуруша (др.-инд. पुरुष, puruṣa IAST, «человек,
        мужчина, дух») — согласно индуистской мифологии, существо, из
        тела которого была создана Вселенная.<br>
        <br>
        В Ригведе жертвоприношению Пуруши посвящён отдельный гимн —
        Пуруша-сукта. Пуруша — Наслаждающийся — четырнадцатое из 1000
        имён Вишну.<br>
        <br>
        В индийской философии термин «пуруша» означает «божественный
        дух», макрокосм. В философии санкхьи пуруша — множественное
        неподвижное мужское (духовное) космическое начало, «чистое
        сознание», созерцающее динамичное женское начало — пракрити
        (материя). Пуруши являются вечными, их основные свойства —
        отсутствие свойств (ниргуна). Однако Пуруша, созерцающий
        пракрити, склонен ошибочно идентифицировать себя с ней и с
        гунами.<br>
        <br>
        В первоначальном учении присутствовал тезис о множественности
        пуруш (пуруша-бахутвам), тогда как в позднейших трактатах
        провозглашался уже принцип единого пуруши, наделяемого
        качествами, близкими к атрибутам атмана Упанишад. </font><br>

      The word renown shows that k in known is a prefix. Probably, the
      same as in russian к which is to.<br>
      and then now is probably now and n is a suffix of the past or done
      as in done and gone.<br>

          width="355" height="594"></a><br>
      here A regains its beak as if it simply rotated its head or maybe
      itself in the form of A and with swash it rotates its head to its
      right.<br>
      Swash of G makes <i>g</i> even closer to d (both meet again in <i>g</i>
      being russian d)<br>
      And it gives us ABᚦ EFG <br>
      and next H is a form of I, a double I, and swashed form of J shows
      that it's half a I, a י (is it why they thought hebrew didn't have
      vowels? Because I was shorter than theirs? Then such tendency
      existed? Arabs spoke their semitic language at least a millenium
      longer and they have ה which is vowel in half of hebrew examples
      is completely consonant in arabic ه also why o is in the e-line?
      is efg actually opq?<br>

      Why is it here? Is it the decline? I'm highe for some many lines
      and many good ideas, such as:<br>
      snake lion snail as LNV lion is l, not n. snake is s, thus samekh?
      snail is literally snl. I wander in open space now, it's not much
      to do with anything, too far too soon. Attempt after attempt, but
      not in a row, leave it to boil for some time to maybe extract<br>
      <br>
      Any way, I go to https://drevlit.ru/egypt_dictionary_eng.html to
      see what is snake in egyptian, they pair hieroglyphs there, as
      mayans did. And I wonder if it's true, no, it's just their trick
      having not too much of a relation to reality, where 1,2,3
      hieroglyphs went drawn in a line, but never by two:<br>

      I wonder how authentic these texts are, because why would
      hieroglyphs looked different ways. Here's another one unreliable
      the same way (I think I read something about boustrophedonism of
      some egyptian texts, but look how lazy my research is, I don't go
      to check it, I leave it raw as drafts may allow, so I think that
      the previous and the following couple are modern collages)<br>

      Х said about А that he's a dark (or black) genius, and she wants a
      white one.<br>
      So is it good to cooperate with a black wizard? Blacks tend to
      lose, black is bad.<br>
      Black and bad are probably cognates, human (at least russian) mind
      sees black a s bad.<br>
      I believe all the world does, at least the best half of it. So
      let's turn into <font color="#cccccc">white </font>light wizards<br>
      We're heavy, we work at nights, to fully concentrate, we wouldn't
      sing in daylight, rockers who gig at sunlight are faking the funk
      so to say, they suck, maybe manson went down because of being
      burned by the sun. burnt out at the sun. He would never play on
      day light if not the money. some diamond wizards buy everyone.
      Love can trump diamonds. Because hearts are higher than diamonds
      in card games. It came to me some long time ago, who knows how
      legit this spades, clubs, diamonds, hearts. Spade is the грубая
      сила. Clubs are police, conspirators, gosudarstvo. Diamonds are
      bourgeoisie. Hearts are love.<br>
      God is love. How did I arrange them, I don't konw. But looks more
      slick than shudra, kshatri, vayshna, brahman. shudras work with
      spades (in russian it's пики. т.е. орки-урки здесь живут, надо их
      перевоспитывать. Их пытаются загнобить, типа потому что они
      выёбистые, но на самом деле у них гиперкомпенсация (им постоянно
      нужно доказывать себе (но как будто другим) что они не лохи) и
      восстановление их самоуважения - более разумная задача
      исправительных органов, которая скорее всего практикуется в
      скандинавии (но это не точно)<br>

      spades as water? because of the form of the sign <font

      <font color="#666666">♣</font> has, which is naturally three
      (four) balls laying at eachother. as if stones would. So clubs are
      solid. Thus shudra are shit (жидкие, жидкий народец было более
      общим понятием, которое осталось лишь как самой презренной нации
      чуть ли не топоним. Язык изменяем, и открыв эти
      неполиткореектности в языке мы можем их исправить или научиться у
      них. А зачем нам древние понятия, мы начнём переписывать геномы и
      национальность станет ещё более размытым понятием: allegence to
      the flag, obedience to the state, a rudiment from apes or
      reasonable strategy? Clubs are strong not only because they can
      come winning with a club against a knife. Club is a great weapon,
      because it can cause less open bleeding, so it's easier to control

      &nbsp;are rich people because vayshya and diamonds. And here I see
      that card deck and varnas have different opinions on whether
      vaishya higher or lower than kshatriyas. both are shudras from the
      pov of brahman, only vaishyas are rich shudras and kshatreys are
      key shudras. R &amp; K? Shudras are S pretty much qrs, pretty much
      all the linguals there are (t~s because ת without dot inside is
      read as th in thin) <br>
      Brahman is B, the labial. so is it k before r or after? q is
      before r, positionally yes, but chronologically r was before q,
      because q is not known to many alphabets, so first there were
      brahmans (shamans? shaman is shudra's brahkman? from the pov of
      the priests) and others were divided into rich and poor? no
      military among men, they're all military, and only later did good
      warriors unite against the others? How could it happen? When good
      fighter commited crime and peace in the city is not possible, the
      murderer would probably be expelled (execution is a paradox of
      murder for the murder: if murder is illegal why this one is? maybe
      that first murder was also justified not in less degree. Also good
      fighters saved lives, so it's also fair to forgive them for taking
      one? So expelled, and have to go the other city or to live in the
      woods, where he'd meet such good expelled warriors as them (did it
      became a law that they were to be killed not to let them be
      fighting for the city's enemies?) and gangs fought the cities and
      took control there and became the rulers, and the caste in itself.
      Kshatriyas are probably of this origin. So were rich people still
      higher than warriors? Rich people would hire warriors, to make
      them respectable. That's Europe. They can afford it. As a result,
      their economy is booming. boosted. (not doomed and busted) and
      poorfags of the east and south stand kshatriyas above vaishyas and
      as a result their countries don't know how to make money.<br>
      Brahmans of those countries should teach their societies to praise
      the rich, not higher-archers. The one who shoots further sits
      higher, because he is teh best for the best position.<br>
      Because brahman should rule with love, not fear. People should
      love success more than they fear death.<br>

      чудесных, волшебных камушков, семена колдовские объекты. Гроверы

      созревание семян, но практика показывает, что одна из лучших трав,
      которые я куривал была с хорошими зёрнами. Я трус, кстати, мне
      давали самые большие семена что я в жизни видел, я их проебал.
      Тупо проебал, может парочку друзьям подаривши, глупо, тупо,

      Just as B sounds as V in russian, so V sounds as B in spanish. Is
      it the letter we should use instead of б? but б reflects <i>д</i>
      and Б reflects Д in a way, so why would we miss it, especially
      since B is Б in english, so why would we differ? and if use V, use
      it as V, so transfer to latin where you can? ц = ts, ч = ch, ш =
      sh, щ = sch. Take brittish orthography and they will love us for
      them. It's a source of love that will cost us rien. Nothing, rien,

      Ӏӏ is how some "russian" letter looks as if l is minuscule I,
      ctrlc+ctrlv those first two into google.<br>
      And it is russian only because of moscovite imperian polities, it
      is only used in some lanuages of Caucasus: <font size="+1">In the
        alphabets of Abaza, Adyghe, Avar, Dargwa, Ingush, Lak, Lezgian,
        and Tabassaran, it is a modifier letter which signals the
        preceding consonant as an ejective or aspirated consonant;[1]
        this letter has no phonetic value on its own. An exception is
        the Abkhaz language, which does not use the palochka for
        rendering aspiration, but instead uses the schwa (ә) as a
        modifier letter for labialization.<br>
        In Adyghe, the palochka is also a glottal stop /ʔ/.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example from Kabardian Adyghe dialect:
        елъэӏуащ [jaɬaˈʔʷaːɕ], "he asked her for something"<br>
        In Avar: кӏалъазе [kʼaˈɬaze], "to speak"<br>
        In Chechen, the palochka makes a preceding voiceless stop or
        affricate ejective, but also represents the voiced pharyngeal
        fricative /ʕ/ when it does not follow a voiceless stop or
        affricate. As an exception, in the digraph ⟨хӏ⟩, it produces the
        voiceless pharyngeal fricative /ħ/.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples
        from Chechen: йоӏ [joːʕ], "girl" and хӏорд [/ħoːrd/], "sea"</font><br>
      and who said these writing systems are inferior? I say: they're
      even further from aeiou-grace than russian, and I was taught they
      were made up by commies or right before them, they used to use
      arabis, and if they had their own national writing systems (they
      probably did: even africans and americans did)<br>
      And to discover those writing systems (out of earth or obscurity)
      is necessary, because we still don't know where the alphabetic
      structures were born and what stages it had is also very unclear
      to this day. I only speculate, but the furthest in the past I have
      looked was ogham, paleohispanic, cree. they are still hanging in
      air to this day. Ogham only a little resembles runes, but runes
      seem to be more complex way to write. Or is it ogham more
      abstracted, secret? Didn't it all come from hieroglyphs, because
      why would you go the other way or why would it be unrelated. I
      believe it all was born somewhere near yin-yang tai-chi. And from
      there it could sparkle fires of knowledge, of knowing good from
      bad, and oghamic ᚐ and ᚑ could be one way to look at it, ᛆ and ᚮ <font
        color="#cccccc">tells that b~a/l~o only l is before o and b</font><br>
      and B and L of ᚁ and ᚂ is how the same yin yang thing was
      reflected in consonants.<br>
      What is the third consonant differs: the modern transcription
      denotes ᚃ to be F (or W), but the name of the system is
      Beit-Luis-Nion. and Nion is ᚅ&nbsp; today. It's as if F(W) and
      S(ᚄ) was inserted in the middle of it later. f and ſ. as in false.<br>
      the opposite of t of true and j of joy the s of sorrow and f of
      fake and flawed and false and fallen and... fallen as an apple
      from a tree, beaten and will rot because of this.<br>
      <br>
      F(W) being the third (if B is the first!) correlates to alphabetic
      F(ו) and tells that whether BLF are the consonants without vowels,
      and L is Г as λ is ג. Then S is alike to russian Ѕ and N is the M
      claster..<br>
      Or.. BLN is the order and it's MLN. and samekh maybe follows. and
      W is the ω<br>
      and it supports the idea that bcde is the order existing before
      abcd.<br>
      And the name beit-luis-nion tells that there was neither samekh
      nor "e", that bcd is all the order of the consonants. aiu or ao?
      whatever is vowel order, consonant syllabic order is bcd. and that
      chart went extended to pqrst, for example because sometimes there
      were more than three vowels. What do vowels have to do with it?
      Before bcd order it was ᛒᚦ (the thing making me tell that runes
      probably predate normal alphabets. this and the more rich culture
      over their use: not only the myth of their creation, but also
      binden runes, staveless runes, divinations, trees, etc. and also
      that semites are deceitful, even though it's not polite to say so,
      it (I honestly admit it) was a fact<font color="#999999">or</font>

      <br>
      aoi is blue and this is vowel order of ogham <br>
      akai is red and could stand for alphabetic order, or should I call
      the eastern canon syllabaric instead?<br>
      even devanagari can be seen as syllabary if we consider the
      vowelled consonants syllables no matter how unicode draws it (I
      don't know how it does it) because korean is alphabetic, but
      unicode definitely gives them in syllables, and they have as many
      of those as chinese do, and they look similar, which if I didn't
      know the<font color="#cccccc">ir histroy </font>history, I would
      recognize it as a link between chinese writing system and the
      syllabaries of the region. Lets entertain this possibility, let's

      Z8_GND_5296 is found in 2013,<font color="#cccccc"> the year I
        made this discovery public. </font>And it's <font size="+1">among




















        the oldest and most distant known galaxies at approximately 13.1
        billion light-years (4.0 Gpc) from Earth,</font> which is
      important, because they say that <font size="+1">Detailed
        measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big
        Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered
        the age of the universe.</font><br>
      so it's only a question of time until they reject that abrahamic
      misconception: some department clerks already invent props for
      their precious theory, but the smarter ones already question the
      previous props, all those dark things. The universe is infinite
      and indefinite. That is the only possibility by
      logico-philosophical reasons.<br>
      But they also say that the size of observable universe is 46.508
      billion light years. I wonder what they mean and if it's true, but
      that could be why they dare to say that universe expanded faster
      than light.<br>
      and here's explanation, they already prepared to the further
      perfection of telescopy with this mental gymnastics: <font
        size="+1">The word observable in this sense does not refer to
        the capability of modern technology to detect light or other
        information from an object, or whether there is anything to be
        detected. It refers to the physical limit created by the speed
        of light itself. Because no signals can travel faster than
        light, any object farther away from us than light could travel
        in the age of the universe (estimated as of 2015 around
        13.799±0.021 billion years[4]) simply cannot be detected, as the
        signals could not have reached us yet. Sometimes astrophysicists
        distinguish between the visible universe, which includes only
        signals emitted since recombination (when hydrogen atoms were
        formed from protons and electrons and photons were emitted)—and
        the observable universe, which includes signals since the
        beginning of the cosmological expansion (the Big Bang in
        traditional physical cosmology, the end of the inflationary
        epoch in modern cosmology).<br>
        According to calculations, the current comoving distance—proper
        distance, which takes into account that the universe has
        expanded since the light was emitted—to particles from which the
        cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) was emitted, which
        represents the radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0
        billion parsecs (about 45.7 billion light-years), while the
        comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is
        about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light-years),[11]
        about 2% larger. The radius of the observable universe is
        therefore estimated to be about 46.5 billion light-years[12][13]
        and its diameter about 28.5 gigaparsecs (93 billion light-years,
        or 8.8×1026 metres or 2.89×1027 feet), which equals 880
        yottametres.[14] The total mass of ordinary matter in the
        universe can be calculated using the critical density and the
        diameter of the observable universe to be about 1.5 × 1053
        kg.[15] In November 2018, astronomers reported that the
        extragalactic background light (EBL) amounted to 4 × 1084
        photons.[16][17]<br>
        As the universe's expansion is accelerating, all currently
        observable objects will eventually appear to freeze in time,
        while emitting progressively redder and fainter light. For
        instance, objects with the current redshift z from 5 to 10 will
        remain observable for no more than 4–6 billion years. In
        addition, light emitted by objects currently situated beyond a
        certain comoving distance (currently about 19 billion parsecs)
        will never reach Earth.[18] </font><br>
      so that is not the universe observable today, but якобы
      принципиально наблюдаемая, при том что это гонево на гоневе и
      гоневом погоняет<font color="#cccccc"> (предел наблюдения на
        теории большого взрыва ускоряющимся расширением</font><font
        color="#cccccc"><font color="#cccccc"> погоняет</font>)</font><br>
      and they are prudent, planted the seeds for further and infinite
      cope: <font size="+1">The size of the whole universe is unknown,
        and it might be infinite in extent.[19] Some parts of the
        universe are too far away for the light emitted since the Big
        Bang to have had enough time to reach Earth or space-based
        instruments, and therefore lie outside the observable universe.
        In the future, light from distant galaxies will have had more
        time to travel, so additional regions will become observable. </font><br>

      Jews can be antisemites because their parents are jews. Imagine if

      live like goyim and thus wouldn't be a subject to future

      what is s in english grammar? this letter can run by the sentence,
      and artist drawing the text can draw those lizards too, and thus
      `'s like י would appear and matres lectionis too. or is it a
      rational invention, those matres lectionis. Why would hebrew term
      have latin name?<br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">Matres lectionis (from Latin "mothers of reading",
        singular form: mater lectionis, from Hebrew: אֵם קְרִיאָה‎ ʾem
        kəriʾa) are consonants that are used to indicate a vowel,
        primarily in the writing down of Semitic languages such as
        Arabic, Hebrew and Syriac. The letters that do this in Hebrew
        are aleph א‎, he ה‎, waw ו‎ and yod י‎, and in Arabic, the
        matres lectionis (though they are much less often referred to
        thus) are ʾalif ا‎, wāw و‎ and yāʾ ي‎. The 'yod and waw in
        particular are more often vowels than they are consonants.<br>
        The original value of the matres lectionis corresponds closely
        to what is called in modern linguistics glides or semivowels.[1]
      </font><br>
      (this last line is to promote the misconception of consonant
      languages)<br>
      <font size="+1">Ма́трес лекцио́нис или «ма́тери чте́ния»[1][2]
        (лат. matres lectionis из ивр. ‏אִמֺּות הַקְּרִיאָה‏‎; ед. ч.
        mater lectionis) — в консонантном письме согласные буквы,
        используемые для обозначения долгих гласных звуков.<br>
        Из-за отсутствия гласных букв однозначное прочтение текста в
        консонантной системе письма зачастую бывает затруднено. Поэтому
        для обозначения гласных (преимущественно долгих) используются
        согласные буквы, обозначающие звуки со сходной артикуляцией:
        [w], [j], [h], [ʔ]. В иврите в этой роли используются следующие
        согласные: &lt;א&gt; алеф, &lt;ה&gt; хе, &lt;ו&gt; вав и
        &lt;י&gt; йуд.<br>
        Один из вариантов появления матрес лекционис, зафиксированный в
        иврите — стяжение дифтонгов [aw]→[oː] и [ay]→[eː], например в
        словах בית «дом» [bayt]→[bet], יום «день» [yawm]→[yom]. Затем
        буквы вав и йод, употребляемые в этих словах для обозначения
        согласного звука исчезнувшего дифтонга, были переосмыслены как
        обозначающие гласный звук, появившийся на его месте. После этого
        написание матрес лекционис распространилось на обозначение даже
        тех гласных, на месте которых никогда не было дифтонгов. Более
        того, при появлении систем огласовки матрес лекционис не исчезли
        из письма, а стали использоваться для обозначения гласных
        совместно с диакритическими знаками.<br>
        Матрес лекционис встречаются уже в угаритской, моавитской и
        финикийской письменностях, но широко применяются лишь в
        еврейском, арамейском, сирийском и арабском письме.<br>
        Позднее, в мандейском, авестийском и других алфавитах, а также в
        некоторых современных разновидностях арабского письма (напр.,
        алфавиты для курдского и новоуйгурского языков) и еврейского
        письма (алфавит для языка идиш) матрес лекционис регулярно
        обозначают все гласные, фактически превращаясь в гласные буквы.<br>
        Гласные буквы греческого и латинского письма, а также кириллицы
        исторически восходят к матрес лекционис: например, буква I
        произошла из согласной буквы, обозначавшей звук [j], U — из [w],
        А — из [ʔ], Е — из [h], О — из [ʕ]. </font><br>
      אֵם קְרִיאָה or אִמֺּות הַקְּרִיאָה‏‎?<br>

      how nations written with low letter can be offensive to those who
      consider themselves part of the nation: they got used to writing
      their nation with a capital letter (in english, but not in
      russian, russian nationalism is deminished by oppressive ruling

      This weird image cannot be found by neither yandex nor google, I
      think I have to contact that А. Куприятнов, but www.kuprphoto.ru
      doesn't work and web.archive.org tells he's Александр Куприянов
      and I find his email and phone number, I will use email to ask
      about where was this image made to learn more about this wonderful
      abecedary: if Т instead of Ӏ were a typo, they would fix it some
      long time ago, but it has some very deep and serious meaning: It
      is the final letter of that abecedary, and АӀ is not using Ӏ(І) as
      a ten, but as a stroke (only not above, but along it) Т is for Ten
      and for Тцать, <br>
      the difference between Ӏ and І is most probably caused by he mess
      in russian unicode, and not that they were actually in any way
      differet in the language. they are now.<br>

      </font>512 each, a good over 20000 hieroglyph set<br>
      <br>
      did you know 亖 is a legit hieroglyph for four? I love these
      unicode tables already. Just in case, once again, <a
        href="unicode.html">unicode</a>. unique code. <br>
      <br>
      I wonder why I cannot find neither ten, nor four in here, I was
      looking for ten, wanting to show how much that T of that clock
      looks like it. In yiddish ten is tsen, which is natural, they're
      related. in hebrew it's asher or something, faggots don't even
      transliterate hebrew in google. <br>
      十 is the T ten, it was in the third of those<strike><font
          color="#cccccc"> ~261-sign blocks. </font></strike>512 sign
      blocks<font color="#999999"> they are, I miscalculate the first
        time I know it because 512 is dual or binary number: 2<font
          size="+1"><sup>9</sup></font><br>
      </font><br>
      Those clock also have Ѳ looking like Ф and look at how Д reflects
      Б (which is not on the clock though, because Б is some later
      addition. And how Д reflects А on some other level.<br>
      Those clock (in comparison to the abc structure, tells that
      probably that Ѕ is actually ϛ which is reported to be labial,
      something like Ϝϝ as if ſ ~ f<br>
      <br>
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abecedarium tells:<br>
      <font size="+1">The alphabet used for monumental inscriptions was
        very different from the cursive. The uncial, occurring very
        rarely on sculptured monuments, and reserved for writing, did
        not appear until the 4th century. The majority of objects
        bearing the abecedaria are not of Christian origin, with the
        exception of two vases found at Carthage. These objects included
        tablets used by stone-cutters' apprentices while learning their
        trade. Stones have also been found in the catacombs, bearing the
        symbols A, B, C, etc. These are arranged, sometimes, in
        combinations which have puzzled scholars. One such stone, found
        in the cemetery of St. Alexander, in the Via Nomentana, is
        inscribed as follows:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; AXBVCTESDR . . . . . .BCCEECHI<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; EQGPH. . . .M MNOPQ<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; RSTVXYZ<br>
        <br>
        This can be compared with a denarius of L. Cassius Caecinianus,
        which has the following inscription:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AX, BV, CT, DS, ER, FQ, GP,
        HO, IN, LM<br>
        <br>
        Jerome explained this similarity. Children were made to learn
        the alphabet in pairs of letters, joining the first letter of
        the alphabet with the last letter (AX), the second letter with
        the second to last (BV), and so on. A stone found at Rome in
        1877, and dating from the 6th or 7th century, seems to have been
        used in a school, as a model for learning the alphabet, and
        points to the continuance of old methods of teaching. </font><br>

      <br>
      AX, BV, CT, DS, ER, FQ, GP, HO, IN, LM sets the sequence of
      ABCDEFGHILMNOPQRSTVX, and if T is I, then TVX is a quite
      alphabetic IVX. But what HILMN then? some insertion? was it AEO
      before?<br>
      <br>

        width="520" height="522">is what I found about AOE, and though
      it's probably read as ΑΘΕ as if for Ἀθηνᾶ, Ἀθήνη, Ἀσάνα but I
      suppose it something more magical: the oghamic order of 123 of
      AOE, where E is 3. whether because Θ is labial as Ѳ and thus Ο
      with a dot. and the lingual vowel Ε is a C with a dot? who knows,
      een though it doesn' look like that in this representation, it
      actually could be the third of ГFE, where Г is <i>g</i> is d is a
      and F is Ѳ is Θ is O.<br>
      And another example of that ΑΘΕ<br>

      is it the sequence? does this sequence of EF following the ΑΘΕ and
      then the next in line would start with Φ? We'll I looked for Φ

      This is definitely of some other period, with much finer sculpture

      But these could be more tokens than coins, the private money:
      whether half a horse (it would then take two coins to buy a horse)
      or an axe if the mint is of a forge. Is it where the word forgery
      comes?<br>
      Because look at these:<br>

      as if they were half a donkey or a jar or wine and chicken or a

      ??? (forgot why) - here had to be the first example which made me
      think that p ~ st, but once I actually woke up it went away, and
      it still can be regained once ai compares all words with p to the
      same words with st instead of p. And ai part is needed to compare
      the synonymicity, the pairing can be in a prepairing part by a
      simple algorhythm with set freedoms (so it coulg change i to e, as
      in stick peg) and then we compare what phonetic pairs make the
      most of the words and we calculate the proportion of those pairs
      to the frequency of those letters in general vocabulary and then
      we place these relations along the normal distribution, and we see
      the anomalies, and those anomalies will be the real things, but
      for now let's entertain this idea by hand:<br>
      P~ST<br>
      Pater ~ St.Ater ~ С-т.Отец<br>
      ᛋᛏ~ᚢ<br>
      part start<br>
      stop pop<br>
      stay pay<br>
      steal peal<br>
      pink (pig) stink<br>
      stick peg<br>
      right: straight~право (as if gh is f, literally digamma, and then
      h is a form of g, both can be transliterated into russian with г)<br>
      f could be st because f~p? then st ~ gh, all four are gammas? abc
      (c &amp; d are both gammas too them)<br>
      funk stunk? meh..<br>

      Yesterday, compiling the second box of aeiou songs, I thought that
      I should try ΑΕΗΙΟΥΩ because that's the orderd Demetrius from
      Alexandria spoke about.<br>
      and the first find is magical: <font size="-1">https://sci-hub.do/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00397672808590203?journalCode=sosl20#</font>
      (<a href="mirrors/amundsen1928.pdf"><font color="#000000">mirror</font></a>)<br>
      (that is literally the first actual spell I see since I began this
      work: We were told to translate a spellic at our grammar lessons
      at uni (like Tesla I attended it, but dropped in few years, I was
      better than that)<br>
      And now it actually spells, and I think I know how to spell those
      vowels: the way russiand would spell them: a e i o u, the way they
      are in bar pen pit rock pull, the universal way to recognize them,
      ei i ai ow ju are some local meme, which probably was force-memed
      because that vowel thing worked, so they had to make sure people
      didn't read them properly. Or maybe eiaou is the actual gammut.
      But as that gammut is reported to be descending, <br>
      I would suspect it to be even further that way: ieaou. I for 1 and
      V for 5.<br>
      And some of those greek vowels are the same: <font size="+1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg5h-QMDnUI</font>

          color="#000000">mirror</font></a>)<br>
      (if that reading is correct, with all those pletora of vowels they
      still don't have u (they probably get it by some dyphthong, even
      though it is not a dyphthong) which speaks towards the fact that u
      is the later vowel, that it was f before when f was w. but why
      does ע looks so much like У? but thus it also looks like y, and
      also لا but cursive ע looks almost exactly like ꙋ <br>

      Alaska: when merging happens, we'll unite with alaska, especially
      the ingenious people living at the border will be happy: now they
      have to fly from kamchatka to vladivostok to fly to alaska from
      there and then to return to another side of the border to meet
      relatives from the neighbouring vilage. And the fact that Moscow
      will now be american city should not bother moscovites, because
      Tokyo didn't become worse once americans took control over Japan.
      Or who knows how traditional japanese thought about it (me
      personally I automatically wrote better instead of worse, maybe
      because I use better much more often than worse, or because my

      I will bring them all here:<br>

      and that link is so huge, it gave me other pieces: Abhisheka is a
      rather alphabetic word, and it does have a magical meaning. Which
      is not so wonderful, since I researched magic when I got more
      magic, but nevertheless, it's one of ours now. And it's wiki tells
      me that those idols are named murti, whether they are male or
      female.<br>
      2. downloading books on magic from libgen.rs I wonder if spell is
      the opposite of bless.<br>
      (I went downloading them looking for that oslo ostracon, you can
      do so yourself, I don't mirror them)<br>
      also is culture mispronounced conjure?<br>
      That oslo ostracon was directly mentioned in<font size="+1"> (New
        Texts from Ancient Cultures) Andrew T. Wilburn - Materia Magica_
        The Archaeology of Magic in Roman Egypt, Cyprus, and
        Spain-University of Michigan Press (2013) </font>and<font
        size="+1"> John G. Gager - Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from
        the Ancient World (1999) </font>and after all those curse books
      I wanted to download something to outbalance that just in case, so
      I have downloaded about 36 books on blessings of all sorts.<br>
      3. okay, those 5 pages of links seem not too much to breathe
      through, but those are about 50 links, so I'd better slow down to
      surf through them more осмысленно. I will close this cound for
      now, I will return to this branch, that's later. 50 (actually only
      21) only in videos, there are who knows how much more in general.
      I will stick to videos and images only in my quest this time. and
      there are not that many images, only some abraxis stuff. Which is
      weird and actually may indicate that ΑΕΗΙΟΥΩ is some local meme,
      and AEIOU is the universal formula. Discredited by being childish,
      but that's actually basic, deep, real, and all the mystic
      literature is mistaken by some inquisition<font color="#cccccc">ing</font>
      will. but then I ignore abraxis (because I don't understand what
      it is, even though the word is alphabetic) and see at directly
      alphabetic artefacts:<br>

      That stone thing was also called gem, even though geologically it
      is not necessarily a gem, that could whether tell of any stone
      becoming a gem after it's polished, or that it was a good trick
      that even terracota miniature could be sold as a gem, and maybe
      that's the function of using the foreign word terracota instead of
      honest admitting that it's only clay.<br>

        power for overcoming the malice of enemies. (From Brit. Mus.,
        Greek Papyrus, Nu. CXXIV.–4th or 5th century.) (Kenyon, Greek
        Papyri, p. 123).<br>

        But of all the names found upon Gnostic gems two, i.e., Khnoubis
        (or Khnoumis), and Abrasax (or Abraxas), are of the most
        frequent occurrence. The first is usually represented as a huge
        serpent having the head of a lion surrounded by seven or twelve
        rays.<br>
        Over the seven rays, one on the point of each, are the seven
        vowels of the Greek alphabet, which some suppose to refer to the
        seven heavens; and on the back of the amulet, on which the
        figure of Khnoumis occurs, is usually found the sign of the
        triple S and bar.<br>
        Khnoumis is, of course, a form of the ancient Egyptian god
        Khnemu, or “Fashioner” of man and beast, the god to whom many of
        the attributes of the Creator of the universe were ascribed.<br>
      </font>yet I wonder if I wouldn't mistake Hnubis for Anubis. hm..
      and isn't abraxas Osiris then? I know I go too far. have fun.<br>
      <br>
      and the following image (also clickable) tells<br>
      <font size="+1">Judging from certain Gnostic gems in the British
        Museum, Abrasax is to be identified with the polytheistic figure
        that stands in the upper part of the Metternich stele depicted
        on p. 153 and below.<br>
        This figure has two bodies, one being that of a man, and the
        other that of a bird; from these extend four wings, and from
        each of his knees projects a serpent.<br>
        He has two pairs of hands and arms; one pair is extended along
        the wings, each hand holding the symbols of “life,” “stability,”
        and “power,” and two knives and two serpents; the other pair is
        pendent, the right hand grasping the sign of life, and the other
        a sceptre.<br>
        His face is grotesque, and probably represents that of Bes, or
        the sun as an old man; on his head is a pylon-shaped object with
        figures of various animals, and above it a pair of horns which
        support eight knives and the figure of a god with raised hands
        and arms, which typifies “millions of years.”<br>
        The god stands upon an oval wherein are depicted figures of
        various “typhonic” animals, and from each side of his crown
        proceed several symbols of fire.<br>
        Whether in the Gnostic system Abraxas absorbed all the names and
        attributes of this god of many forms cannot be said with
        certainty.”<br>
        E.A. Wallis Budge, Egyptian Magic, London, 1901. P. 177-80.<br>

      and though I don't see no alphabetic sequence I would expect to
      see next to someone with such name, I think I should ignore the
      texts at the top and the bottom, and maybe try to make sense out
      of the middle procession. Isn't it Thoth processing the very

      The image in the centre (with orange, blue, green, purple
      quadrants) is the only one explicitly showing that the sack is
      from this side of placenta. And thus our body in its full form is
      a sack of our own and the placenta is also ours and is on the
      outside of it.<br>
      But the second image before it shows that mother cells cover us,
      so that sack could be of mother genes.<br>
      So I leave it here as an artistic gesture, for me to look into
      again and for you to get excited and inspired.<br>

      Before I go I may want to ponder on colours. This basal stoned
      state can actually help here.<br>
      I figured out that black is bad and white is good (it is racist,
      but europe is racist, every nation in the world is racist, it is
      natural, even those jews who pimp multiculti are natie towards
      their own state they finally acquired. I hope this fact will
      pacify them and send them into a reflection, they're naturally
      two-assed, but now they can be shown at this fact. I hope this
      alone cures them.<br>
      <br>
      Yellow is gold, money. Brown is black (dark) yellow, bad gold, bad
      good, spoilt goods, rotten or recycled food. <br>
      Green is alive. (because plants show the difference more obviously
      in colour)<br>
      Red is important<br>
      I figured Black Green Red in BLM flag. but they align their flag
      as Red Black Green as if it tells Matter Black Lives. Warning,
      Black, Green (young, youth) So the flag tells Beware of Black
      Youth.<br>
      Warning! Black Youth. Y as in Yellow and желтый is almost зелёный.
      ЖЗ is how they go in the alphabet. Г and Blue should follow, neh?
      YG з in russian is where g is in latin. еёжз efgh, ge<font
        color="#cccccc">e</font>l is yellos, yellow is жёлтый. y ~ g
      (way ~ weg) Red and Orange are E &amp; F? E &amp; Ё? <br>
      It doesn't seem<font color="#cccccc"> to lean any where&nbsp; </font>to














      lead any where.<br>
      Red is алый? If geel is dutch, let's keep on working in dutch: red
      is rood or blozend, orange is oranje. (marantz or oranjevy in
      yiddish)<br>
      red = important<br>
      orange = glad?<br>
      yellow = gold<br>
      green = alive, young<br>
      light blue = light? soft? (not very sad, good sad, noble
      melancholy)<br>
      blue = sad<br>
      violet = violent (bruises are violet) or фиолетово is indifferent
      in russian.<br>
      <br>
      white is light<br>
      black is dark<br>
      brown is shit<br>
      grey is grave<br>
      this is some straight rainbow. square rainbow. with only four
      colours.<br>
      <br>
      6+4 is 10, which is interesting (there used to beonly 6 musical
      notes, and there is only 6 colours in some flags. Blue is one
      colour in english. 4 and 6 are how lines in english alphabet go.<br>
      <br>
      white as air? black as water? brown as gold? grey as green?<br>
      <br>
      red is a new white? red blood is clean, white, light. Blue blood
      is considered to be dirty, black and blue are not too far. even in
      russian siny &amp; cherny are not that far, siny is especially
      close to sery (blue to grey) and&nbsp; what I say here is language
      can demonstrate the evolution of understanding of colours. Some
      times blue were gray? Sky is both blue and grey. And black too.
      But isn't it never white? Never white.<br>
      Sun is white. And moon too. sol and lune, blanc, wiss, white ~
      light. So both moon and sun are white, and sky is black and can
      only be light blue when the sun comes. Clouds are white. Clouds
      are definitely white. облако может быть и содержит те же бл, что в
      белом.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm meticulous because я мучу. Мучаю? no, мучу в значении готовлю,
      из муки например, не из мУки, а из мукИ. both are probably one

      What is wonderful about alphabet is that out of 12 names, 6 begin
      with vowels. In english J is not vowel now, so there it's only 3,
      which if out of 12 is more than normal. But J is vowel originally
      it's I.<br>
      Январь-Февраль is very alphabetic beginning of the year. And
      calendars used to be alphabetic. And alphabet have alphabetic
      structures I discover and March being the first letter, as if it
      commands Start. <br>
      Fevraly is of fever, лютый, и так славянские названия месяцев

      I highlighted with grey Names which break the structure, and
      though octabr, nojabr could be black, they could be an ostracon of

      alphabet as a periodic table.<br>

      I thought of most years it's 365 days, and primitive childish
      decimal brain sees it as not dividing into ten, but well-dividing

      If J is dʒ, then only March is out of the abc. Otherwise we have
      three months (out of six) beginning with labials (none of the

      venus and mars are the closest planets to us.<br>
      J must be Earth, which looks one side at a day and the other side
      at the night. So whoever invented calendar they knew how planets
      work, they probably understood earth as a ball and created

        their closest approach, their separation is roughly 0.28 AU—no
        other planet gets nearer to Earth.&nbsp; </font>But then look
      at the previous screenshots: some of them are lying.<br>
      1 AU is 149,598,000 km (1.496e+8 km)<br>
      0.28 AU&nbsp; is 41,887,440 km.<br>
      Thus those screenshot disinforms again, they again give some
      average minimum or something.<br>

      If the months were attributed to planets.. as if moon appeared in
      some planet's house. I have to research it yet. Then there's a
      connection between days of week and months: mardi is of mars,
      lundi is of moon, so are these systems even correlate? Lundi Mardi
      Mercredi Jeudi Vendredi Samedi Dimanche<br>
      Mercredi is 100% after Mercury. <br>
      MMJ are like MarchMAyJune<br>
      Jeudi is probably Jupiter's. (or maybe of Jah? Sun? Apollo is a
      sun, Jah is too. isn't it? I dunno)<br>
      Vendredi is of Venus<br>
      Dimanche is some revamped to Sabbath or some other holy day, I
      think.<br>
      Why would the order of the weekdays be such? Mars after Moon?<br>
      I will return to this topic some other day. So far, I collected
      the astronomic gif: <br>

      Parliament and Funkadelic are ten-word letters, and I think I saw
      ten word letters as some government organizations.. We don't know
      if it's true, of course (I don't even remember what exaples there
      were) but what if some force outside of the music business taught
      the blacks some other manner of behaviour (other than white
      american) by introducing in use some another word. Funk as nasal
      Fuck. Now they have additional word for fucking, and thus fucking
      became a black thing, and thus white birth rate dropped. In my
      case it is because I strive for immortality. And that could be a
      rather common cause (those who want to drop white mortality

      English of Chinese and Russian from English: not necessarily

      borrow language if not genetically? Educated neighbours would
      influence educated nations to borrow their words: yes is
      understood in russian. So it can just come in passion And if it is
      morphologically modified (as джинсы, то это слово воспринимается
      родным и становится неотъемлемой частью языка. Джинсы наебнули

      maybe under the influence of people living in europe before
      chinese culture was brought to them with other miracles. and they
      understood wo as we and used we for their own.. я (me) is what we
      learn to be given something, and it is a согласие. and it sounds
      as yes. да ja? me we oui?<br>

      yes in chinese is 是的 shida<font color="#cccccc"> (it's

      thus second hieroglyph is literally да.&nbsp; 是 is the actual yes,
      and it is european si. And de could be used for russians to
      understand that word too. So shida went to be more powerful than <font
        color="#cccccc">shust </font>just si.<br>
      But that 的 is translated as of, which makes it de indeed. The
      french de.<br>

      So back to what I was saying before that: whites are the ones who
      strive for immortality (in my private case, and as indicates the
      birthrate drop and that only&nbsp; whites attend RAAD Fest. The
      only blackie I saw there was an employee of one company.<br>
      And it is a good and natural thing. The cutedge of tech is where
      retards are not welcome, and it could be correlated to Craig J

      that very de is used for aim in chinese. because de that place
      arrow have to hit, and thus de is to in english, and because
      french de is of in englihs, of and to is the same thing? I think
      some <strike>J</strike>o would be.<br>
      <br>
      <strike>j</strike>o is de and of? wouldn't it be just some <br>

      M is owl in egyptian (the owl you can often see in their texts is
      an alphabetic symbol of M, these tables are mostly correct (they
      differ in details) And M is also associated to see as mare, and
      water does reltat to mother, But a trick is all three matters are
      called mothers (that universal boncept of tridevi is probably much
      more abstract today, when we divided three times from three
      agregate states of matter, when we invented not to use the same
      concept to everything, because it can be misleading.<br>
      So M is not only for woman, which could be simpolizing it in many
      other ways (like the angle in the centre is the genital triangle,
      and 🜄 which is alchemic sign for water also has this shape. and M
      is similar to V and M is similar to N (we, me, nous, nos, нас, us,
      мы) and ν is greek N. - and probably other cultures had oher point
      of view on who is Mama (mama is daddy in georgian and deda s mama
      there)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      about the talking drums: I think it's like some popular song, they
      know the words because they know the song. But it's only a guess,,
      they can have some better rhythmic ear for standard phrases. But
      that is what I first thought. Now I think it's some song they both
      know. Songs allow texts to be encoded in melodies.<br>

      You can literally see it. He recognizes some standard phrase, they
      probably have some better ear for rhythms. Brian Eno said that<font

      I think syllables bear much more sense than single letters: <br>

      To realize is to implement into reality, to understand and to make
      should be divided by very short time so they are reality. Is it
      reality when it's in my head. Maybe yes, but also реализуй..

      Why have I never watched at serbian alphabet before? Some
      orthography is so weird that it makes me think that those forms of
      Д &amp; п &amp; т may have had some origin in the past, before
      Vuk. <br>
      Here's what I'm talking about: <font size="+1">Karadžić based his
        alphabet on the previous "Slavonic-Serbian" script<br>
      </font>Here's the difference:<font size="+1">&nbsp; Честь имамъ

        преполезну ИСТОРИЮ СЕРБСКУ, от коесамъ цѣло оглавленïе давно

      old it is and what was before it, wiki doesn't give a separate
      article to it. and here's the new version: <font size="+1">Част

        Revered Readers that I am, without any doubt, intent on printing

      S and T are united in Ottoman translated into russian as Osman.<br>
      and that relates to то~сё. but only if this~that.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      But if so many personal pronouns sound as yes, why does french
      nous is more like noes?<br>
      Is it where the antonymity of the pronouns manifest?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I wonder why we can speak with undefined syllables both yes and no
      when yes is a double syllable uh-hu and no is much more single
      whether longer than ones used in that yes or if double, the first
      part is so much more stronger than the second one, that it could
      be single and the second syllable would be just a phonetic swash.<br>
      <br>
      no as uno? duh as du?<br>
      but why are dogs taught the other way around?<br>
      is it because when A came to stand first B became second instead
      of being first. And though 2 is probably chronologically the first
      recognized letter, before 2 comes 1, and probably that's why Aa
      &amp; Д<i>д</i> are so alike, because ᚦ was the 1 when ᛒ was
      recognized as 2, and that is probably why not a single numeric
      sequence (LMN, UVW, and even EFГ, don't go in a straight order.
      EFГ is the closest to it, but it's in reversed. Is it a key, that
      they all were that way: HIי... MNL then? WUV? or is LN IH and M is
      the third in that ӀНМ? H standing for И which is currently used
      for I and ӏ stading for i is another argument pro that HIJKL
      thing)<br>
      <font color="#cccccc"><br>
      </font>But to close the serbian question for awhile, let's look at
      other fonts of theirs to see that those anomalies are present only
      in cursive (which may be much more informative than the official
      font, because cursive is not that much regulated. So on the
      following table they forgot about cursive majuscule, but the
      minuscule anomal т &amp; ш are shown:<br>

      it was <i>г п т</i> but what was it..<br>

      It's interesting, that Ш ends their order and its cursive is

        letters and between T &amp; Ш there are 7.<br>
        There are 14 letters between Г &amp; П, but he added so many new
        letters into that space, let's see it in russian: 12 between Г

      Now I wonder if I really know how academia works. What if they
      rejected me a couple of times to make me keep on working on this
      problem until the theory is enormous or before I give up if I
      didn't really want it as it would be if I stole it, for example.
      Would I keep on digging, if they published me? I don't know. At
      first I just wanted to make it better, making it bigger happened
      naturally. I kept on trying until I flew the way I fly now. I'm
      high as a kite and nuts as some nasdat naxi.<br>

      So even though there's georgian anomaly of mama &amp; deda, I
      consider it an anomaly. But baba as daddy, isn't it directly
      connected to that? Maybe, I look from the european perspective and
      I will look at it after I realize the sources and forms of pronoun
      antonymy. <br>
      I call M female letter, and J is male, and words like Man &amp;
      Жена I consider as some derivatives of them, meaning the opposite
      sex by the posession suffix -n of own. as they use similar suffix
      in russian and in japanese for genetivus. and male is probably a
      cognate of man, and female is a derivateive of it just as woman
      (and both female &amp; woman use labial prefixes, or maybe not
      directly cognates, but related, only -le suffix stand not for own,
      but for -like or something of the kind.<br>

      Look like water starts with M, I spoke about it before, and linked

      (мем огненной воды не оттуда же ли) противопоставленная твёрдой
      земле. Эрэц. Воздух по любому среди огневоды, среди проникаемых

      by accident.&nbsp; Эрэц последняя идёт. Шамаим первым идёт Ша
      огонь идёт первым. Может Алеф была огнём? Нет, огнём был Шин. Аш
      Вообще-то аш содержит и алеф и шин и начинается с алефа. Хорошо.
      Пусть аш будет א<br>
      Тогда маим остаётся Мемом, а эРэЦ это Р &amp; Ц. R &amp; Z. Г
      &amp; Д, zar rex господин. г-н, г-д, господень, К &amp; N, KinG,
      Qr Queen? K is king, Q is queen, C is caesar or царь, or count, G

      chinese also know about cabals of cabbalists and their hutzpah

      go, and worse than this, they fill us with some random information
      we have no idea if it's true or not.<br>
      School is also randomizer. School is enforced randomizer. Schools
      randomize our sphere of interest (it doesn't grow by the needs of
      our personal neural development, that program they read is rather
      random. They may interest you from time to time, but you
      immediately go to something else not allowed to go where you ask

      &gt; Если сформулировать главную теорию, которую вы выстроили, в
      одном предложении. Правильно ли было бы сказать так: наличие
      внутренней симметрии в алфавитах доказывает их непосредственную
      связь? &nbsp;Какие выводы позволяет сделать ваша теория? <br>
      <br>
      Их непосредственная связь была очевидна и до меня, моя теория
      показывает, что официальная наука, говорящая что финикийский -
      первый алфавит, понятия не имеет о чём она говорит, что в алфавите
      есть уровни гораздо более глубокие, чем уровень который
      представлен в финикийском. Уровень четырёх элементов. О трёх
      элементах, ещё более глубоком уровне понимания мира, до
      концептуализации воздуха наверное, говорят и греческий миф о
      создании алфавита и еврейский миф в книге сефер йецира, но там не
      сказано что их кто-то изобретал, сказано лишь что они есть, так
      что евреи не являются создателями алфавита, надеюсь они меня за
      подобные предъявы не удавят, потому что они хотя бы сохранили этот
      слой в своей культуре, остальные вообще папуасы в этом отношении
      (причём сохранили в виде, более ясном, чем в греческом мифе,
      именно как три матери, и в более базовом даже чем греческий миф,
      где א уже разложена по гамме AEIOU (предположительно, гласные
      родились из музыкальной грамоты, так что алфавит - это
      перекрещивание двух(!) элементов (женского и мужского, воды и
      огня) и гаммы, что означает что сначала алфавит был силлабарией, и
      лишь затем стал строго говоря алфавитом (что привлекает очень
      большое внимание к палеоиспанским системам письма) Мне интересно
      найти этот миф в египетском исполнении, но я пока не нашёл даже
      последовательности похожей на алфавитную (или на халахам, который
      они вроде использовали) но сейчас загуглил халакхам и нашёл
      https://lechaim.ru/news/pervaya-nadpis-semitskim-alfavitom-15-veka-do-nashej-ery-najdena-v-egipte/







      которая ссылается на
      https://www.timesofisrael.com/first-written-record-of-semitic-alphabet-from-15th-century-bce-found-in-egypt/







      где уже есть картинки, но в прошлый раз я видел одну из них - она
      позиционировалась как азбука в порядке халахам, я повтыкал и не
      понял как они это поняли по столь малому количеству строк, а
      сейчас говорят, что она ещё и двусторонняя.. сейчас допишу это
      письмо и отправлюсь читать

          версия более древняя: с одной стороны, сефер йецира
          непосредственно называет АМS (abc) тремя матерями, проводя во
          многом знак равенства между ними и мировым (учитывая, что не
          только европейцы и индусы, но и евреи и арабы эту тему знают:
          в строчках корана, называемыми сатанинскими стихами, именно
          они и упоминаются, как богини, которым арабы поклонялись до
          установления ислама) культом трёх матерей, которые мол создали
          (составляли?) гласные, Б, Т. (а форонида Ио была судя по всему
          жрицей, которой это открылось. Была ли она по совместительству
          известна как Сешат или нет мне пока не известно) а с другой
          стороны греческая версия отделяет два элемента (именно воду
          губных и огонь язычных) от гласных, показывая что это две
          разные системы. <br>

      Only today have I recognized that vowel trapezium is much more
      correct than I thought, so if you read my rant about it in vol.2
      and there was no link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant
      then you probably should return to volume 2 and look for trapezium
      in there.<br>
      <br>
      And even though that formant doesn't exactly correlate the
      previous representation of it by the arbitrary raise of the
      tongue, there are definitely many dialects and different people
      pronounce those vowels differently, and even though&nbsp; I like
      this new version much more, I still predict that it will show
      different in different выборка.<br>

      obsolete and it never was some good science, <font
        color="#cccccc">so the rant I initially placed in vol.2
        (continuation.html) makes some sense nevertheless it's also
        wrong per se and could be caused by me only quite feeling the
        front part of the tongue and not knowing that k is made by the
        back of the tongue until I was shown an mri or an xri image of
        pronounced k.<br>
        It's as if l in k is the palate and c is actually the tongue
        touching it with its back and me feeling it only now, but before
        I saw how it looks I felt it to be the part of my throat, as if
        some soft palate played here, little did I know that soft palate
        only works for nasals, which I found out only yesterday.</font><br>

      I wouldn't trust it directly, because it's singing and not
      talking. What comes next is some video in german, and other
      languages have different way to pronounce vowels, and even within
      one language different speakers my sound quite differently, all
      that could be influenced by the way they place their tongue, or it
      could be that within one dialect these forms are only influenced
      by the form of the skulls.<br>

      I thought that new gmail logo was bad, I even dared to write them
      about it, and now look how much it looks like my system as if it
      goes in columns (or in pages of an open book: first page tells of
      vowels and labials, the second page speaks of velars and coronals,
      as it could be in some azbuka of english.<br>

      I tried to place these letters into something of google colours,
      but it was so lame, and why be mistaken with google? my way of
      represent the same is not worse than theirs. it also speaks of
      bustrophaedon I don't know what to do with,&nbsp; Let's ponder on
      it: does this order negate egyptian "letter looks at the beginning
      of the line" thing? It rotates letters when they go the other way,
      so it keeps that rule, you can see where letters have face by
      looking at some bustrophaedon text.<br>

      Today I said to my gay friend "too bad A for asexual isn't
      included into LGBT, it would make it all easier" he laughed and

      <br>
      <img src="9_files/ally.png" alt="" width="275" height="183">&nbsp;
      Here it is some massive gay propaganda, telling of cis world as
      strict and boring, as some prisoner's pigama, which is of course
      false, gay is brown. I am so mean! I said of gay friends, do they
      know how much you are disgusted by their choice? How can I be such
      a hypocrite. Let's see at it deeper, blacks and whites make those
      6 colours triple: red yellow blue and orange green violet is a
      little less normal sequence, and though today we have red green
      blue as a standart, I don't know how do they get yellow of it,
      while orange is red and yellow, green is yellow and blue, violet
      is blue and red, so red yellow blue it probably is. Yellow is too
      light, red blue green those colours are, like the ones I chose to
      use.<br>

      not prove that ancient people knew chromosomes? but the graphical

      <br>
      But when I apply my links to that scale, I think I will have stars
      with many links between the main letters, and only few or none
      between the letters in the stars and other stars, and then
      operating with those newfound structures I will compare the links
      within the stars and the links outside of them, and if I find no

      Triple form in arabic is connected to previous, abugidaic
      structure? Som e A O E was in their syllabic tradition. maybe,
      thus those syllables naturally transformed into initial, middle,
      final version, and by similarity between those forms we can say
      which was is the basic form and how they tend to grow at both ends
      (I think final is the afterswash, and.. why guess if I can see:<br>

      بپتثلن یبپتثل نیبپتثلنی ب پتثلنیبپ تثلنیبپت ثلنی<br>
      is the same three lettrarii separated with spacebars elsewhere,
      only ی is different from toher other curves.. nah, ن is also
      specific in all fonts I saw. they're four (or only three in
      arabic, though fourth goddess is hidden by the other three you can
      see any given time. so you're confused if they're three or four.
      some trippy messages, l is higher above bcd's is n having not one
      end, but two ends raised? not Λ but N, so if we compare arabic and
      europic forms. Λ is ل and it is L, because they write the same
      image in the way they write it. L is leg, and it looks not in the
      beginning of the line, but it runs where the line runs, forward.
      So they misread egyptian hieroglyphs, and we can read them if we
      read lines with animals running forward, not backwards. Backwards
      didn't make no sense, and was established as a norm by some

      بیپ (ب ی پ) is beep because that's how it sounds, and because bp
      are the only labial letters in this group, and somehow they are
      singled out with a letter, whych could be y, the labial ю, or the

        does sun go all those degrees? No, it only visits some range on
        the southern sky. From the east to the west, and because the

        Numeral meaning of thos 28 makes no sense, because in that

        Z is 7 because H is 8 and h used to go <br>

        it to yandex pictures and google pictures, and they didn't find
        anything better than ᛟ, so I think I have seen those forms in

        combined, and I found this image, and if you click it, it leads
        to protosinaic script, showing that this form is similar to the

      Can I say that french is shorter version of english? <br>
      à mi-voix is At middle (of) voice but italian sotto voce is more
      common among englishmen.<br>
      in russian it's also a standard phrase: в пол голоса. Sotto voce
      is шёпотом, sotto is sub, под, ниже.<br>
      ниже is both descriptive and prescriptive.<br>

      Notice, that hieroglyphic 𓎚 stands for both voiced and voiceless
      h, but only recognized in voiceless form in both protocanaanite
      and archaic greek maybe too, according to the form of <img

      That table claims that 𓃾 [kꜣw] (“oxen”, and how similar that kꜣw

      They say that 𓃾 relates to 𒄞 (alpu) [GUD] bull, ox (so alpu or
      gud? alpu would related it directly to aleph) gud relates directly
      to govyad, govinda, cow.<br>

        I wonder what the other two are:

      Here, something related to Ϻ standing for S, Carian alphabets use
      the same forms greeks do, but apply them to sometimes completely
      different sounds:<br>

      <br>
      𐊣𐊫𐊺𐊼 of LOEK only can be arranged into abc (and even abcd)
      order if o plays the role of labial, which I doubt. 𐊺𐊫𐊼𐊣 as
      EOKL but I really, really doubt it, I doubt that that
      transliteration above is correct, but what do I know, I just must
      doubt everything, to be sharp.<br>
      I wonder why I didn't know about them before, that I do wonder.<br>
      And here some more: phrygian doesn't seem to have unicode bloc, so
      here it is in image: <br>

      <font size="+1">Transliteration of logograms is conventionally the
        term represented in Latin, in capital letters (e.g. PES for the
        logogram for "foot"). The syllabograms are transliterated,
        disambiguating homophonic signs analogously to cuneiform
        transliteration, e.g. ta=ta1, tá=ta2, and ta6 transliterate
        three distinct ways of representing phonemic /ta/.[10] Some of
        the homophonic signs have received further attention and new
        phonetic interpretation in recent years, e.g. tà has been argued
        to stand for /da/,[11] and á seems to have stood for /ʔa/
        (distinct from /a/), representing the descendant of
        Proto-Indo-European */h₁/.[12] One of the latest confirmed
        discoveries pertaining to the decipherment of Anatolian
        Hieroglyphs is the re-interpretation of the signs ta4 and ta5 as
        &lt;la/i&gt; and &lt;lá/í&gt; respectively [13]</font><br>

      A new piece on trinity:<br>
      <br>
      Some of you probably know of Amon-Rah, and it gets to this:<br>
      <font size="+1">In the Leiden hymns, Amun, Ptah, and Re are
        regarded as a trinity who are distinct gods but with unity in
        plurality.[13] "The three gods are one yet the Egyptian
        elsewhere insists on the separate identity of each of the
        three."[14] This unity in plurality is expressed in one
        text:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All gods are three: Amun, Re and Ptah,
        whom none equals. He who hides his name as Amun, he appears to
        the face as Re, his body is Ptah.</font><br>
      As you can notice, those names begin with vowel, labial and
      lingual.<br>
      <br>
      Then again I don't know if it's cherry-picking or not, but the
      Amun's name itself is rather alphabetic:<br>

      And I stumbled across this ancient piece of linguistics:<br>
      <img src="9_files/Alphabets_Japonois.png" alt="" width="939"
        height="1525"><br>
      From immediate finds is hiragana is named hiragana, because f and
      h is the same consonant in the syllabary. And some forms are
      whether colloquial, but hiragana ka immediately tells it's some
      artist's mistakes. Or if a native japanese wrote it, thatn they
      're dialectal, and actual, but I think It's an example of how
      academic science can be wrong.<br>
      <br>
      But it's still interesting, because it's also some other order: f
      goes before ka and after k m follows, which is weird. Especially,
      because the order A-Ka-Sa-Ta-Na is present, only as with the
      vowels (A I U is the common order and E &amp; O placed
      differently, but if we include ogham into the consideration, we
      can see that only the order of A first, all the other vowel are
      after that is the universal order indeed. But by the division such
      as japanese is closer to alphabets than ogham to them tells how
      much secretive and закрытым был огам, но на счёт того, что это они
      сохранили изначальный порадок букв, тогда как остальные его
      растратили сомнительно, потому что бет лойс нон is the name of
      oghamic canon, but b l <font color="#999999">f s </font>n it is
      today. Which may say that instead of 5 notes were only 3.<br>
      So it could be with vowels: a i u or a o e? o being two a is
      present in both ogham ᚐ ᚑ and runes ᛆᚮ, thus e could be the ᚒ
      which reminds E when it goes vertically, which it usually does.<br>
      + as A again, ⰰ is more +like sometimes.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">ᛝ would be great o in this context, but it's
        ng</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">Could ᚾ be ᚽ and thus ᚼ? no, too much of an
        assumption.</font><br>

      Only in 1st and 2nd conjugations does b appear in both past and
      future, it's more universal for past, for which b always appears,
      in all conjugations. I feel as if I show face when I say
      conjugations: like I сморщил морду и выставил язык прищурившись. <br>

      And they are here because I wanted to see how exactly does those
      future and past b's differ, to consider that b just be and before
      or after off there, of terra, and the difference is pretty
      obvious: in the past tense after b always a, and in the futurum it
      is anything but a, and literally anything: o, e, i, u, but not a.<br>

      there it had an addition of aicme named forfeda, which I only

      be used very cautiously) <font size="+1">The forfeda (sing.
        forfid) are the "additional" letters of the Ogham alphabet,
        beyond the basic inventory of twenty signs. Their name derives
        from fid ("wood", a term also used for Ogham letters) and the
        prefix for- ("additional").[1][2][3] The most important of these
        are five forfeda which were arranged in their own aicme or
        class, and were invented in the Old Irish period, several
        centuries after the peak of Ogham usage. They appear to have
        represented sounds felt to be missing from the original

      are wrong sometimes, so they all would be exposed as such frauds
      from time to time, and that could be the reason why there's no
      tradition of publishing drafts (of something which is naturally
      wasn't publishable enough, not to having come through the

      When they say "<font size="+1"> five forfeda</font>" they speak
      about the first five of the six, they are not divided into three

      were Irish vowels insufficient to the brits? because wiki could be
      much more correct: X could be just written across the staff to
      make the [x] which could happen to be mutated into k or who knows
      maybe eo sometimes. [oi] could be just o, the angular it had be
      because only straight lines are accepted so it seems, they're all
      straight. ui could be G, but that's a guess. others are too weird,
      I think those X &amp; O could be some signs more often than the
      others and the others are so rare they'rs авторские, ненастоящие,
      они вообще все, вся форфеда неаутентичная. Я это чувствовал, а
      затем и в вики прочитал, может чувствовал потому что раньше читал
      и сформировал своё мнение на счёт форфеды тогда, а сегодня лишь
      помнил решение, понял решение, но процесс его получения напрочь из
      памясти стёр, так и надо.&nbsp; <br>

      As you can see, if somebody created one system base on the other
      they would base it on it more similarly, but here we have absolute
      chaos, no comparison. And yet, the best picutres of pitman
      shorthand: <br>
      I could only find consonants, but it will be enough to compare: <br>
      <a
href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%8C_%D0%9F%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0"><img

          width="557" height="156"></a><br>
      as you can see, almost nothing similar, only the&nbsp; yay could
      compare, but that's not enough and as I said for devanagary: in
      Cree it's more systematic. <br>
      The only thing they could have (the missionaries) added from that
      pitman shorthand - is that some signs are doubled, which is not
      shown in the presentations of Cree I gave you in the previous
      volume.<br>
      But here is the missionaries' cree, what was his name.. James
      Evans, he could added those silly dashed forms:<br>
      <img src="9_files/640px-Evans_1841_Cree_script.jpg" alt=""
        width="640" height="640"><br>
      See, replication crisis, kali yuga, babylon. <br>
      <br>
      But that shorter star was considered more based: more close to the
      base:<br>
      <img src="9_files/a_better_reconstructed_cree.jpg" alt=""
        width="709" height="658"><br>
      Either way, let's start with learning them, and then we'll dig on
      further.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I see that ma and pa are similar quadrants, let's work with them:<br>
      <img src="9_files/m&amp;p.jpg" alt="" width="709" height="658"><br>
      Probably that was not the initial pattern, because why would
      vowels go in different order?<br>
      pa after ma, pi after mi, but then whether e or o goes the scuares
      (corners courts) disagree, and thus it is not as mnemonic as it
      could be. <br>
      <br>
      k and n are also similar, but легко запомнить: н ничком, к колом
      (ничком лежит, колом стоит)<br>
      <br>
      <img src="9_files/modified_tumblr_oqdjtmfLU81rwewyjo1_1280.jpg"
        alt="" width="808" height="728"><br>
      This is what I got when I grouped the lines by their vowels, and I
      got the direction to go clockwards.<br>
      <br>
      I go to bed with the heretic idea that if that comparison of
      devanagari to cree is accurate (it's far fetched I think, but I
      will look further into them) then it's Cree which reached India
      to.. but where is the eskimoic evidence? ice melts, so no
      evidence. They don't live on eyes, they probably have some bones
      and leather at least. Why would they need these signs? What rich
      literature do they have? Why do I shill for them? I never met
      them. I just see a glorious uniqness of the system and I read that
      Cree knew script before christians, but mostly because of the
      pattern of christian behavious towards ingenious systems.

      Another example of recent "invention" of a writing system:<br>
      <font size="+1">Zanabazar's square script is a horizontal
        Mongolian square script (Mongolian: Хэвтээ Дөрвөлжин бичиг,
        Khevtee Dörvöljin bichig or Mongolian: Хэвтээ Дөрвөлжин Үсэг,
        Khevtee Dörvöljin Üseg),[1] an abugida developed by the monk and
        scholar Zanabazar to write Mongolian. It can also be used to
        write Tibetan and Sanskrit.[2][3]</font><br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanabazar_square_script"><img
          src="9_files/600px-Zanabazar_Square_Consonants.svg.png" alt=""
          border="0" width="600" height="1200"></a>&nbsp;<br>
      Of course it can be used to write tibetan, because it is tibetan
      writing system, so if he invented anythig, it was not script, but
      font. Such is devanagari, but first compare to tibetan:<br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://omniglot.com/writing/tibetan.htm"><img
          src="9_files/tibetan_cons.gif" alt="" border="0" width="552"
          height="469"></a><br>
      <br>
      let's place them on the same plate:<br>
      <img src="9_files/tibetan_mongolan.png" alt="" width="1031"
        height="1114"><br>
      <font size="+1">Tibetan Buddhism, which preserves the Vajrayana
        teachings of eighth-century India, is practised in the countries
        of the Himalayan region, Mongolia, and Kalmykia.</font><br>
      tta ttha dda ddha nna and ta tha da dha na look so much alike,
      that they're fonts withing this font, different ways to write the
      same tibetan letters.<br>
      <br>
      he maybe added a couple of letters, such as gha, you know you can
      trust these tables completely. I saw mistakes and ommissions on
      other charts, on those I knew, these I compare blindly. Why read
      me? I will publish what I find. these are my drafts, pretty dirty
      and rather raw.<br>
      <br>
      In mongolian square script in tsa tsha dza you can see one raws
      repeating the other with some diacritics. <br>
      <br>
      and another reason to say that that mongolian square script is
      more authentic than some 17th century novodel is comparison of it
      to brahmi, and I start with ba so much more basic in mongolian
      than nepelian:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="9_files/brahmi_cons.gif" alt="" width="506" height="416"><br>
      <br>
      <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
      But suddenly I notice, that that ba is pretty much the only sign
      that correlates directly, others are too much different. Va I also
      recognize, and sure enough it's also va in mongolan. And if that
      nagle doesn't matter, I thnk I can recoglize la, but others, not
      so much. Okay, ya, and again more similar in mongolian than in
      tibetan. But ma is more recognizable in tibetan than in mongolian.
      Don't mongols have cows? Or maybe that is cow's head drawn in
      profile, and in tibetan you can see it in semi-profile with one
      horn to your side, and only the tip of the other can be seen from
      the head. Brahmic pha can be recognized in mongolian, so there are
      probably more, and my such work we can reconstruct the initial set
      or can we not, I leave it here for some smarter heads. <br>
      Bha shows, that whether my set of tibetan is not complete, or that
      Zanabazar used some source related to tibetan, but not the tibetan
      I use here.<br>

      are female, laying. (𓈕 in demotic is very much 一)<br>

      then it doesn't confuse me much that I may look just like l, or it

      to n, as if some japanese has to do womething with that: like hai
      is yes and nai is no.. or is it way too fart-fetched,

      This initial A does remind demotic 𓄿 and both print A and 𓄿
      remind eachother too.<br>
      also the third letter is probably s, which reminds that 𓎚 which
      is recognized as some h, but we know that h could easily be ʃ
      which could both originate from 𓎚 and cause that |-like s in that
      manuscript.<br>
      So here I directly say, that latin cursive comes directly from the
      demotic script? Then why wasn't demotic script understood? Could
      it be understood by coptic priests who just didn't recognize its
      connection to the temple texts?<br>
      Here, let me mirror it for you, so that it would go left to right
      as we do,<br>
      <img src="9_files/egyptian_a.png" alt="" width="418" height="239"><br>
      As you can see, with the exception of the swash in the right top
      corner, it's almost exactly cursive <i>a. </i><br>
      Or it's just linked to the following text not at the bottom, as we
      do it, but at the top.<br>
      <br>
      I don't see b, to try to reconstruct how would egyptian alphabet
      look, but let's mirror it all, maybe so we'll see it:<br>

        height="4686"><br>
      <br>
      Paradoxically, only now I notice that one of demotic forms of 𓇋
      looks like y. so 𓇋 is both i &amp; y.<br>
      It seems we see the vowels more than anything now, a, i, y, o, and
      e could come out of ie of 𓇋𓏱<br>
      By the way 𓏱 or 𓇋 looks either way when we compare 𓇋𓏱 to
      𓇋𓇋𓏱 I may think that those example are taken sometimes form
      left-to-right, sometimes from right-to-left texts. I could be
      wrong, but it's a direction to study.<br>
      <br>
      Let's look closer to the next vowel, o:<br>
      <img src="9_files/egyptian_o.png" alt="" width="424" height="169"><br>
      and I suppose that the first form is more distinct while the other
      two are just fasthand versions of it with a interswash connecting
      those wot halves directly reminding ᛃ <font color="#999999">or ᛜ</font><font
        color="#cccccc">,ᛝ</font><br>
      <br>
      And in the further letter it is seen that whether european scripts
      parted ways with egyptian demotic before that second form came out
      of the first (as the comment on the original table tells) or that
      those two forms coexisted into the latest times (and that comment
      on the original table tells they were) Because in the first and
      more distinct form you can see m or maybe even μ:<br>
      <img src="9_files/egyptian_m.png" alt="" width="410" height="61"><br>
      <font color="#cccccc">(the first form is to the right, this is a
        mirrored image)</font><br>
      <br>
      𓇋𓇋𓏱 doesn't surprise me after I know of y as ij.<br>
      <br>
      I don't want to cherrypick, so I will look at them all, but don't
      I cherry-pick when I say that w is hebrew vav when I used latin
      just before? I hope not, because they're explicitly the same
      system, and I compare cursive gimel to c and cursive dalet to d
      and het to h and so on.<br>
      <br>
      Demotic 𓃭 is l, this raises no question so far.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="9_files/egyptian_hets.png" alt="" width="420"
        height="118"><br>
      <br>
      this letter is the least understood so far, but it's still in
      minority, and it is some weird local h's so in could be whether
      some ζ or ξ or ص or ط or who knows what else.<br>
      <br>
      Some other signs are directly presented in the coptic, so it's not
      greek influenced coptic, but coptic influenced greek? Or did they
      influence one another? So that coptic influenced greed first, and
      then greek influenced coptic making in align in the alphabetic
      order.<br>
      <br>
      Even if I move 𓄿 above the line, I still have more different
      signs than the similar ones, and the way I give myself liberties
      to interpret the other signs, it could all be rather apophenic. <font
        color="#cccccc">Either way (aopophenic or not) it is here to
        demonstrate how I work and how I explore the possibilities of
        probably connections. and sometimes this labour gives good
        fruit. I still don't know if this comparison is truly etymologic
        or merely mnemonic. Either way, I told you it's a draft.</font><br>
      But then I have to move 𓅓 above the line too, for I recognized
      it. And then it's even. 13 letters per group which makes me wonder
      if that guy used english latin alphabet to play out of here, but
      then no, he had so many diffeent h's english doesn't have. so
      let's try to arrange those signs into english latin alphabet's
      grid:<br>
      <img src="9_files/demotin_in_latin_grid.png" alt="" width="2860"
        height="1148"><br>
      I did the best I could, I placed one of h's into c block, because
      of how demotic counterpart of it reminds russian cursive gimel,
      the <i>г.</i><br>
      I also placed y at Y's position in greek alphabet and one of h's
      into the x position in case it's ξ.<br>
      I don't know if one of s's had to take the position of z, either
      way, they're not that far from it, so you can see it. Maybe one of
      d's deserve the positon of z, maybe one of h's deserve the
      position of j.. <br>
      There's still too many t's and only one w and only one y for both
      u &amp; y.<br>
      So probably this 26's-ness is just a coincidence.<br>
      <br>
      That b of theirs, I think I know it's b without that j or what
      that snail could be and the demotic form of that hieroglyphic b is
      definitely a foot. or could book be of that form even then? I need
      some history of costume now.<br>

      or is a questioning form of to? I think it's my long-forgotten

      if V = Г = Λ then П is closer to V than before. even though both

      contrast of s being a form of t, c being a form of d contradicts
      and sounds here by a biggest resonance of all this work, it's as
      strong as m &amp; n being t &amp; p, even though p is 2 because of
      π which is not minuscule, but majuscule form of the same П in
      russian. (maybe because П &amp; п are so alike) and actually it
      questions both the origin of those minuscule greek forms and the
      validity of the legend from linguists that greek minuscule
      appeared only in the medieval times, because I think they confuse
      us when we ask them with minuscule in general, there's something

      I heard yesterday that miyazaki draws on average one minute per
      month, that's 60 seconds per 30 days. <br>
      60mal system is 360=60*6 and 60=6*10, so they knew 10 even then.<br>
      60 seconds per 30 days is 2 seconds per day it's 48 to 50 frames,
      and that is hiragana-katakana.<br>
      <font color="#666666">But even then they (in anime) draw less
        frames per second, so they probably draw some key frames and
        then fill in if they feel like it. Which is a smart thing to do.
        48 frames are 6 frames per an hour of standard 8-hour workday.
        one frame each 10 minutes.</font><br>

      Are children presented with teddybears to protect them when a real

      leave a child alone maybe, especially because they cling to those

      <font color="#cccccc">a piece they asked me to write for Academia
        Letters, can be of some interest fro my own readers too:</font><br>
      <br>
      The task I've placed before me is to disassemble words into
      morphemes and the morphemes into even shorter ones and to
      recognize those morphemes in other languages so I can assemble the
      words of those languages from the morphemes I know from my own so
      I can understand languages instead of memorizing them.
      Etymologically or merely mnemonically I don't care until some
      contradictions emerge. So I decide that chinese wo (I) is a
      singular form of english we, and that we is mirrored in russian as
      both мы and вы. Мы is mirrored back as me and Вы is an example of
      what I call antonymy of pronouns, when only several simple words
      are used as pronouns, but with different meaning, as if those were
      the names of the tribes and what was we for one tribe was you for
      the other, so german ich is их in russian, latin ego is его, and
      so on. And that very ego is probably to be disassembled into two
      or three smaller parts. Or maybe not.<br>
      A good place to start would be chinese, because their writing
      system conserved the language in the times when words were
      ultimately short: each hieroglyph is just one syllable. And thus
      we'll be able to write english in chinese hieroglyphs. Mama is
      obviously 媽媽 and I say that we can do so to every word, even
      though it's not the goal per se.<br>
      And at the same time, understanding that letters are probably the
      ultimate short parts, even shorter than those hieroglyphs, which
      can be disassebled into radicals, some of which are probably even
      related to the lettes we know, some of them can be found to be
      ligatures, as if 大 is ta or something, which is useful as a
      mnemonic tool even if it's not historically accurate, but then
      again truth is supposed to me the simplest path and thus these
      mnemonic techniques will eventually gravitate to the true
      etymologic lines.<br>
      And while I probably need some help from the ai to recognize all
      those pieces of those puzzles, I made some significant progress in
      that second route of recognizing what letters themselves are, and
      actually my project aeiou.ru being a travel log on all linguistic
      and extralinguistic topics is mostly about it, about the
      structures in alphabets (some of which are known to men and can be
      found in some obscurest treatices, others are probably unknown: so
      I found that alphabet is the repeating sequence of vowel, labial,
      linguals, vowel, labial, linguals, vowel (and here appears an
      universal exception of M replaced by J or K (which could stand for
      Jesus Kristos or could be some other initials, like Jah and
      Kronos, who knows, even priests of Apollo didn't know this
      structure, which was developed by the previous, matriarchal,
      society, which can be seen by the names of inventors: whether Io
      or Seshat. But then there's some other myth, where Odin invents
      runes, and being divided into three aettir they probably represent
      dice or the three elements, three mothers, three matters, three
      agregate states of it, which is just another evidence of runes
      being much more older than it's allowed to teach. If priests of
      Apollo knew those structures, they wouldn't mutilate the greek
      alphabet with the two additional vowels, as some myth tells, and
      myths have proven to be good historic sources on this prehistoric
      subject, even though it is a taboo, probably because the word myth
      has at least double meaning.<br>
      So, yes, some structures are known from some obscure literature;
      others, such as symmetry around the vowels where a comes on top,
      bc below it, def (with the vowel in the centre) further on and
      here the tetraktis structure (which could be the source of this
      symmetry) leaves place to something else, because further goes
      ghijk and lmnopqr so that this line winks that it's not a
      coincidence with l at the left end and r at the right. stuvw xyz
      and it appears to be the case in many other alphabets. Armenian
      doesn't follow any of those structures, but memoirs of his
      students show that it's only because he mutilated the previous
      armenian alphabet (yep, he didn't invent it, probably none of
      those christian missionaries did) which followed greek canon, with
      his own letters, which you can find by comparing armenian to greek
      side by side. So even though kabbalah teaches that each letter has
      its meanings, and Yoram Lemelman even made a dictionary after he
      recognized those meanings, I salute him <font color="#cccccc">(with
        a natie salute just to make him and y'all relax, stop reigning
        with fear, it's the worst form of rule, you can do better than
        that, of if you don't you're incompetent so you intimidate the
        competition, which is lame and you should know it) </font>but I
      decide to make my findings independently so later I can compare
      what I found with what he already published. At first I even
      avoided reading what other people write about alphabets, it
      appears they don't know much anyway now when I read them I can
      tell. Even Diringer can mistake syllabary for an alphabet, but
      it's not about that. <br>
      Then ancient music theories can be of much help to reconstruct
      those structures, those five vowels the greek myth tells of could
      be the source of pentatonic scale and b t, the labials and
      linguals into which consonants are divided could be some primitive
      forms of bemol and diez (I know what they say about this stuff,
      that it's relatively recent, but then some recent stuff may happen
      to be reinvention or restoration of the older one, so you always
      should dig depper to find roman cursive ater you were taught that
      minuscule appeared only in the mideaval times (which could be true
      for the greek minuscule, but could also be not, who knows, they
      had so many dialects in there, so many languages used that writing
      system, that only yesterday have I learnt about the bactrian

      Ϸϸ, how could I be not knowing it!<br>
      and looking for it in unicode, can you believe that ϻ is a
      minuscule form of san, so that is literally the same letter M,
      only it's read completely differently. what on earth was going on
      there! if that greek letter had a minuscule form, it's completely
      false that minuscule is from medieval times.<br>
      Either way, Bactrian:<br>

      look at how a &amp; d meet again in minuscule. and o too. hm..<br>
      <br>
      It is some greek alphabet, and it is some minuscule as I can see,
      so their teachings are all false. Even though phonetic trapezium,
      which is named so, but only includes vowels, so I think, but then
      I remember of formants and probably not only vowels, no, but
      either way they all seem to be wrong by placing some 3-dimensional
      structures into 0-dimensional dots on their 2-dimensional scales<br>
