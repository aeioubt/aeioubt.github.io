      I don't know what those ten long cylindrical things is, because 十本
      is just ten books, so I searching for images of 十本 I wonder if
      it's an ai playing 十本 recognize those ten scrolls like this or
      does it have some ancient reference.<br>
      <br>
      Let's just directly compare chinese signs to alphabetic ones, and
      we'll find the common ground:<br>
      <br>
      一 is i<br>
      十 is t<br>
      these are simple.<br>
      大 is probably ligature ta, but it's not for sure.<br>

        is m<br>
        (it's because i ni mi are 1 2 3 in japanese, even though they
        say ichi ni san, ichi nichi mitsu would probably be recognized.
        the reason I make such long comment on it is that ichi is hitsu,
        closely related to the sun, sun is one. un. is it where san
        letter comes? s+nasal. both S &amp; M are She and Me.<br>
        (even though I'm a guy, not the guy who invented language, gal
        it was, they speak more than us))<br>
        五 is G (because of japanese go, I declare that japanese were the
        first literari in there, chinese only usurped them for
        centuries, during which they stole their achievements and
        declared them their own. I am a wicked man, don't I affraid to
        be burnt as a witch? Beware, my dear, you are way too bold. So I
        get intimidated and I mention again, that it's only a hypothetic
        pondering, I dare to touch all the possibilities, and this is a
        one of them hanging in the air of my speculations.<br>
        八 is H<br>
        and it could reveal some numeral order, where 8 followed 5, as
        if it was of those 147 258 369 square.<br>
        then F would be 2 and I think we said that 2 is n. ngh? n as ν?<br>
        f as in futa, another way to pronounce 二<br>
        FGH 二五八<br>
        and because F is digamma,<br>
        一 is also Г and thus i ~ c.<br>
        c as the first letter? are you sure? Ϸϸ is supposed to be the
        first letter, because it's only natural that 1 comes before 2,
        so thus ᚦ comes before ᛒ<br>
        and if ᚦ is θ then isn't it Θ and isn't it ☉ and when I was
        looking for that sign, I found this:<br>
        <font size="+1">Salt represented the body 🜔</font><br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_symbol"><img
            src="10_files/alchemical_symbols.png" alt="" border="0"
            width="896" height="488"></a><br>
        <font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sulfur represented the soul
          (the emotions and desires) 🜍<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercury represented the spirit
          (imagination, moral judgment, and the higher mental faculties)
          ☿ <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Salt represented the body 🜔</font><br>
        I'm pretty sure these signs and all this alchemic theory can
        tell a lot to this research, because it's magic, and magic is
        ancient. not as ancient as the nature, but ancient nevertheless,
        or actually a little less. Or maybe not, who knows, if we
        consider it taking roots in the basics of nature itself, maybe
        before what we call the nature itself.<br>
        Those four 🜔🜕🜖🜗 are what I would study the first. They seem
        very fundamental in their graphic part, and I don't even
        understand what the other three out of the four are.<br>
        🜀 is aether, it is awesome and also shows that it's much newer
        than those 🜁🜂🜃🜄<br>
        I believe that sign is ae, but why does it look like qe? <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I think I found myself a reason to study japanese by learning
        this crazy song:<br>

        But this anime explains it perfectly or it rather resonates it
        by that girl being a guy inside.<br>

        I also wonder why do they have two different fonts for の and why
        does it appear so big, when upstairs, the second sign of the
        most of those blocks, it is tidily tiny. この is tiny, but once
        you remove the こ, の becomes large like this. wild thang.<br>

      Did lack of lactase gave birth to the word жид?<br>
      This phenomenon alone could cause animosity of theirs towards

      Mercury salt and sulfur are three primes in alchemy, so they may
      be related to the three mothers.<br>
      I take it from https://blog.prepscholar.com/alchemy-symbols and
      though the image there seems to be some artistic fantasy, I copy
      the text here, because if it's true, it probably relate to the
      alphabets directly, because of the number, 22, as many as letters
      are there in hebrew alphabet.<br>

        22 Alchemy Symbols and Their Meanings<br>
        <br>
        Below are the four main groups of alchemy element symbols, along
        with their meanings.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The Three Primes<br>
        <br>
        The three primes, also known as the tria prima, were named by
        Paracelsus, a Swiss philosopher, in the 16th century. He
        believed the tria prima contained all the poisons that caused
        disease, and that by studying them, alchemists could learn how
        to cure disease. He also believed the tria prima defined humans,
        and he assigned each of the elements to a different part of the
        human identity.<br>
        &nbsp;</font><br>
      <font size="+1"><big>
          <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
            charset=UTF-8">
        </big></font>☿<font size="+1"><br>
        Mercury (which is also one of the seven planetary metals) can
        mean both the element and the planet. In either case, this
        alchemy symbol represents the mind, as well as a state that
        could transcend death. In ancient times, mercury was known as
        quicksilver, and it was believed to be able to shift between
        liquid and solid states. Therefore, in alchemy, mercury was
        believed to shift between life and death.<br>
        Mercury is often represented by a serpent/snake, and its symbol
        is said to resemble a cosmic womb. Mercury is also sometimes
        said to represent the passive female principle, as well as
        wetness and cold. You can see the standard “female” sign within
        its symbol.<br>
      </font><br>
      🜔<font size="+1"><br>
        Salt is now known to be a chemical compound comprised of sodium
        and chloride, but alchemists believed it was a single element.
        Salt represents the body, as well as physical matter in general,
        crystallization, and condensation. Salt is often impure when
        first collected, but through chemical processes it can be
        dissolved and purified, which some alchemists compared to
        purification processes the human body can undergo. Its symbol is
        a circle bisected by a horizontal line.<br>
      </font><br>
      🜍<font size="+1"><br>
        Sulfur, also known as brimstone, is the active male counterpart
        to mercury’s passive female representation. In antiquity, it was
        used as traditional medicine in places ranging from China to
        Egypt to Europe. It’s mentioned in both the Torah and the Bible,
        the latter of which states that Hell smells like sulfur.<br>
        Sulfur represents properties such as dryness, heat, and
        masculinity. In alchemy, it could also represent evaporation,
        expansion, and dissolution. In terms of human body, it
        represented the soul. In terms of the tria prima, sulfur was
        seen as the middling element connecting salt (high) and mercury
        (low).<br>
        Sulfur’s symbol is typically a triangle atop a Greek cross (seen
        above), but it can also be represented by a Cross of Loraine
        atop an ouroboros/infinity symbol. This symbol has come to be
        known as Satan’s Cross and is sometimes used as a satanic
        symbol.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The Four Classical Elements<br>
        <br>
        The Classical Elements are based on the ancient Greek belief
        that air, earth, fire, and water composed all matter in the
        world. Unlike many of the other elements in this guide, these
        four aren’t elements you can find on the periodic table, but
        alchemists believed to have significant powers, as well as the
        ability to create new elements.<br>
        <br>
        Medieval Arab alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan was one of the first to
        connect the four elements to alchemy, but the classical elements
        were well-studied in ancient Greece before that. The ancient
        Greek physician Hippocrates connected each to one of the four
        humours of the human body, while Aristotle connected each to a
        principle of heat/cold and dryness/moisture.<br>
      </font><font size="+1"></font><br>
      🜁<font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
          </font></font>Air</font><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
        </font>Aristotle stated that air represented heat and wetness
        (the wetness is from water vapor, which was thought to be part
        of air). The air symbol in alchemy can also represent a
        life-giving force, and it is associated with the colors white
        and blue. Hippocrates associated air with blood. Air’s symbol is
        an upward triangle bisected by a horizontal line, and you might
        notice it is the Earth symbol, inverted.<br>
      </font><br>
      🜃<font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
          </font></font>Earth</font><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
        </font>Aristotle labeled Earth as cold and dry. Earth can
        represent physical movements and sensations, and it’s associated
        with the colors green and brown, and the humor black bile.
        Earth’s symbol is the inverse of air’s: a downward-point
        triangle bisected by a horizontal line.<br>
      </font><br>
      🜂<font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
        </font>Fire<br>
        In alchemy, fire represents emotions such as passion, love,
        anger, and hate, which are sometimes referred to as “fiery”
        emotions. Aristotle labeled it as hot and dry, and it is
        represented by the colors red and orange, as well as the humor
        yellow bile. Additionally, fire is also seen as a more masculine
        symbol. The fire alchemy symbol is an upward-pointing triangle.<br>
        &nbsp;</font><br>
      🜄<font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
        </font>Water<br>
        Aristotle labeled water as cold and wet, and Hippocrates
        connected it to the body humor phlegm. Additionally, it’s
        associated with intuition as well as the color blue, and is
        often linked to the alchemy symbol of mercury (as both are seen
        as feminine symbols). The Greek philosopher Thales believed
        water was the first substance created in the world.<br>
        As another contrast to fire, the water alchemy symbol is the
        inverse of the fire symbol; a downward-point triangle. This
        symbol is sometimes said to resemble containers for holding
        water, such as a cup or urn.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The Seven Planetary Metals<br>
        <br>
        Each of these elements is a metal, and they are each connected
        to a celestial object, as well as a day of the week and an organ
        in the body. Astronomy was a major part of early alchemy, and
        during the classical era, each planet was thought to “rule” over
        its associated metal, with its position in the sky and proximity
        to other planets affecting the metal’s properties.<br>
        <br>
        You might notice that Uranus and Neptune aren’t included; that’s
        because these symbols were created before telescopes were
        invented, and thus only planets visible to the naked eye were
        known to exist.<br>
        <br>
      </font><br>
      ♄<font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
          </font></font>Lead<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Celestial body: Saturn<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day of the week: Saturday<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organ: Spleen<br>
        <br>
        Lead (known as plumbum in classical times) has a symbol known as
        a “crescent below the cross,” and it looks similar to a scythe
        or a stylized “h” with a cross on top.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
      </font>♃<font size="+1"><br>
        Tin<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Celestial body: Jupiter<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day of the week: Thursday<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organ: Liver<br>
        <br>
        Tin’s symbol is known as a “crescent below the cross,” and it
        looks like a stylized “4”.<br>
      </font><br>
      <font size="+1"><br>
      </font>♂<font size="+1"><br>
        Iron<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Celestial body: Mars<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day of the week: Tuesday<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organ: Gallbladder<br>
        <br>
        The “male” symbol often used to represent the planet Mars is the
        alchemy symbol for iron.<br>

        <br>
        Gold represented perfection, and it was one of the most
        prominent symbols in alchemy. A key (and unfulfilled) goal of
        many alchemists was to learn how to turn lead into gold. Two
        symbols can represent the gold alchemy symbol. The first looks
        like a stylized sun with rays emitted from it, and the second is
        a circle with a dot in its center.<br>

        The symbol for copper can be either the “female” symbol (also
        used to represent the planet Venus) or a set of crossed and
        horizontal lines.<br>

        Silver’s alchemy symbol looks like a crescent moon, the same way
        gold’s symbol looks like a small sun. The crescent can be drawn
        facing either the right or the left.<br>

        Mundane Elements<br>
        <br>
        The mundane elements make up the rest of the elements used in
        alchemy. They are typically more recent additions to alchemy,
        and they don’t have as long a history as some of the other
        elements. As a result, less information is known about their
        alchemy symbols and what they represent, although all were used
        by alchemists at some point.<br>

        Antimony<br>
        Antimony represents the wild/animalistic parts of human nature.
        Antimony’s symbol is a circle with a cross above it (or the
        upside-down female symbol), and it is also sometimes represented
        as a wolf.<br>

        Arsenic<br>
        In alchemy, arsenic is often represented by a swan or swans.
        This is because, as a metalloid, arsenic is capable of
        transforming its physical appearance (a metallic-gray solid or a
        yellow crystalline solid), the same way a cygnet transforms into
        a swan. Its symbol is a pair of overlapping triangles.<br>

        Bismuth<br>
        Not much is known about how bismuth was used in alchemy, but
        until the 18th century, it was often confused with tin and lead.
        Its symbol looks like an “8” that is open at the top.<br>

        Magnesium<br>
        Magnesium isn’t found in its pure form, so alchemists used
        magnesium carbonate (also known as “magnesium alba”) when
        conducting experiments. Because magnesium can’t be extinguished
        easily once it has been ignited, it represented eternity to
        alchemists. Several symbols can represent it; the one above is
        the most common.<br>
      </font><font color="#cccccc">(and that actually where the order
        became different in that site and wiki: in wiki Boron follows
        bismuth, probably by alphabet. They all go by alphabet, wiki
        just includes several mundane elements more, so that 22 elements
        is under a question now)</font><font size="+1"><br>

        Phosphorus<br>
        Phosphorus was an important element for alchemists because it
        appeared to have the ability to capture light. (When the white
        form of phosphorus oxidizes, it glows green.) It represented the
        spirit, and its symbol is typically a triangle atop a double
        cross.<br>

        Platinum<br>
        Alchemists believed platinum was a combination of gold and
        silver, which is why its symbol is the combination of the
        symbols of each of those elements.</font><font color="#cccccc"><br>
        Here we also don't have a unicode of this as ligature, so I have
        to use the combination of two symbols. So in general it makes me
        think that these mundane symbols were not in the alchemy at
        first, also further somebody needed to pull it to hebrew
        alphabet or whatever were their reason, anyway they're
        demonstratively wrong.</font><font size="+1"><br>

        Potassium<br>
        Potassium isn’t naturally found as a free element, so alchemists
        used potassium carbonate, often known as “potash,” in their
        experiments. The symbol for potassium is a rectangle atop a
        cross.<br>

        Zinc<br>
        Alchemists burned zinc to create zinc oxide, which they called

        Summary: Alchemy Symbols and Meanings<br>
        <br>
        Alchemy element symbols have existed for over a thousand years,
        and they were a key component of alchemy, as well as related
        fields of study such as astronomy, medicine, and philosophy.<br>
        <br>
        Each alchemy symbol corresponding to a specific element or
        compound. For example, the fire alchemy symbol looks like an
        upward-point triangle, while the alchemy earth symbol appears as
        a downward-pointing triangle bisected by a horizontal line.
        Alchemy symbols sometimes contain hints as to the properties the
        element was thought to have, as well as the history of the
        element.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
      </font><br>
      And so, because mercury is mentioned twice, those 22 are truly 21.<br>
      <br>
      but then wiki adds 3 more elements to those mudane 8:<br>

        <br>
        The alchemical magnum opus was sometimes expressed as a series
        of chemical operations. In cases where these numbered twelve,
        each could be assigned one of the Zodiac signs as a form of
        cryptography. The following example can be found in Pernety's
        1758 Mytho-Hermetic Dictionary:[3]<br>
