      I don't know what those ten long cylindrical things is, because 十本
      is just ten books, so I searching for images of 十本 I wonder if
      it's an ai playing 十本 recognize those ten scrolls like this or
      does it have some ancient reference.<br>

      Let's just directly compare chinese signs to alphabetic ones, and
      we'll find the common ground:<br>
      <br>
      一 is i<br>
      十 is t<br>
      these are simple.<br>
      大 is probably ligature ta, but it's not for sure.<br>

        is m<br>
        (it's because i ni mi are 1 2 3 in japanese, even though they
        say ichi ni san, ichi nichi mitsu would probably be recognized.
        the reason I make such long comment on it is that ichi is hitsu,
        closely related to the sun, sun is one. un. is it where san
        letter comes? s+nasal. both S &amp; M are She and Me.<br>
        (even though I'm a guy, not the guy who invented language, gal
        it was, they speak more than us))<br>
        五 is G (because of japanese go, I declare that japanese were the
        first literari in there, chinese only usurped them for
        centuries, during which they stole their achievements and
        declared them their own. I am a wicked man, don't I affraid to
        be burnt as a witch? Beware, my dear, you are way too bold. So I
        get intimidated and I mention again, that it's only a hypothetic
        pondering, I dare to touch all the possibilities, and this is a
        one of them hanging in the air of my speculations.<br>
        八 is H<br>
        and it could reveal some numeral order, where 8 followed 5, as
        if it was of those 147 258 369 square.<br>
        then F would be 2 and I think we said that 2 is n. ngh? n as ν?<br>
        f as in futa, another way to pronounce 二<br>
        FGH 二五八<br>
        and because F is digamma,<br>
        一 is also Г and thus i ~ c.<br>
        c as the first letter? are you sure? Ϸϸ is supposed to be the
        first letter, because it's only natural that 1 comes before 2,
        so thus ᚦ comes before ᛒ<br>
        and if ᚦ is θ then isn't it Θ and isn't it ☉ and when I was
        looking for that sign, I found this:<br>
        <font size="+1">Salt represented the body 🜔</font><br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_symbol"><img
            src="10_files/alchemical_symbols.png" alt="" border="0"
            width="896" height="488"></a><br>
        <font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sulfur represented the soul
          (the emotions and desires) 🜍<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercury represented the spirit
          (imagination, moral judgment, and the higher mental faculties)
          ☿ <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Salt represented the body 🜔</font><br>
        I'm pretty sure these signs and all this alchemic theory can
        tell a lot to this research, because it's magic, and magic is
        ancient. not as ancient as the nature, but ancient nevertheless,
        or actually a little less. Or maybe not, who knows, if we
        consider it taking roots in the basics of nature itself, maybe
        before what we call the nature itself.<br>
        Those four 🜔🜕🜖🜗 are what I would study the first. They seem
        very fundamental in their graphic part, and I don't even
        understand what the other three out of the four are.<br>
        🜀 is aether, it is awesome and also shows that it's much newer
        than those 🜁🜂🜃🜄<br>
        I believe that sign is ae, but why does it look like qe? <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I think I found myself a reason to study japanese by learning
        this crazy song:<br>

        But this anime explains it perfectly or it rather resonates it

        I also wonder why do they have two different fonts for の and why
        does it appear so big, when upstairs, the second sign of the
        most of those blocks, it is tidily tiny. この is tiny, but once
        you remove the こ, の becomes large like this. wild thang.<br>

      This phenomenon alone could cause animosity of theirs towards

      Mercury salt and sulfur are three primes in alchemy, so they may
      be related to the three mothers.<br>
      I take it from https://blog.prepscholar.com/alchemy-symbols and
      though the image there seems to be some artistic fantasy, I copy
      the text here, because if it's true, it probably relate to the
      alphabets directly, because of the number, 22, as many as letters
      are there in hebrew alphabet.<br>

        22 Alchemy Symbols and Their Meanings<br>
        <br>
        Below are the four main groups of alchemy element symbols, along
        with their meanings.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The Three Primes<br>
        <br>
        The three primes, also known as the tria prima, were named by
        Paracelsus, a Swiss philosopher, in the 16th century. He
        believed the tria prima contained all the poisons that caused
        disease, and that by studying them, alchemists could learn how
        to cure disease. He also believed the tria prima defined humans,
        and he assigned each of the elements to a different part of the
        human identity.<br>
        &nbsp;</font><br>
      <font size="+1"><big>
          <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
            charset=UTF-8">
        </big></font>☿<font size="+1"><br>
        Mercury (which is also one of the seven planetary metals) can
        mean both the element and the planet. In either case, this
        alchemy symbol represents the mind, as well as a state that
        could transcend death. In ancient times, mercury was known as
        quicksilver, and it was believed to be able to shift between
        liquid and solid states. Therefore, in alchemy, mercury was
        believed to shift between life and death.<br>
        Mercury is often represented by a serpent/snake, and its symbol
        is said to resemble a cosmic womb. Mercury is also sometimes
        said to represent the passive female principle, as well as
        wetness and cold. You can see the standard “female” sign within
        its symbol.<br>
      </font><br>
      🜔<font size="+1"><br>
        Salt is now known to be a chemical compound comprised of sodium
        and chloride, but alchemists believed it was a single element.
        Salt represents the body, as well as physical matter in general,
        crystallization, and condensation. Salt is often impure when
        first collected, but through chemical processes it can be
        dissolved and purified, which some alchemists compared to
        purification processes the human body can undergo. Its symbol is
        a circle bisected by a horizontal line.<br>
      </font><br>
      🜍<font size="+1"><br>
        Sulfur, also known as brimstone, is the active male counterpart
        to mercury’s passive female representation. In antiquity, it was
        used as traditional medicine in places ranging from China to
        Egypt to Europe. It’s mentioned in both the Torah and the Bible,
        the latter of which states that Hell smells like sulfur.<br>
        Sulfur represents properties such as dryness, heat, and
        masculinity. In alchemy, it could also represent evaporation,
        expansion, and dissolution. In terms of human body, it
        represented the soul. In terms of the tria prima, sulfur was
        seen as the middling element connecting salt (high) and mercury
        (low).<br>
        Sulfur’s symbol is typically a triangle atop a Greek cross (seen
        above), but it can also be represented by a Cross of Loraine
        atop an ouroboros/infinity symbol. This symbol has come to be
        known as Satan’s Cross and is sometimes used as a satanic
        symbol.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The Four Classical Elements<br>
        <br>
        The Classical Elements are based on the ancient Greek belief
        that air, earth, fire, and water composed all matter in the
        world. Unlike many of the other elements in this guide, these
        four aren’t elements you can find on the periodic table, but
        alchemists believed to have significant powers, as well as the
        ability to create new elements.<br>
        <br>
        Medieval Arab alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan was one of the first to
        connect the four elements to alchemy, but the classical elements
        were well-studied in ancient Greece before that. The ancient
        Greek physician Hippocrates connected each to one of the four
        humours of the human body, while Aristotle connected each to a
        principle of heat/cold and dryness/moisture.<br>
      </font><font size="+1"></font><br>
      🜁<font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
          </font></font>Air</font><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
        </font>Aristotle stated that air represented heat and wetness
        (the wetness is from water vapor, which was thought to be part
        of air). The air symbol in alchemy can also represent a
        life-giving force, and it is associated with the colors white
        and blue. Hippocrates associated air with blood. Air’s symbol is
        an upward triangle bisected by a horizontal line, and you might
        notice it is the Earth symbol, inverted.<br>
      </font><br>
      🜃<font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
          </font></font>Earth</font><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
        </font>Aristotle labeled Earth as cold and dry. Earth can
        represent physical movements and sensations, and it’s associated
        with the colors green and brown, and the humor black bile.
        Earth’s symbol is the inverse of air’s: a downward-point
        triangle bisected by a horizontal line.<br>
      </font><br>
      🜂<font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
        </font>Fire<br>
        In alchemy, fire represents emotions such as passion, love,
        anger, and hate, which are sometimes referred to as “fiery”
        emotions. Aristotle labeled it as hot and dry, and it is
        represented by the colors red and orange, as well as the humor
        yellow bile. Additionally, fire is also seen as a more masculine
        symbol. The fire alchemy symbol is an upward-pointing triangle.<br>
        &nbsp;</font><br>
      🜄<font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
        </font>Water<br>
        Aristotle labeled water as cold and wet, and Hippocrates
        connected it to the body humor phlegm. Additionally, it’s
        associated with intuition as well as the color blue, and is
        often linked to the alchemy symbol of mercury (as both are seen
        as feminine symbols). The Greek philosopher Thales believed
        water was the first substance created in the world.<br>
        As another contrast to fire, the water alchemy symbol is the
        inverse of the fire symbol; a downward-point triangle. This
        symbol is sometimes said to resemble containers for holding
        water, such as a cup or urn.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The Seven Planetary Metals<br>
        <br>
        Each of these elements is a metal, and they are each connected
        to a celestial object, as well as a day of the week and an organ
        in the body. Astronomy was a major part of early alchemy, and
        during the classical era, each planet was thought to “rule” over
        its associated metal, with its position in the sky and proximity
        to other planets affecting the metal’s properties.<br>
        <br>
        You might notice that Uranus and Neptune aren’t included; that’s
        because these symbols were created before telescopes were
        invented, and thus only planets visible to the naked eye were
        known to exist.<br>
        <br>

      ♄<font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
          </font></font>Lead<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day of the week: Saturday<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organ: Spleen<br>
        <br>
        Lead (known as plumbum in classical times) has a symbol known as
        a “crescent below the cross,” and it looks similar to a scythe
        or a stylized “h” with a cross on top.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organ: Liver<br>
        <br>
        Tin’s symbol is known as a “crescent below the cross,” and it
        looks like a stylized “4”.<br>
      </font><br>
      <font size="+1"><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day of the week: Tuesday<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organ: Gallbladder<br>
        <br>
        The “male” symbol often used to represent the planet Mars is the
        alchemy symbol for iron.<br>

        Gold represented perfection, and it was one of the most
        prominent symbols in alchemy. A key (and unfulfilled) goal of
        many alchemists was to learn how to turn lead into gold. Two
        symbols can represent the gold alchemy symbol. The first looks
        like a stylized sun with rays emitted from it, and the second is
        a circle with a dot in its center.<br>

        Silver’s alchemy symbol looks like a crescent moon, the same way

        Mundane Elements<br>
        <br>
        The mundane elements make up the rest of the elements used in
        alchemy. They are typically more recent additions to alchemy,
        and they don’t have as long a history as some of the other
        elements. As a result, less information is known about their
        alchemy symbols and what they represent, although all were used
        by alchemists at some point.<br>

        Antimony represents the wild/animalistic parts of human nature.
        Antimony’s symbol is a circle with a cross above it (or the

        as a wolf.<br>

        Arsenic<br>
        In alchemy, arsenic is often represented by a swan or swans.
        This is because, as a metalloid, arsenic is capable of
        transforming its physical appearance (a metallic-gray solid or a
        yellow crystalline solid), the same way a cygnet transforms into
        a swan. Its symbol is a pair of overlapping triangles.<br>

        Bismuth<br>
        Not much is known about how bismuth was used in alchemy, but
        until the 18th century, it was often confused with tin and lead.
        Its symbol looks like an “8” that is open at the top.<br>

        Magnesium<br>
        Magnesium isn’t found in its pure form, so alchemists used
        magnesium carbonate (also known as “magnesium alba”) when
        conducting experiments. Because magnesium can’t be extinguished
        easily once it has been ignited, it represented eternity to
        alchemists. Several symbols can represent it; the one above is
        the most common.<br>

        Phosphorus<br>
        Phosphorus was an important element for alchemists because it
        appeared to have the ability to capture light. (When the white
        form of phosphorus oxidizes, it glows green.) It represented the
        spirit, and its symbol is typically a triangle atop a double

        Summary: Alchemy Symbols and Meanings<br>
        <br>
        Alchemy element symbols have existed for over a thousand years,
        and they were a key component of alchemy, as well as related
        fields of study such as astronomy, medicine, and philosophy.<br>
        <br>
        Each alchemy symbol corresponding to a specific element or
        compound. For example, the fire alchemy symbol looks like an
        upward-point triangle, while the alchemy earth symbol appears as
        a downward-pointing triangle bisected by a horizontal line.
        Alchemy symbols sometimes contain hints as to the properties the
        element was thought to have, as well as the history of the
        element.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
      </font><br>
      And so, because mercury is mentioned twice, those 22 are truly 21.<br>
      <br>
      but then wiki adds 3 more elements to those mudane 8:<br>

        The alchemical magnum opus was sometimes expressed as a series
        of chemical operations. In cases where these numbered twelve,
        each could be assigned one of the Zodiac signs as a form of
        cryptography. The following example can be found in Pernety's

      I find reddit-s[acing useful to highlight something important but
      why do I leave separate thoughts<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      In that list of alchemic symbols we have groups of 3, 4, 7 and who
      knows how many else.<br>
      So it's natural to ask: are 3 and 4 give 7? do they? whatever<br>
      <font size="+1">Mercury (which is also one of the seven planetary
        metals) can mean both the element and the planet.</font> says
      that maybe.<br>
      <font size="+1">The three primes, also known as the tria prima,
        were named by Paracelsus, a Swiss philosopher, in the 16th
        century. </font>tells that the three are less important than
      the 4. even though Paracelsus was a real doctor, father of
      toxicology they say, but 16th century is rather recent (I think
      the triangles are both more simple forms and more well known, more
      common, but who knows why, there could be any reason. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Paracelsus took mercury and sulfur from the chemical signs that
      existed, from the chemical knowledge that existed, ancientmost
      people probably didn't know such words, and such signs.<br>
      <br>
      Mercury could look like the thickiest water there is, it also
      doesn't burn, <br>
      While sulfur not only burns, but is used for making the
      gun-powder:<br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">Gunpowder, also known as the retronym black powder
        to distinguish it from modern smokeless powder, is the earliest
        known chemical explosive. It consists of a mixture of sulfur
        (S), carbon (C), and potassium nitrate (saltpeter, KNO3). The
        sulfur and charcoal act as fuels while the saltpeter is an
        oxidizer.[1][2] Gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant
        in firearms, artillery, rocketry, and pyrotechnics, including
        use as a blasting agent for explosives in quarrying, mining, and
        road building.<br>
        <br>
        Gunpowder was invented in 9th-century China as one of the Four
        Great Inventions, and spread throughout most parts of Eurasia by
        the end of the 13th century.[3] Originally developed by the
        Taoists for medicinal purposes, gunpowder was first used for
        warfare around 904 AD.[4] </font><br>

      such signs. they're different yet are all complex, <br>

      from of it is correct, middle form is false or wrong, the
      rightmost form is I don't know what, probably some other school or
      some other period of those signs. let's collect them here and
      compare:<br>

      Lets' try to link those planets &amp; metals to the other 3 and 4<br>
      Mercury is Mercury<br>
      Salt is Sol is Sun<br>
      Sulfur looks almost exactly like Veus<br>
      hm, that was easy, now we have moon (water) mars (fire) jupiter
      (air) and saturn (earth?) Saturn as satan opposes Jovi of Jehovi
      our heavenly father so to say. I noticed before that they oppose
      them in their graphic, they're like 2 &amp; 5 or 2 &amp; 3, which
      is more natural since there are only four. thus they probably go
      in this order: 🜂🜁🜃🜄 but suddenly I see they could be the sand
      dials, then they would be 🜄🜃🜁🜂&nbsp; <br>
      Fire stands first as mars for mardi. but mardi is tuestday, of
      two, m for mars the second letter? firs should be vowel, but it's
      lundi. l can be vowel! LMN it is then!&nbsp; but it Mercredi. N~M
      но не настолько же! Mardi Mercredi are the MM? самая середина
      недели. Jeudi is great as both lingual and vowel.<br>
      Vendredi is naturally labial, thus J is the vowel I. Saturday is
      Samedi, perfect lingual after perfect vowel. And finally dimanche
      forsunday (english has SS instead of MM, M is Mind, S is asS)<br>
      l as aleph. interesting. And naturally this order tells that
      monday is the first day, moon is used for counting days. or weeks?<br>
      Monday begins with labial in english, thus it's only natural that
      they consider Sunday the first day, but then that day has to have
      some other name, some name beginning with a vowel. But no such
      words.<br>
      And lets' check english further. If they're other culture why
      would they obey the same order? They're the same lune is moon, and
      others are believed to be synonymic. MTWTFSS SMTWTFS, no, now
      relation. No vowels at all. But labials and linguals are in the
      same rhythm. then a sincope of SS and new weed begins. Indians
      leave vowels separated from the consonants, arabs even believe
      they don't even have vowels (both lie and tortures their tongue,
      it's as if they try to be gross, to fit the looks: movie dubbers
      use for voicing the actors who are of the same type as the
      original ones, so everybody feels better being natural. But would
      some of them CHOOSE to be gross? Satanists exist and who knows
      what perversions people will try to make themselves and others?
      Future is odd indeed. Who knows where it all comes and how fast. I
      know I must do what I can to make the good future come faster than
      the bad one, so we can counterfeit the fate. Let's not misf<font

      Another interpretation can lay between those 3 &amp; 4:<br>
      Sulfur for Fire, Mercury for Water, Salt for the both signs with
      lines in the middle as the salt has.<br>
      Is NaCl EarthAir? Clorine for air because air is gas and chlorine

      Great Lavoisier used 🜔 for 🜁? Wow, I wonder why. wow is wonder
      why? maybe, but more likely that it's just my poetic
      interpretation of a totally glossolalic interjection. междометие.<br>
      <br>
      But either way it seems that only the four elements could be some
      ancient signs, all the other alchemy seems to be relatively modern
      invention. But let's not spill some children with this water. Some
      of these signs can have deep roots. Especially if I accept into
      the consideration the signs for four elements.<br>
      <br>
      For example, this story with the 🜔, Lavoisier could know three
      mothers like 🜂🜔🜄 but then if mercury goes first for a reason,
      🜄🜔🜂. ΔeV &amp; VeΔ? ΛeV &amp; VeΛ?<br>
      Dev &amp; Ved I like much more. because why not to use the exactly
      triangle symbol whence I have one. I would use a letter formed as
      🜄 if I knew one, but V is the closest to it.<br>
      Also that sublime difference between V &amp; 🜂 make them more
      distinct. water is open, fire closes opening. <br>
      <br>
      🜔 instead of 🜁 (somehow going first in that list, who knows why,
      it's in the same order in unicode) may say that he took solids
      more precisely (probably because it's easier to work with a powder
      than with gas. You don't even know if the gas is going to be
      lighter or havier than air. After the first experiment you maybe
      can, or if you read the theoretic grimoirs on alchemy, you
      probably could. I'm only guessing. I conclude it because of 🜔
      being used as 🜁 and not 🜃<br>
      <br>
      It's
🜀🜁🜂🜃🜄🜅🜆🜇🜈🜉🜊🜋🜌🜍🜎🜏🜐🜑🜒🜓🜔🜕🜖🜗🜘🜙🜚🜛🜜🜝🜞🜟🜠🜡🜢🜣🜤🜥🜦🜧🜨🜩🜪🜫🜬🜭🜮🜯🜰🜱🜲🜳🜴<br>
      🜵🜶🜷🜸🜹🜺🜻🜼🜽🜾🜿🝀🝁🝂🝃🝄🝅🝆🝇🝈🝉🝊🝋🝌🝍🝎🝏🝐🝑🝒🝓🝔🝕🝖🝗🝘🝙🝚🝛🝜🝝🝞🝟🝠🝡🝢🝣🝤🝥🝦🝧🝨🝩🝪🝫🝬🝭🝮🝯🝰🝱🝲🝳🝴🝵🝶🝷🝸🝹🝺🝻🝼🝽🝾🝿in






      the unicode and it's 🜁🜃🜂🜄 where I found it first (who knows
      where) so it's double weird. 🜁 is always the first of those four.
      As if it's A, Air, Vowels are Air indeed, as Sefer Yetzirah does
      tell, I dared to argue, insolent kid!<br>
      🜂 for the second is very eastern: ki for fire, k as the first
      consonanant (k &amp; s &amp; ant<font color="#cccccc">er</font>)<br>
      And allow me to guess that the unicode for alchemy was made in the
      east (if it's not, what does it disprove? it just cannot become an
      illustration to what I say. But 🜃 after A doesn't make much
      sense. 🜄 would be perfect second letter, and I looed for
      "🜁🜄🜃🜂" and found some girl named Vesta <font color="#cccccc">(I

        used to give a surname, but decided why would people who look
        for her find my page instead, so nah, especially since she's not
        a specialist, so what's the point) </font>so I registered for a
      consultation with her, I will ask her if she placed those signs
      arbitrary or by some book or other reason. She could place female
      triangles inside the male ones to feel protected, I think it's one
      of her ideas, the protection or the feeling of that. And she just
      answered saying that it just felt right. <font color="#999999">I
        literally jumped out at some random gal, I told you my
        communication skill is not what I mastered.</font><br>
      I think it was only natural, that "🜁🜄🜂🜃" had more finds,
      because it's a more consistent zigzag and 🜄🜂 are in the middle
      and it also makes more sense as an alphabetic sequence because of
      that, because of 🜂 is similar to 𐤂 (that's Г, and once again <i>c
        ~ l</i>, ג~λ.<br>
      and 🜃 is similar to Д, especially in some archaic form of it.<br>
      So I will ask that girl, or will I teach her what sequence is
      right, because I think I figured it out, but I have scheduled the
      consulation already, so we'll see what it may bring. what else am
      I to do that evening anyway. 🜃 is terra. Didn't I compare these
      signs to abcd before? I think I did, I will see when I sort these
      notes by topics.<br>
      so is 🜄 this much similar to 🜃, just as b is similar to d,
      epecially in roman cursive.<br>
      is 🜃 a half of 🜄? because ᚦ could be of ᛒ.<br>
      🜁🜄🜂🜃 because c is already lingual, and if Δ is 🜃 then is it a
      form of 🜄? I don't understand. Because I just thought that 🜂 is
      lingual (языки пламени) and 🜃 is some other form of lingual, as
      if that line is the teeth, then V also needs teeth, and are vowels
      labial? because lips seem to distinguish o from a and i, but wait
      a minute, they're different triangles. Is it some code to confuse
      the profans? provence, provincials? Because it's too much to work
      out since it's not V with the dash but the A.<br>
      This 🜁🜄🜂🜃 hypothesis is shaky as a card house they even
      remind. One guess upon another. <br>
      But it's funny, they do remind AVΔe maybe? I recognized 🜔 as e,
      and even though it was 🜁 in Lavoisier's, why not consider 🜃 e
      when it fits, especially because 🜔 seems to be common sum of 🜁
      and 🜃, when I recognized them as Na and Cl. So is 🜃 e or d?
      vowel or lingual? earth is solid, it would be natural Д, even
      natural T, as Terra. but E for Earth also works. and then 🜔 could
      be not ☉ but ⊕. Or is it something inbetween? Okay, I'm thoroughly
      confused, I will return to this some other day.<br>
      No, I'm not. water removes gas? I'm not sure about that, but
      further it comes more consequent.. no, it doesn't. water removes
      fire, not the other way around, and fire eats solids. and solids
      remove air? I don't know by that sequence can go both ways, I
      think here's how it goes:<br>
      <br>

      Here I found a good diagram: sun, air, ocean, rock. 🜂🜁🜄🜃<br>

      french ехал in russian. z is r in vietnamese, carrot is cà rốt (cà

      Once again, 🜁🜄🜂🜃 is the most alphabetic representation,

      🜁🜄🜂🜃 when it is alphabet is open at least in the first two
      letters: A V and only so. 🜂 can be both Λ(L) 𐤂(c) but also Δ(d)
      but because A &amp; V are open.. can they be followed by the two
      closed? because even though 🜂 can be both Λ, 𐤂 and some c-like <i>L</i><br>
      , how would I open 🜃? It is great as both Д and Ⱚ, both are final
      in their lines. why would e be in the line where A were. abcd. d

      🜂 is both c, l d, t and graphically they are close, but I was
      compaing majuscule forms of theirs (not t, t is just because of d,
      but it resonates l not less than d resonates c, both are the same

      It is some notation predating mendeleev table, which didn't
      integrate these triangles and circles, Because of C for carbon?
      because I saw that four elements can be drawn by different
      rotation of an angle, ant this is very similar: if ɔ was not
      hydrogen, but oxygen, I would get very exited, but alas Oxygen is

      The main difference between russia and america: russia brings to
      those nations weapons, americans have to go there with all their
      weapon and to help the government pacify those armed pro-rusian
      forces. Russia has no other business to place bases in their
      countries, only after the weapon they use will cause conflict
      large enough so they have to help prorussian forces, the forces
      they usually send weapon for or to.&nbsp; Russia sends weapon,
      because they cannot do anything else well. How so? So. They are
      military force of the jewish puppetteers? In that crazy point of
      view, yes. Jews are some force, but to attribute everything to
      them is not correct, they play like snakes (bible teaches of the
      wise snake) wise is white (whether european (not caucasian, fuck
      that jewish psy-op, they're not white enough. How do I know? Many
      jews are quite white. But why this caucasian meme? Because it's a

      would be less white than them, no caucasus nation I konw of today

      watashi is chinese wa, vietnamese ta, some other nation's shi. <br>
      Та &amp; she are synonyms in russian and english. <br>
      Русские имют тва слова для she: она и та. И именно та используется
      в виде суффикса: делает (та)<br>
      делают has plural eiy её? делаю has io as its suffix, becaues that
      verb tells I do. делают прибавляет к этому слову форму
      множественного числа, т.е. по самой грамматической форме можно
      видеть семантику. <br>
      Ta is not exactly vietnamese, because according to google they say
      Toy, but a friend who came out of Veitnam tells that it's Ta. Той
      is genetivus of Та in russian. Та is she in russian. And it is
      another example of pronouns' antonymy.<br>
      <br>
      Wa Ta She could be Me Thee She or Me They She or She could be
      taken from some other language where all these three were I I I.
      in a form understood to everybody. Immediate translation of the
      speech could be considered polite. And thus shorter forms, Wa is a
      japanese word for I. The same as in china, with some akanie
      dialect. <br>

      Are these neuronets unweaving our language? Because what human
      would translate that honorific o as go? only some neuronet,
      comparing russian <font color="#cccccc">судаль </font>сударь и
      государь. And russian seems to translate japanese after it is
      translated into english, because it translate that honorific as
      идти, and I wonder if that could be the case. I maybe have to find
      a language after which it is translated into english? I think
      english is the basal language of google, because in dutch it's not

      y stands exactly where next vowel would be in the 4-letter-line.

      <br>
      <font size="+1">The Ametsuchi no Uta (天地の歌) or Ametsuchi no Kotoba
        (天地の詞) is a Japanese pangram, authored in the 9th century AD,
        which is credited as being the oldest perfect pangram in the
        Japanese language. Its name roughly translates to "Song (or
        Words) of the Universe".<br>

      What a poor poetry they had in 9th century.<br>
      Iroha is much better, but it's reported to be of later origin: <font
        size="+1">Authorship is traditionally ascribed to the Heian era
        Japanese Buddhist priest and scholar Kūkai (空海) (774–835).
        However, this is unlikely as it is believed that in his time
        there were separate e sounds in the a and ya columns of the kana
        table. The え (e) above would have been pronounced ye, making the
        pangram incomplete<br>
      </font>So it could be that Kūkai wrote that first silly pangram,
      and iroha is by an unknown author.<font size="+1"><br>

      вопрос: можно ли будет снять это напряжение не механическим, но
      электромагнитными средствами? Можно снять его лишь один раз или
      сама кристаллическая решётка будет генерировать это напряжение?
      Если она будет стремиться высосать его из электрической сети
      обратно? может отсюда происходит переменный ток, который
      использует стартовые процессы, когда значение максимально. нам
      чители лекцию об этом, но я её не помню, помню лишь скачок даже не
      уверен чего, напряжения наверное, когда систему включают. ударные

      opqrst is definitely similar to ufhtschshsche..<br>
      russians just unfolded it, then ъыь are where uvw are, and uvw is
      more like ьъы which would be naturel, from the simplest form to
      the most diverse. uvw is followed by xyz. ъыь are followed with
      эюя and z shares button with я, and ю is similarmost to y,

      Я is similar to R and er may sound as Я or Sha in japanese, j is
      both y and dж эгэйн. R is read as Ж and З in china and vietnam.<br>

      Do east asians know our letters long before missionaries? What if
      they know them sometimes better than we do, uderstanding that

      in russian it's ч, tsch, ch.<br>
      In latin they don't draw <i>r</i> as much deep as it is here, but
      neither do russians, they draw cursive <i>ч</i> directly as
      european write r (italic doesn't cursive it)<br>

          related to dogs. Did they make new breeds such as boxers
          mating dogs with australian sea lions? and those beasts have
          much more fur than walruses, who lost feather penguins still
          had, but some усы are not exactly fur so far. Penguins have
          feather and their hands are even less than walruses have. but
          between penguins and walruses are seals? No, seals have fur.
          Seal could be a descender of walrus, because walrus almost
          have no fur. and on some photos they very maybe do. and a
          mouth of mustaches as of whale, the baleen. <br>

        It looks like see animals have all their fur on the inside. Is
        it how we're different? some of us turned itself inside out.<br>
        And would lingua turn into lingam? And would some inner organ of
        which we don't even know is face and mouth of the new, inverted,
        entity? Is it like caterpillar and a butterfly? <br>
        &nbsp;I don't know, I think eyes were always eys, but what do I

        <font size="+1">When we think of whales, hair is not usually
          something that comes to mind – but most whales and dolphins
          have some hair when they are born, and certain species keep
          their hair throughout their life! ... There is one notable
          exception – the Amazon river dolphin, which has stiff hairs
          along its snout throughout its life.</font> But I look at them
        and I just don't see any fur. and hair in the mouth too, only
        some sharp tiny teeth.<br>
        Why is this whale serie even here. I'm sorry I got carried away,
        but I included chemistry and other stuff, and I just wanted to
        see what китовый ус is, у джека лондоа он был скручиваем, но
        упругим, можно было закатать в жировой шарик и заморозить в нём.
        Не знаю правда ли это, но наверное он бы не стал считаться
        великим писателем если бы его могли высмеять за нелепую выдумку,
        наверное это на самом деле было антропологическое наблюдение. <br>
        Зачем я вообще завёл речь про дельфинов? где дельфины и где
        алфавит. Пингвины не дельфины, ины, мифины?<br>
        Just to close the topic of Jack London, here a whale seems to be
        looking upside down, on his back, and you can see those hair
        separately, and they could be both rolled into a ball and frozen
        in lard and they would be painful in a stomach.<br>

      tanka is 57577 (is it some censored song? some incompete song?
      some rhythmically modified song? because 57577 can be sang
      perfectly and with the coda it looks finished. repetition
      legitimizes musical solutions, if you can rhyme it you probably
      had that very word in mind for some time to see and not to make a

      Look if it's in manyogana. In iroha o's 於, in manyogana too. That

      You remember one poem, you remember how to draw it and you're good
      to go.<br>
      Did it create kana itself? When you knew how to write down any
      text, only with mistakes at first. But your mistakes will be
      readable, man instead of ma, and then it become a standard. your
      rather arbitrary (not yours, but of who created the hiragana
      katakana) <br>
      <br>
      If the origin of hiragana katakana is in some iroha, in this
      iroha, then they are correct that hiragana katakana are about a
      millenium old. <br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">Hiragana developed from man'yōgana, Chinese
        characters used for their pronunciations, a practice that
        started in the 5th century.[17] The oldest examples of
        Man'yōgana include the Inariyama Sword, an iron sword excavated
        at the Inariyama Kofun in 1968. This sword is thought to be made
        in the year 辛亥年 (most commonly taken to be A.D. 471).[18] The
        forms of the hiragana originate from the cursive script style of
        Chinese calligraphy. The figure below shows the derivation of
        hiragana from manyōgana via cursive script. The upper part shows
        the character in the regular script form, the center character
        in red shows the cursive script form of the character, and the
        bottom shows the equivalent hiragana. The cursive script forms
        are not strictly confined to those in the illustration. </font><br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">Katakana was developed in the 9th century (during
        the early Heian period) by Buddhist monks in Nara by taking
        parts of man'yōgana characters as a form of shorthand, hence
        this kana is so-called kata (片, "partial, fragmented"). For
        example, ka (カ) comes from the left side of ka (加, lit.
        "increase", but the original meaning is no longer applicable to
        kana). The adjacent table shows the origins of each katakana:
        the red markings of the original Chinese character (used as
        man'yōgana) eventually became each corresponding symbol.[10]<br>
        Early on, katakana was almost exclusively used by men for
        official text and text imported from China.[11]<br>
        Official documents of the Empire of Japan were written
        exclusively with kyūjitai and katakana. </font><br>

      Some signs are different: O is the same, but A is different.<br>
      And iroha uses the A of katakana. So here two accounts of the same
      event: <br>

      in kana:<br>
      いろはにほへと<br>
      ちりぬるを<br>
      わかよたれそ<br>
      つねならむ<br>
      うゐのおくやま<br>
      けふこえて<br>
      あさきゆめみし<br>
      ゑひもせす　京（ん）<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      in kanji:<br>
      色は匂へど<br>
      散りぬるを<br>
      わが世　誰ぞ<br>
      常ならむ<br>
      宇井（有為）の奥山<br>
      今日越えて<br>
      浅き夢見し<br>
      酔いもせず　京（ん）<br>
      <br>
      浅 they use here is shallow. but sounds is asa, and that is
      morning. in other sign. and shallow and morning can be
      semantically connected, and thus etymologically too.<br>
      <br>
      Can that asa be combined from the other two signs they actually
      used in iroha?<br>
      <br>
      阿佐 is recognized as asa, but they don't seem to be used in the
      modern japanese like this. nobody can translate them together. 阿
      is literally A, the letter and abbreviation for different A's as
      for Africa, aho begins with that a, and ho is 呆 and is stupid
      enough to be translated as stupid. <br>
      and 佐 is recognized as sa, but also as help. maybe because suke is
      assist, but maybe by some other cause.<br>
      <br>
      So it only shows how complicated is the question of the japanese
      writing system, and I still think that that cursive fasthand was
      used in chinese as phonetic record too. And japanese monks only
      borrowed it. I used to say japanese kana is as ancient as the
      european alphabets. I don't know how old are those alphabets, I
      don't work in the dating stuff, and so I don't know, I just
      research it by formal basis and there I see that 阿 does look like
      A and also like bot, and it's ironic that that very β-like shape
      was used for katakanic α.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;is 以呂 in iroha, and 以 is to, with, by, according to, in
      order to, so as to, because, use.<br>
      呂 is only recognized as Lu in both chinese and even japanese. What
      was Ro is Lu now? Or is it how ai hears japanee Ro? R and L is the
      same sound in japanese, and o and u are very close.<br>
      <br>
      It is really interesting: https://jisho.org/search/%E5%91%82<br>

      молодень? дурной дурень это да не ой и ай и ый, но ной и най и
      ный, он is short form of оный. она is short form of оная. т.о.
      these pronouns are originally adjectives.<br>
      <br>
      он она оно они это прилагательные вместо суффиксальных местоимений
      его её их<br>
      <br>
      она can aso be suffix in белена, зелена, because белен и зелен
      тоже могут быть суффиксом он, но давай проверим эту гипотезу:
      белена белену (вместо белеё, ещё раз, она он оно они - это не
      суффиксы, но прилагательные.<br>
      а что тогда за суффикс на ны не ну ной о_не (похоже, что
      предложный падеж это форма дательного. дательный с предлогом,
      потому и предложный. но для белены не предложный падеж, а
      родительный, так что ещё и не все предлоги, дурацкий падеж. давай
      найдём предложный не в форме дательного:<font color="#cccccc">.</font>.<br>
      во множественном числе не дательный а особенный<br>
      ны н нам ны/н нами о_нах.<br>
      Удивительно, как во множественном числе винительный падеж
      совпадает то ли с именительным то ли с родительным (в зависимости
      от диалекта наверное) а в единственном предложный с дательным (у
      единственного числа нет вариантов, предлагают значит дают. А во
      множественном числе винят либо по имени либо по матери.<br>
      <br>
      о нах как о нас? ны как мы? временам - нам, головам - вам.<br>
      Суффикс тот же что и у этих местоимений, что это за местоимения,?:<br>
      ны и вы? н и в? Н~M (that's misleading kirillic script, that Н is
      N, N~M because almost all forms of that Мы is with N: Мы is only
      in the Nominativus, others are Nas, Nam, Nas, Nami, Nas -
      especially if we remember that first wone is pure Мы, the cases
      suffixes seem to чередовать m &amp; s (and remember that both
      words could be written by M and Ϻ if they don't lie, they seem to
      insist, I seem to have seen the proof of it or a good illustration
      of it, I don't know how much next to B~C it is.<br>
      <br>
      В случае с суффиксами существительных, грамматические флексии
      отличаются:<br>
      <br>
      белый белен <br>
      белого беленого<br>
      thus белен is just a short form of белый, бел, with attached
      suffix own (both in phonetic and semantic)<br>
      белому белёному<br>
      белого белёного<br>
      белым белёным<br>
      о белом о белёном<br>

      О чём я говорю? Эти окончания - суффисы, только не первого лица, а
      третьего.<br>

      и насколько)<br>

      Further investigation of comparing numerals to european culture
      made me question the validity of my comparisons, because am I not

      level, so why not 4 or 5. three mothers are common an the rest is
      all combinations of them (三&nbsp; shows that you can combine 二 and
      一. But then why do these common principles use different words for
      them? because different meanings were translated in different
      languages. maybe, keep digging. We took hieroglyphic signs for
      letters, we took their reading without knownin all the language,
      we bastardized the chinese hieroglyphs <br>

      I M N as they're given in chinese unicode are 一&nbsp;&nbsp; 三

      I M N are definitely three mothers, and the third one is in the

      I is aye. N is нe. <br>
      I is ええ[e] (ай is хай)<br>
      N is いいえ [ie] (ne is nai)<br>
      doubling of vowels is to show their length, long i in ie and long
      e in e. But semantically what matters is 1 vowel is yes, 2 vowels
      is no. 一 as Ies (yeah is e), N as No (futa is фу, бу, boo, as in

      what they are. My first guess is those are names of some ancient

        Middle English kēpen, from late Old English cepan (past tense

        from Proto-Germanic *kopjan, which is of uncertain origin. Old
        English cepan was used c. 1000 to render Latin observare, so
        perhaps it is related to Old English capian "to look" (from
        Proto-Germanic *kap-), which would make the basic sense "to keep

      I will figure it out later, but now see, I have three japanese

      would be abc.. opq..<br>
      abg they say it was, which directly reflected opq then r is

      Почему я вообще решил что русский принцип гласные вперёд
      универсален. Потому что когда вспомнил что говорят что С была
      звонкой, а затем звонкая с точкой стала, а без точки глухая.<br>
      А сейчас вижу что их гласными обозвал, звонкие эти, и естественно
      же что когда гласная сочетается с согласной получается звонкая.
      Т.о. ABC is more basic principle: B is the combination of A &amp;
      C. or A &amp; D? ABD. <br>
      ᛒ is ᚦ and ᚹ? not w, was alef w? w is also sorta vowel, and more
      likely to give B in the result, but w..<br>

      in some 10% of those cases.<br>
      And I see that those examples do repeat the singnoten in this
      chart. Г is not E, only from some modern tradition do they look
      similar, because they are at the same line. And that sign Г's note
      has is not diez but bekar, бекар, natural.<br>
      <br>
      And suddenly I see that song's diapason, and I see that the
      records are in different key:<br>

        height="315"><br>
      The one in the treble clef should be raised several tones up to
      the ♭♭♭ (or rather we have to lower ♭♭♭ those several lines) and
      the one in the bass clef should be lowered at few lines too (see
      the F which is final here, but only in the middle of the whole
      diapason or is range the word)<br>
      <br>

      Here tonal sequence is ZIKOCФХ𝈫 or something.<br>
      This comparison of two system shows that greek music was much more
      microtonal than our, or is it why vowels are told to be sung and
      they're at some good range from one another. Let's select those
      vowels:<br>
      <img src="10_files/278_first_half_vowels.png" alt="" width="758"
        height="248"><br>
      As you can see, distance between vowels is large enough to
      consider them some normal pentatonic scale. Only those additional
      signs Η &amp; Ω don't make much sense: distance between Η and Ι is
      minimal and actually the distance between Υ and Ω is the same as
      between Α and Ε, who seem to share the same line (with all the BCD
      between them, and yet A is higher by that diez. which is a
      distance between D &amp; E in modern scale. Don't Hs differ from
      those Is in that very semitone? What am I talking about? <br>
