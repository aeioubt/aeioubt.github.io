      I don't know what those ten long cylindrical things is, because 十本
      is just ten books, so I searching for images of 十本 I wonder if
      it's an ai playing 十本 recognize those ten scrolls like this or
      does it have some ancient reference.<br>

      Let's just directly compare chinese signs to alphabetic ones, and
      we'll find the common ground:<br>
      <br>
      一 is i<br>
      十 is t<br>
      these are simple.<br>
      大 is probably ligature ta, but it's not for sure.<br>

        is m<br>
        (it's because i ni mi are 1 2 3 in japanese, even though they
        say ichi ni san, ichi nichi mitsu would probably be recognized.
        the reason I make such long comment on it is that ichi is hitsu,
        closely related to the sun, sun is one. un. is it where san
        letter comes? s+nasal. both S &amp; M are She and Me.<br>
        (even though I'm a guy, not the guy who invented language, gal
        it was, they speak more than us))<br>
        五 is G (because of japanese go, I declare that japanese were the
        first literari in there, chinese only usurped them for
        centuries, during which they stole their achievements and
        declared them their own. I am a wicked man, don't I affraid to
        be burnt as a witch? Beware, my dear, you are way too bold. So I
        get intimidated and I mention again, that it's only a hypothetic
        pondering, I dare to touch all the possibilities, and this is a
        one of them hanging in the air of my speculations.<br>
        八 is H<br>
        and it could reveal some numeral order, where 8 followed 5, as
        if it was of those 147 258 369 square.<br>
        then F would be 2 and I think we said that 2 is n. ngh? n as ν?<br>
        f as in futa, another way to pronounce 二<br>
        FGH 二五八<br>
        and because F is digamma,<br>
        一 is also Г and thus i ~ c.<br>
        c as the first letter? are you sure? Ϸϸ is supposed to be the
        first letter, because it's only natural that 1 comes before 2,
        so thus ᚦ comes before ᛒ<br>
        and if ᚦ is θ then isn't it Θ and isn't it ☉ and when I was
        looking for that sign, I found this:<br>
        <font size="+1">Salt represented the body 🜔</font><br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_symbol"><img
            src="10_files/alchemical_symbols.png" alt="" border="0"
            width="896" height="488"></a><br>
        <font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sulfur represented the soul
          (the emotions and desires) 🜍<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercury represented the spirit
          (imagination, moral judgment, and the higher mental faculties)
          ☿ <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Salt represented the body 🜔</font><br>
        I'm pretty sure these signs and all this alchemic theory can
        tell a lot to this research, because it's magic, and magic is
        ancient. not as ancient as the nature, but ancient nevertheless,
        or actually a little less. Or maybe not, who knows, if we
        consider it taking roots in the basics of nature itself, maybe
        before what we call the nature itself.<br>
        Those four 🜔🜕🜖🜗 are what I would study the first. They seem
        very fundamental in their graphic part, and I don't even
        understand what the other three out of the four are.<br>
        🜀 is aether, it is awesome and also shows that it's much newer
        than those 🜁🜂🜃🜄<br>
        I believe that sign is ae, but why does it look like qe? <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I think I found myself a reason to study japanese by learning
        this crazy song:<br>

        But this anime explains it perfectly or it rather resonates it

        I also wonder why do they have two different fonts for の and why
        does it appear so big, when upstairs, the second sign of the
        most of those blocks, it is tidily tiny. この is tiny, but once
        you remove the こ, の becomes large like this. wild thang.<br>

      This phenomenon alone could cause animosity of theirs towards

      Mercury salt and sulfur are three primes in alchemy, so they may
      be related to the three mothers.<br>
      I take it from https://blog.prepscholar.com/alchemy-symbols and
      though the image there seems to be some artistic fantasy, I copy
      the text here, because if it's true, it probably relate to the
      alphabets directly, because of the number, 22, as many as letters
      are there in hebrew alphabet.<br>

        22 Alchemy Symbols and Their Meanings<br>
        <br>
        Below are the four main groups of alchemy element symbols, along
        with their meanings.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The Three Primes<br>
        <br>
        The three primes, also known as the tria prima, were named by
        Paracelsus, a Swiss philosopher, in the 16th century. He
        believed the tria prima contained all the poisons that caused
        disease, and that by studying them, alchemists could learn how
        to cure disease. He also believed the tria prima defined humans,
        and he assigned each of the elements to a different part of the
        human identity.<br>
        &nbsp;</font><br>
      <font size="+1"><big>
          <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
            charset=UTF-8">
        </big></font>☿<font size="+1"><br>
        Mercury (which is also one of the seven planetary metals) can
        mean both the element and the planet. In either case, this
        alchemy symbol represents the mind, as well as a state that
        could transcend death. In ancient times, mercury was known as
        quicksilver, and it was believed to be able to shift between
        liquid and solid states. Therefore, in alchemy, mercury was
        believed to shift between life and death.<br>
        Mercury is often represented by a serpent/snake, and its symbol
        is said to resemble a cosmic womb. Mercury is also sometimes
        said to represent the passive female principle, as well as
        wetness and cold. You can see the standard “female” sign within
        its symbol.<br>
      </font><br>
      🜔<font size="+1"><br>
        Salt is now known to be a chemical compound comprised of sodium
        and chloride, but alchemists believed it was a single element.
        Salt represents the body, as well as physical matter in general,
        crystallization, and condensation. Salt is often impure when
        first collected, but through chemical processes it can be
        dissolved and purified, which some alchemists compared to
        purification processes the human body can undergo. Its symbol is
        a circle bisected by a horizontal line.<br>
      </font><br>
      🜍<font size="+1"><br>
        Sulfur, also known as brimstone, is the active male counterpart
        to mercury’s passive female representation. In antiquity, it was
        used as traditional medicine in places ranging from China to
        Egypt to Europe. It’s mentioned in both the Torah and the Bible,
        the latter of which states that Hell smells like sulfur.<br>
        Sulfur represents properties such as dryness, heat, and
        masculinity. In alchemy, it could also represent evaporation,
        expansion, and dissolution. In terms of human body, it
        represented the soul. In terms of the tria prima, sulfur was
        seen as the middling element connecting salt (high) and mercury
        (low).<br>
        Sulfur’s symbol is typically a triangle atop a Greek cross (seen
        above), but it can also be represented by a Cross of Loraine
        atop an ouroboros/infinity symbol. This symbol has come to be
        known as Satan’s Cross and is sometimes used as a satanic
        symbol.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The Four Classical Elements<br>
        <br>
        The Classical Elements are based on the ancient Greek belief
        that air, earth, fire, and water composed all matter in the
        world. Unlike many of the other elements in this guide, these
        four aren’t elements you can find on the periodic table, but
        alchemists believed to have significant powers, as well as the
        ability to create new elements.<br>
        <br>
        Medieval Arab alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan was one of the first to
        connect the four elements to alchemy, but the classical elements
        were well-studied in ancient Greece before that. The ancient
        Greek physician Hippocrates connected each to one of the four
        humours of the human body, while Aristotle connected each to a
        principle of heat/cold and dryness/moisture.<br>
      </font><font size="+1"></font><br>
      🜁<font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
          </font></font>Air</font><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
        </font>Aristotle stated that air represented heat and wetness
        (the wetness is from water vapor, which was thought to be part
        of air). The air symbol in alchemy can also represent a
        life-giving force, and it is associated with the colors white
        and blue. Hippocrates associated air with blood. Air’s symbol is
        an upward triangle bisected by a horizontal line, and you might
        notice it is the Earth symbol, inverted.<br>
      </font><br>
      🜃<font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
          </font></font>Earth</font><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
        </font>Aristotle labeled Earth as cold and dry. Earth can
        represent physical movements and sensations, and it’s associated
        with the colors green and brown, and the humor black bile.
        Earth’s symbol is the inverse of air’s: a downward-point
        triangle bisected by a horizontal line.<br>
      </font><br>
      🜂<font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
        </font>Fire<br>
        In alchemy, fire represents emotions such as passion, love,
        anger, and hate, which are sometimes referred to as “fiery”
        emotions. Aristotle labeled it as hot and dry, and it is
        represented by the colors red and orange, as well as the humor
        yellow bile. Additionally, fire is also seen as a more masculine
        symbol. The fire alchemy symbol is an upward-pointing triangle.<br>
        &nbsp;</font><br>
      🜄<font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
        </font>Water<br>
        Aristotle labeled water as cold and wet, and Hippocrates
        connected it to the body humor phlegm. Additionally, it’s
        associated with intuition as well as the color blue, and is
        often linked to the alchemy symbol of mercury (as both are seen
        as feminine symbols). The Greek philosopher Thales believed
        water was the first substance created in the world.<br>
        As another contrast to fire, the water alchemy symbol is the
        inverse of the fire symbol; a downward-point triangle. This
        symbol is sometimes said to resemble containers for holding
        water, such as a cup or urn.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The Seven Planetary Metals<br>
        <br>
        Each of these elements is a metal, and they are each connected
        to a celestial object, as well as a day of the week and an organ
        in the body. Astronomy was a major part of early alchemy, and
        during the classical era, each planet was thought to “rule” over
        its associated metal, with its position in the sky and proximity
        to other planets affecting the metal’s properties.<br>
        <br>
        You might notice that Uranus and Neptune aren’t included; that’s
        because these symbols were created before telescopes were
        invented, and thus only planets visible to the naked eye were
        known to exist.<br>
        <br>

      ♄<font size="+1"><font size="+1"><font size="+1"><br>
          </font></font>Lead<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day of the week: Saturday<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organ: Spleen<br>
        <br>
        Lead (known as plumbum in classical times) has a symbol known as
        a “crescent below the cross,” and it looks similar to a scythe
        or a stylized “h” with a cross on top.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organ: Liver<br>
        <br>
        Tin’s symbol is known as a “crescent below the cross,” and it
        looks like a stylized “4”.<br>
      </font><br>
      <font size="+1"><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day of the week: Tuesday<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organ: Gallbladder<br>
        <br>
        The “male” symbol often used to represent the planet Mars is the
        alchemy symbol for iron.<br>

        Gold represented perfection, and it was one of the most
        prominent symbols in alchemy. A key (and unfulfilled) goal of
        many alchemists was to learn how to turn lead into gold. Two
        symbols can represent the gold alchemy symbol. The first looks
        like a stylized sun with rays emitted from it, and the second is
        a circle with a dot in its center.<br>

        Silver’s alchemy symbol looks like a crescent moon, the same way

        Mundane Elements<br>
        <br>
        The mundane elements make up the rest of the elements used in
        alchemy. They are typically more recent additions to alchemy,
        and they don’t have as long a history as some of the other
        elements. As a result, less information is known about their
        alchemy symbols and what they represent, although all were used
        by alchemists at some point.<br>

        Antimony represents the wild/animalistic parts of human nature.
        Antimony’s symbol is a circle with a cross above it (or the

        as a wolf.<br>

        Arsenic<br>
        In alchemy, arsenic is often represented by a swan or swans.
        This is because, as a metalloid, arsenic is capable of
        transforming its physical appearance (a metallic-gray solid or a
        yellow crystalline solid), the same way a cygnet transforms into
        a swan. Its symbol is a pair of overlapping triangles.<br>

        Bismuth<br>
        Not much is known about how bismuth was used in alchemy, but
        until the 18th century, it was often confused with tin and lead.
        Its symbol looks like an “8” that is open at the top.<br>

        Magnesium<br>
        Magnesium isn’t found in its pure form, so alchemists used
        magnesium carbonate (also known as “magnesium alba”) when
        conducting experiments. Because magnesium can’t be extinguished
        easily once it has been ignited, it represented eternity to
        alchemists. Several symbols can represent it; the one above is
        the most common.<br>

        Phosphorus<br>
        Phosphorus was an important element for alchemists because it
        appeared to have the ability to capture light. (When the white
        form of phosphorus oxidizes, it glows green.) It represented the
        spirit, and its symbol is typically a triangle atop a double

        Summary: Alchemy Symbols and Meanings<br>
        <br>
        Alchemy element symbols have existed for over a thousand years,
        and they were a key component of alchemy, as well as related
        fields of study such as astronomy, medicine, and philosophy.<br>
        <br>
        Each alchemy symbol corresponding to a specific element or
        compound. For example, the fire alchemy symbol looks like an
        upward-point triangle, while the alchemy earth symbol appears as
        a downward-pointing triangle bisected by a horizontal line.
        Alchemy symbols sometimes contain hints as to the properties the
        element was thought to have, as well as the history of the
        element.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
      </font><br>
      And so, because mercury is mentioned twice, those 22 are truly 21.<br>
      <br>
      but then wiki adds 3 more elements to those mudane 8:<br>

        The alchemical magnum opus was sometimes expressed as a series
        of chemical operations. In cases where these numbered twelve,
        each could be assigned one of the Zodiac signs as a form of
        cryptography. The following example can be found in Pernety's

      I find reddit-s[acing useful to highlight something important but
      why do I leave separate thoughts<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      In that list of alchemic symbols we have groups of 3, 4, 7 and who
      knows how many else.<br>
      So it's natural to ask: are 3 and 4 give 7? do they? whatever<br>
      <font size="+1">Mercury (which is also one of the seven planetary
        metals) can mean both the element and the planet.</font> says
      that maybe.<br>
      <font size="+1">The three primes, also known as the tria prima,
        were named by Paracelsus, a Swiss philosopher, in the 16th
        century. </font>tells that the three are less important than
      the 4. even though Paracelsus was a real doctor, father of
      toxicology they say, but 16th century is rather recent (I think
      the triangles are both more simple forms and more well known, more
      common, but who knows why, there could be any reason. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Paracelsus took mercury and sulfur from the chemical signs that
      existed, from the chemical knowledge that existed, ancientmost
      people probably didn't know such words, and such signs.<br>
      <br>
      Mercury could look like the thickiest water there is, it also
      doesn't burn, <br>
      While sulfur not only burns, but is used for making the
      gun-powder:<br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">Gunpowder, also known as the retronym black powder
        to distinguish it from modern smokeless powder, is the earliest
        known chemical explosive. It consists of a mixture of sulfur
        (S), carbon (C), and potassium nitrate (saltpeter, KNO3). The
        sulfur and charcoal act as fuels while the saltpeter is an
        oxidizer.[1][2] Gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant
        in firearms, artillery, rocketry, and pyrotechnics, including
        use as a blasting agent for explosives in quarrying, mining, and
        road building.<br>
        <br>
        Gunpowder was invented in 9th-century China as one of the Four
        Great Inventions, and spread throughout most parts of Eurasia by
        the end of the 13th century.[3] Originally developed by the
        Taoists for medicinal purposes, gunpowder was first used for
        warfare around 904 AD.[4] </font><br>

      such signs. they're different yet are all complex, <br>

      from of it is correct, middle form is false or wrong, the
      rightmost form is I don't know what, probably some other school or
      some other period of those signs. let's collect them here and
      compare:<br>

      Lets' try to link those planets &amp; metals to the other 3 and 4<br>
      Mercury is Mercury<br>
      Salt is Sol is Sun<br>
      Sulfur looks almost exactly like Veus<br>
      hm, that was easy, now we have moon (water) mars (fire) jupiter
      (air) and saturn (earth?) Saturn as satan opposes Jovi of Jehovi
      our heavenly father so to say. I noticed before that they oppose
      them in their graphic, they're like 2 &amp; 5 or 2 &amp; 3, which
      is more natural since there are only four. thus they probably go
      in this order: 🜂🜁🜃🜄 but suddenly I see they could be the sand
      dials, then they would be 🜄🜃🜁🜂&nbsp; <br>
      Fire stands first as mars for mardi. but mardi is tuestday, of
      two, m for mars the second letter? firs should be vowel, but it's
      lundi. l can be vowel! LMN it is then!&nbsp; but it Mercredi. N~M
      но не настолько же! Mardi Mercredi are the MM? самая середина
      недели. Jeudi is great as both lingual and vowel.<br>
      Vendredi is naturally labial, thus J is the vowel I. Saturday is
      Samedi, perfect lingual after perfect vowel. And finally dimanche
      forsunday (english has SS instead of MM, M is Mind, S is asS)<br>
      l as aleph. interesting. And naturally this order tells that
      monday is the first day, moon is used for counting days. or weeks?<br>
      Monday begins with labial in english, thus it's only natural that
      they consider Sunday the first day, but then that day has to have
      some other name, some name beginning with a vowel. But no such
      words.<br>
      And lets' check english further. If they're other culture why
      would they obey the same order? They're the same lune is moon, and
      others are believed to be synonymic. MTWTFSS SMTWTFS, no, now
      relation. No vowels at all. But labials and linguals are in the
      same rhythm. then a sincope of SS and new weed begins. Indians
      leave vowels separated from the consonants, arabs even believe
      they don't even have vowels (both lie and tortures their tongue,
      it's as if they try to be gross, to fit the looks: movie dubbers
      use for voicing the actors who are of the same type as the
      original ones, so everybody feels better being natural. But would
      some of them CHOOSE to be gross? Satanists exist and who knows
      what perversions people will try to make themselves and others?
      Future is odd indeed. Who knows where it all comes and how fast. I
      know I must do what I can to make the good future come faster than
      the bad one, so we can counterfeit the fate. Let's not misf<font

      Another interpretation can lay between those 3 &amp; 4:<br>
      Sulfur for Fire, Mercury for Water, Salt for the both signs with
      lines in the middle as the salt has.<br>
      Is NaCl EarthAir? Clorine for air because air is gas and chlorine

      Great Lavoisier used 🜔 for 🜁? Wow, I wonder why. wow is wonder
      why? maybe, but more likely that it's just my poetic
      interpretation of a totally glossolalic interjection. междометие.<br>
      <br>
      But either way it seems that only the four elements could be some
      ancient signs, all the other alchemy seems to be relatively modern
      invention. But let's not spill some children with this water. Some
      of these signs can have deep roots. Especially if I accept into
      the consideration the signs for four elements.<br>
      <br>
      For example, this story with the 🜔, Lavoisier could know three
      mothers like 🜂🜔🜄 but then if mercury goes first for a reason,
      🜄🜔🜂. ΔeV &amp; VeΔ? ΛeV &amp; VeΛ?<br>
      Dev &amp; Ved I like much more. because why not to use the exactly
      triangle symbol whence I have one. I would use a letter formed as
      🜄 if I knew one, but V is the closest to it.<br>
      Also that sublime difference between V &amp; 🜂 make them more
      distinct. water is open, fire closes opening. <br>
      <br>
      🜔 instead of 🜁 (somehow going first in that list, who knows why,
      it's in the same order in unicode) may say that he took solids
      more precisely (probably because it's easier to work with a powder
      than with gas. You don't even know if the gas is going to be
      lighter or havier than air. After the first experiment you maybe
      can, or if you read the theoretic grimoirs on alchemy, you
      probably could. I'm only guessing. I conclude it because of 🜔
      being used as 🜁 and not 🜃<br>
      <br>
      It's
🜀🜁🜂🜃🜄🜅🜆🜇🜈🜉🜊🜋🜌🜍🜎🜏🜐🜑🜒🜓🜔🜕🜖🜗🜘🜙🜚🜛🜜🜝🜞🜟🜠🜡🜢🜣🜤🜥🜦🜧🜨🜩🜪🜫🜬🜭🜮🜯🜰🜱🜲🜳🜴<br>
      🜵🜶🜷🜸🜹🜺🜻🜼🜽🜾🜿🝀🝁🝂🝃🝄🝅🝆🝇🝈🝉🝊🝋🝌🝍🝎🝏🝐🝑🝒🝓🝔🝕🝖🝗🝘🝙🝚🝛🝜🝝🝞🝟🝠🝡🝢🝣🝤🝥🝦🝧🝨🝩🝪🝫🝬🝭🝮🝯🝰🝱🝲🝳🝴🝵🝶🝷🝸🝹🝺🝻🝼🝽🝾🝿in

      the unicode and it's 🜁🜃🜂🜄 where I found it first (who knows
      where) so it's double weird. 🜁 is always the first of those four.
      As if it's A, Air, Vowels are Air indeed, as Sefer Yetzirah does
      tell, I dared to argue, insolent kid!<br>
      🜂 for the second is very eastern: ki for fire, k as the first
      consonanant (k &amp; s &amp; ant<font color="#cccccc">er</font>)<br>
      And allow me to guess that the unicode for alchemy was made in the
      east (if it's not, what does it disprove? it just cannot become an
      illustration to what I say. But 🜃 after A doesn't make much
      sense. 🜄 would be perfect second letter, and I looed for
      "🜁🜄🜃🜂" and found some Vesta Simkute, so I registered for a
      consultation with her, I will ask her if she placed those signs
      arbitrary or by some book or other reason. She could place female
      triangles inside the male ones to feel protected, I think it's one
      of her ideas, the protection or the feeling of that. And she just
      answered saying that it just felt right.<br>
      I think it was only natural, that "🜁🜄🜂🜃" had more finds,
      because it's a more consistent zigzag and 🜄🜂 are in the middle
      and it also makes more sense as an alphabetic sequence because of
      that, because of 🜂 is similar to 𐤂 (that's Г, and once again <i>c
        ~ l</i>, ג~λ.<br>
      and 🜃 is similar to Д, especially in some archaic form of it.<br>
      So I will ask that girl, or will I teach her what sequence is
      right, because I think I figured it out, but I have scheduled the
      consulation already, so we'll see what it may bring. what else am
      I to do that evening anyway. 🜃 is terra. Didn't I compare these
      signs to abcd before? I think I did, I will see when I sort these
      notes by topics.<br>
      so is 🜄 this much similar to 🜃, just as b is similar to d,
      epecially in roman cursive.<br>
      is 🜃 a half of 🜄? because ᚦ could be of ᛒ.<br>
      🜁🜄🜂🜃 because c is already lingual, and if Δ is 🜃 then is it a
      form of 🜄? I don't understand. Because I just thought that 🜂 is
      lingual (языки пламени) and 🜃 is some other form of lingual, as
      if that line is the teeth, then V also needs teeth, and are vowels
      labial? because lips seem to distinguish o from a and i, but wait
      a minute, they're different triangles. Is it some code to confuse
      the profans? provence, provincials? Because it's too much to work
      out since it's not V with the dash but the A.<br>
      This 🜁🜄🜂🜃 hypothesis is shaky as a card house they even
      remind. One guess upon another. <br>
      But it's funny, they do remind AVΔe maybe? I recognized 🜔 as e,
      and even though it was 🜁 in Lavoisier's, why not consider 🜃 e
      when it fits, especially because 🜔 seems to be common sum of 🜁
      and 🜃, when I recognized them as Na and Cl. So is 🜃 e or d?
      vowel or lingual? earth is solid, it would be natural Д, even
      natural T, as Terra. but E for Earth also works. and then 🜔 could
      be not ☉ but ⊕. Or is it something inbetween? Okay, I'm thoroughly
      confused, I will return to this some other day.<br>
      No, I'm not. water removes gas? I'm not sure about that, but
      further it comes more consequent.. no, it doesn't. water removes
      fire, not the other way around, and fire eats solids. and solids
      remove air? I don't know by that sequence can go both ways, I
      think here's how it goes:<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Here I found a good diagram: sun, air, ocean, rock. 🜂🜁🜄🜃<br>
      But if I look from here upwards it would be 🜃🜄🜁🜂 EVAΛ va in
      french ехал in russian. z is r in vietnamese, carrot is cà rốt (cà

      Once again, 🜁🜄🜂🜃 is the most alphabetic representation,

      🜁🜄🜂🜃 when it is alphabet is open at least in the first two
      letters: A V and only so. 🜂 can be both Λ(L) 𐤂(c) but also Δ(d)
      but because A &amp; V are open.. can they be followed by the two
      closed? because even though 🜂 can be both Λ, 𐤂 and some c-like <i>L</i><br>
      , how would I open 🜃? It is great as both Д and Ⱚ, both are final
      in their lines. why would e be in the line where A were. abcd. d

      🜂 is both c, l d, t and graphically they are close, but I was
      compaing majuscule forms of theirs (not t, t is just because of d,
      but it resonates l not less than d resonates c, both are the same

      Aurum? is it how the ancient table of substances went? I doubt
      that B was баритъ is barite (baryte) which is BaSO<sub>4</sub><br>
      It is some notation predating mendeleev table, which didn't
      integrate these triangles and circles, Because of C for carbon?
      because I saw that four elements can be drawn by different
      rotation of an angle, ant this is very similar: if ɔ was not
      hydrogen, but oxygen, I would get very exited, but alas Oxygen is
      some — and it is weird and makes me ask: is this table accurate?
      But then my reasoning broke of the reality of me knowing nothing
      about this table, Guessing not making any research is not just
      bold, it's irresponsible.<br>

      this way not only do we rotate it clockwise, we also have it very

      order of imnl mn as claster? iml is the original form of this

        definitions for geosphere. It may be taken as the collective

      Vesta felt it right.<font color="#cccccc"> Also because ABCD is
        how the line goes, not ABDE, but then 🜁🜄🜃🜂 also was

      ABCD instead of ABC or ᛆᛒᚦ closes the question about was it air or

      directly lingual, when C (being also lingual) feels somewhere in
      the throat, which is more H, but then throat is as active as teeth
      (even less) and still tongue does the dance. And anyway горло is
      not far from горы, and that's the reason why velars could stand
      for solids.<br>
