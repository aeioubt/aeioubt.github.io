      Is another case of M before L. So I know only two such cases.<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">(the other one is in "old testament" and if
        you haven't read about it, click that&nbsp; button upstairs and
        look for "only sequence" to find that piece)</font><br>
      <br>
      So called futhark could be another alphabetic arrangement of
      letters:<br>
      ᚠ is F, but ᚨ is A, <font color="#666666"><font color="#000000"><font
            color="#999999">and in "anglo-saxon futhorc"</font></font></font>
      <font color="#666666"><font color="#000000"><font color="#999999">ᚪ
            a, ᚫ æ, ᚩ o</font></font></font><br>
      ᚨ stands in fourth position, where vowel is in bornholm alphabet.
      <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">(ᚩ (o) in anglosaxon futhork stands there)</font><br>
      ᚦ stands in third position, as in bornholm alphabet.<br>
      ᚢ is labial as ᛒ (both are in second position)<br>
      ᚱ is graphically closest to ᛒ and one often look like the other.<br>
      ᚲ stands after that ᛒ as it's supposed to<br>
      ᚷ as it's invariant. or is it staveless ᛡ standing exactly in the
      7th position?<br>
      ᚹᚻᚾ which follow that ᚷ appeal to ionic vocalization of H, because
      ᚹ is labial (a labial half of ᛒ undistinguishable from ᚦ on a
      common staff. Is it Ѳ we cannot figure out whether it's t of f?<br>
      ᛁᛃᛇ claster remind that in IJ or even HIJ, and the ᚻ from a few
      lines above has another form: ᚺ so where does this claster begin
      I'm not sure.<br>
      after this vowel claster comes labial ᛈ <br>
      The same structure, but different transliteration of letters.
      Could they stay vowels, but drift as they did in english, where I
      inscribes no A but pronounces it as AI is I = Z? as it is in some
      ancient scripts, as I is az in old russian, and literally the
      first letter, as I is in roman numerals. Could this order be
      twisted because lines came in different planks? or even in dice,
      where nobody knows which one is the first one. so some dies had
      more zeros than the others.<br>
      ᛉ that follows is either part of the following sequence of
      linguals or an invariant of labial ᛈ as M, shaky table, a bed. zie
      or ma? ma as female denominative (mama, manda, man is "not ma" or
      "belonging to ma"? - жена "принадлежит je" or "isn't je" je is
      male form of this personal pronoun and me is female one? )<br>
      and on it goes as in bornholm alphabet:<br>
      ᛊ=ᛋ, ᛏ <br>
      and after ᛏ, ᛒ follows, as ᚢ does in bornholm alphabet.<br>
      thus ᛒ &amp; ᛏ stand together.<br>
      <br>
      ᛖ is supposed to stand for E, which makes this form be three
      mothers: it is labial M in our script, it is lingual Ϻ in old
      greek, though it's hard for me to buy it, because their M
      sometimes looked just the same. l &amp; I also look the same, but
      wtf! now, with ᛖ this form takes all three forms. and it has pikes
      on its head, just like this tridevi:.. I wanted to bring a picture
      of Hecate, but I found something better: I have no idea how
      correct the info there is, but somebody did a great job collecting
      it there, so you better check it out yourself:
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_deity <br>
      <br>
      and after that vowel ᛖ goes labial ᛗ (and since it's their final
      line, it reminds me of invariants of U V<br>
      and after that ᛗ [M] follows those <span title="runes"
        class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr"></span><span title="runes"
        class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr">ᛚ &amp; </span><span
        title="runes" class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr">ᛜ of L &amp;
        N. N also looks like Ѵ(ѵ) in greek, and ѵ used to be final in
        old russia alphabet - couldn't it be caused by some cultural
        references (as of V reflecting A for example)<br>
        <br>
        and sometimes ᛟᛞ follow, though </span><span title="runes"
        class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr"><span title="runes"
          class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr">ᛞ is believed to be
          double form of </span></span>ᚦ and <span title="runes"
        class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr">ᛟ could be borrowed from Ω<br>
      </span><br>
      <span title="runes" class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr"><span
          title="runes" class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr">But here's
          some other form of futhark:<br>

      <span title="runes" class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr"><span
          title="runes" class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr">As you can
          see, I wasn't wrong about </span></span><span title="runes"

          class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr">ᛡ <br>

          alt="" width="1280" height="256"><br>
      </span><br>
      and look how here it is futhark, but it is the first 7 letters of
      the bornholm alphabet:<br>
      <img src="img/170.png" alt="" width="414" height="945"
        align="left"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ᚠ literally looks like ᚨ<img
        src="continuation_files/Ogham_Con.jpg" alt="" width="196"
        height="491" align="right"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ᚢ looks more like n (ᚿ). <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or like b in ogham.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then ᚦ stands where it had to.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then some vowel, looking like E<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it was supposed to be E<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oficially it's whether a or o<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what follows is supposed to be ᚱ<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and though ᚱ is often written like that<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it looks more like ᚢ<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but in the previous analysis I saw ᛒ <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ᚱ is graphically between ᛒ &amp; ᚢ<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their form correlate with sounds<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vowel ᚢ, labial ᛒ, lingual ᚱ<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another representation of three ladies.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#cccccc"> My name is Deemeetree,
        they say it's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; devoted to Demetra. But it's
        literally 3<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know female deity is triple.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the fourth mother is hidden.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the fourth ball in pyramid of four.</font><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And how are 2nd and 5th letters are different?
      They look exactly the same. No, sometimes second is higher. but
      sometimes it is not. Is it just names of the <br>
      days of the week? as if tuesday and thursday <br>
      were given in the same letter.<br>
      <br>
      Some runologist educate me please, <br>
      I cannot specialize in all of it.<br>
      <br>
      A couple of words of ogham, as soon as it's here:<br>
      It's also named beth luis nun or beth luis noin<br>
      But the third letter is f - was it placed there to reflect t?<br>
      c reflects s in k-symmetry also.<br>
      Sequence M G Ng reminds futharkic one: M L Ng<br>
      G &amp; L are almost invariants, so often they look alike: whether
      as &lt; &amp; ^ <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or as ג &amp; λ
      - in lowercase cursive l is also bigger than c<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; So if we переставим L &amp; G,
      we'll have ogham beginning with BG which follows BC &amp; B is the
      first letter again. The holy book of alphabet had b as the first
      letter. Remeber those runic poems, when each line begins with the
      next level according to alphabetic (or futharkic) sequence. The
      resemblance of alphabetic &amp; futhark structures <font
        color="#999999">(where even direct correlation happens on the
        3rd position and directly repeats at 6th, which alone is well
        out of probability theory. And those correlation keep on coming
        from all the ways, which I think I demonstrated)</font> could be
      caused by some royal poet changing the meaning &amp; sound of
      those lines. That's why such a diverse tradition can be found in
      the kingdom of runic scripts, where one sound goes in different
      visions &amp; same visions go for different sounds, or it could be
      caused by secrecy, which is comical, since many of their
      neighbours had writings, yeah, but then we had some special
      writing system, even if based on the same principles, and maybe
      even on the same magic, but made in our own language &amp; in our
      own manner. Not only musical mode was different, but graphic was
      taken from national signs: tamgas could be the source of
      recognizable graphs, where you know where's eagle, where's snake <font
        color="#cccccc">(3 birds &amp; 3 animals &amp; 3 parts of the
        body &amp; 3 fractions of circle &amp; 3 other things egyptian

        only as ideograms.)</font><br>
      <br>
      Let's collect some more futhark canons allegedly from artifacts
      and ponder on them some more:<br>

        height="464"><br>
      <br>
      Notice, that in both two cases where ᛉ is present it is considered
      to be R/z, not M. <br>
      Could this decipherment or actual case be influenced by hungarian

      Because in alphabetic sequences ᛉ's definitely M. <br>
      <br>
      Let's compare these 3 aetts to Bureus'ы 3 dice:<img
        src="continuation_files/Runrad02.jpg" alt="" width="288"
        height="554" align="right"><br>

      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that division into
      aettir is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; much less important than the
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sequence
      itself, which could be &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unnoticed if we compared them
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without this page from
      Bureus. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though even comparing the other
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two many interesting things
      can be &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; observed, I leave them to you.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See that Bureus recognizes ᛉ as M<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

        height="192"><br>
      <br>
      But we noticed before, that dice are arranged alphabetically, but
      it goes dice by dice in rows:<br>
      <br>
      All ᛁ's are collected in the middle die: ᚴ ᚼ ᚾ ᛁ ᛅ where ᛅ is ᛆ, A
      it's interesting that the following unicode block doesn't include
      this form<font color="#cccccc"> <font color="#999999">(the most
          similar to 1)</font></font> among ᚨᚩᚪᚫᚬᚭᚮᚯᚰ but in ᚽᚾᚿᛀᛁᛂᛃᛄᛅᛆᛇ
      but this second vowel claster predates labial ᛈ and ᛉ as it has ᛁ
      among those vowel, and as I consider ᛈ rare and late, as ᚚ in
      ogham <font color="#999999">(also standing for p, and also
        different from other set. what could it stand for?</font> <font

          color="#999999">pillow?)</font></font> I consider ᛉ the
      original labial, and ᛈ was only introduced to write down "PATER"
      instead of "БАТЯ" or something of that kind. Don't forget,
      russians were under norman command before christians took
      over.&nbsp;

      According to this theory, ᛅ (e) should be in the same band with ᛆ
      (a), but ᛅ is that very (a) and there's no e in that dice set. ᚠ
      should have been in ᛒ's band, but it's in ᚦ's. As there's no e, it
      could be some other alphabetic canon. Or it could be a retarded

        </font>People usually don't publish such raw material, but I
        always wondered why can't I find drafts of people which thought
        I admire, they're extremely hard to find, and they're probably
        very valuable (Leonardo's notebook was bought on some auction
        for 2 billion pounds <font color="#cccccc">(at least I heard it
          on tv, but who can really trust it)</font></font><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Why would I try to find anything based in such late form of
      script? Because something unthinkable to us looked completely
      unchallenged in those times. In what times? It's early 16th
      century. <font color="#cccccc">It's artist's fantasy, what are
        you going to find there? Some secret society emerging at those
        times could inlay their knowledge in that script. So censors
        would look into what the letters speak of, and would never
        challenge the form of the letters. So could this guess lead or
        mislead. We can only see if we follow this guess, at least for
        awhile.</font><br>

              So this resemblance doesn't correlate. Thus I keep on
              believing in aboriginal origin of Canadian aboriginal
              syllabics.<br>
              <br>
              Notice, that canadians don't seem to have syllables with
              -u. They have w, and it's consonant.<br>
              This reflects their geographic proximity to people, living
              on the other side of Pacific ocean, who only have 3
              vowels. Some nations in Americas also have 3 vowels, I
              will research them some other day or night.<br>

              So my memory fed me something else as short hand, but let
              collect some shorthands to see if Evans had any direct
              ancestor of his "invention" (maybe invention for real, but
              I haven't seen it yet, so I'm sceptical, because why would
              you make translation of bible difficult for yourself if
              that didn't make it easier for the aborigines. and because
              christians were caught on faking inventions of writing
              systems (georgian is the brightest example, especially
              since colchide is georgia)<br>

              For three days did Odin hang on that tree. Three aettir

                Bureus'ы occasionally did I wrote. <br>

                it is also red as bi, if you look at it as at latin.<br>
                which could be read as вы [vi] in russian, so rovy would
                be plural for of rah<br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp; Referring to <font color="#cccccc">(I dare
                say)</font> hypothetic letter SAN: Notice how KSI letter
              in Ithaca and Cephallenia is both roman &amp; normanic
              form of M. and SAN reminds MU in both phoenician &amp;
              greek, even though they're different SANs. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; What if that was a tabooed letter too? What
              if it was a trick of a translator when a neighboring
              monarch called your king a мудак, you would like to turn
              it so that they called him судак for example<font

                бы поэтически удобно. политически поэтически, хм. по

                ethnos and ethos could be related here)</font><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N always looks like underwritten M. but
              instead I wonder how MU &amp; SAN could ever coexist. I
              dare to be so silly that I call bs on this issue, even

              Iggor Cavaler sshows why double letters can appear. People
              probably called him egOr as a male form of female word
              igra. or as a possessive - I didn't know here are double
              ss's, but I wrote it correctly for some reason. ss in
              sshows is a typo - casee of plural of the same word. I
              know I don't make it easier for you to read, but take it
              as a training exercise. As I said, it trains them...
              trains. egOr is egor letov he definitely knew (his aunt is
              from omsk) but probably didn't like it (pure metalheads
              don't appreciate punks or they would be not pure but
              dirtier, though I don't know of his case, he probably just
              didn't want them to be confused, name is a logo, a brand)
              <br>
              <br>
              Look how many double letters are in englihs, it wouldn't
              appear there if it wasn't necessary (no triple letters are
              then in deee-lite) <br>
              are then - other than (what I wrote &amp; what I wanted to
              write. This I noticed, but there are probably more like
              that, as if I heard it before I wrote it, but I dodn't
              hera it right (I wanted to write "write")_<br>
              <br>
              I don't correct typos when they'are scyrbos, so whty
              woutld I correct it here, let's look how alive is the
              language. Oh how correctly it wrote, hands got tenser. I
              write with 9 fingers (left thumb just lays, might use a
              mouse btw. wow. And to sell my thumb touchpads (you cannot

              as above so below is the ancient hermetic (Pythaogrean
              term) - I wante d to say e hermetic -= pyhthagorean. Many
              forms of the same word become of typos. Count for typos in
              odl books, old graffitti I dknot know how to write the

              Cat = God<br>
              <br>
              Not only because dog is the opposite (though made of the
              same pieces)<br>
              God = Год = Ход = Хор(ус) = Гор = Тор = Тот? if Год = Гор,
              то Тор = Тот (тот и гермес одно и то же)<br>
              <br>
              I now understand why that hermetic tradition is named this

              выход из ада охраняет пёс, цербер, он решает кого
              выпускать а кого нет (может и диавола самого по легенде
              там держит, тогда этот пёс и есть властелин преисподни) но
              если мир во власти диавола (по христианскому вероучению)
              то земля это и есть ад? на медленном огне, как лягушек

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aubrey said that he has no problem with
              using arguments you don't believe in. Because true
              arguments can be too difficult for audience to understand:
              global warming is a false argument, it's not the issue,
              but true argument is too offensive for the audience: it
              would be rude to call them shit-eathers, for they are
              ready to eat toxic shit with their lungs for a little
              shekel (and most of those who breathes toxic gases because
              some fatgog doesn't care to make money some cleaner way -
              they don't get no money of it, so if you tell they're
              shit-eaters because that fogtag shits in their air
              millions time more than any of them, they may want to kill
              him. Can't say they would be not right either. Do what you
              want, get what you do. Eternity is open, we only have to
              build our shell eternally (externally &amp; internally)<br>
              Follow the logic. Get smart. Hurt only therapeutically.
              Indoors is an option in Spain. Joy is an option
              everywhere. Kill all politicians. Law is low. Mother is
              the first god. <br>

              Gold could be prohibited (as weed) because it has
              something to do with immortality, but today science also
              found immortality, so this law will be abode.<br>
              <br>
              Linguistic is so formal: I also can use the term
              "preterite" but why this snow if most of us know it as
              "past"<br>
              Anyway, what is the term for "future"? a minute ago I
              didn't know the word "preterite" and only heard twice<br>
              <br>
              Or gold could be taken out of population, because they
              murdered the most because of gold. Other than gold most of
              shit isn't worth killing or dying for.<br>

              How hemp is related to immortality? It gives absolute
              health. Imagine living inside of hashish sphere, filled
              with some other useful substance. milk, for example, the
              cannabis milk maybe? Why am I speaking about is this
              collection of valuable information:
              https://mahead.livejournal.com/12991.html and this is to
              be spread by all means necessary, so I even mention it in
              a book on all the other subject. but these topics do
              relate in the field of conspiracies. both forms of science
              (linguistics &amp; pharmacy) are occupied by thieves. Not
              only do they pocket funds they don't deserve, they acquire
              positions they don't deserve. For career you need
              politics, not science. When you do science you have
              neither time nor interest in climing the ladder. only
              people with missions can be the exceptions. But those guys
              on the top they don't challenge the rules, so they don't
              have missions, they have warm seats. Science is introvert,
              politics are extrovert. Which constitutes that science
              should always be private. Even though Musks oust
              Eberhards, it's still not as ugly as they have it in
              academia. But then again beauty is in the eyes of
              beholder, I just express my impression.<br>

              after all. all the linguals of the same line are
              invariants, because there used to be just one lingual per
              vowel. remeber iberian syllabary of 3: b c d<br>
              so literally a b c d<br>
              Spain wins priority from runes &amp; Ireland. Syllabary,
              where could it come from? Linear B. Or there could be
              other writing system I don't know of. Egyptian or one of
              sumerian or Old-persian cuneiform:<br>
              <br>

              Only M &amp; D have whole set of vowels, so I recognize
              them as the mrimal (primal) forms of consonants, all the
              other are forms of these 9.<br>
              Though Da &amp; Aa are again similar, most of the signs
              seem to be connected to their words, though I don't know
              the language to guess those words.<br>

              (but nu, tu, ru are different signs)<br>
              so as there were only two consonants: labial &amp;
              lingual, <br>
              so there were only two vowels: major &amp; minor, Λ &amp;
              V (•ʌ &amp; v) that apple appeared there by accident,
              which resembles bibleic story of \ʌdʌm &amp; eve. we know
              their stories, we don't know ours, thus we're sheeple of
              howse of israel. the same nation, but different class.

              p, f, b, y, x, c, ç, s, ѳ, l, s, z, š, h are probably
              borrowed from neighbouring alphabets. Nobody who used
              alphabets would use syllables, they'd borrow just one and
              used it as they did with all the other letters, thus
              Iberians had syllabic writing system of ABCD, and later
              they disrupted it by borrowing additional sounds from
              their neighbours. If we write english in just those 3
              letters, but in different vowels, we'd have alphabet of
              12, which is little, but known to be sufficient to service
              a human language. Piraha have 11 known letters and one
              "farting" sound they don't usually use when talk to
              europeans (because europeans laugh)<br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though this lack of abecedaries could
              mean that they were a secret teaching and transmitting the

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it's truly ancient, then it's
              fascinating how the second line looks like the third:<br>
              Hey looks like Ayn, and the sixth letter looks like k, and
              the following is l as is seen in runes and rotated half pi
              (quarter of pie) counterclockwise M follows it and N is
              after it, and samex as xi, and a crescent comes next,
              fascincating, it looks like a central letter, and moon is
              a mirror. It is exact central letter, 10 letters at both
              sides of it. 21 letter as that k-symmetry from A to V, but
              the upper syllabary goes further than 10 letters, <font
                color="#cccccc">and the second from the left (or a
                bottom) tells that it could be some runic alphabet.
                relative to hungarian runes? why not rejang?</font> and
              anyway those tens don't make much sense in comparison.
              Could the guy who forged this forgery be hearing something
              real about the alphabet? that it has a "c" in its center.
              I don't even see this as phoenician alphabet. The order is
              all wrong. Or could it be me who's wrong? <br>

              number the quantity of bands it could happen as 100 (even
              though I doubt I have one crush per year, but maybe as a
              teenage I had more. Maybe some other didn't touch me this
              deep because they were not named this magically (or maybe
              magic is rooted into physiology and it excited themselves.
              Magic exists on many levels (from psychologic tricks to
              drugs and poisons I would say before, but now I know it
              could be way deeper. some pre-councious physiology or even

              seriously doubt it magnetic fields can be stable enough.

              and a girl with which I had mutual simpathy. tele and sin

              Another example of telepathy was way more interesting,
              because the recepient was on the other side of the globe,
              and he got the message. But I cannot reveal the details
              before I speak to him to see if it was mutual this time.

              Speaking of chances. Let's calculate how often
              trigrammatons become three mothers: somewhat about
              .(3)*.(3)*.(3) = 1/27 but I allowed X to be labial. And
              though B was not far away in that case, and B is a voiced
              invariant of X [h] in japanese (I don't believe in modern
              family genealogy, japanese has many common features with
              russian (-no is genetive suffix in both, -i is adjective
              suffix in both, some other grammatic forms are similar I

              somebody gave them some english lesson which introduced
              concepts japanese people didn't have before, so they
              borrowed it. Or it could be a weird coincidence too. I'm
              speaking of are, kore, sore being similar to are, here,
              there. But it could be apophenic, could be not, but check

                color="#cccccc">Song under Г was the entry-level for me.
                Song under О is one I should have been turning down, for
                it works as curse, because it said "I'm gonna sit on
                pills you're gonna sit on niddle" and all of this kind
                (so I didn't include it in this book, curses out) but I
                turned it down when "curse-words" were sang, see, curse
                again, so I bought myself some cassssetes of curses. But

              And imagine my shock when I realize I am doing this and
              I'm over 30. So now I see they make us fear them, so we
              can <a href="continuation_files/hmm3.jpg">hate</a> them.
              They make us fear criticizing them so much we'd fear them
              collectively. It looks as they treat us as sheep we seem
              to be. Speaking of magic. Fearsome is black magic. White
              magic is admired. And what is the difference? Black magic
              makes it worse. White magic makes it better. So to
              distinguish between these two one would have to "eat from
              the tree of knowing good and evil" and what god wouldn't
              want us to? One which would want us to be okay with evil
              he did (and oh he did!) so as gnostics said, jewish god is
              satan himself. It's said at least twice in the book of
              revelations: 2:9 &amp; 3:9 (Loci winks the reader, for
              only few to understand)<br>
              Lots of interpretations speak much on this subject, but
              it's all politics. Read for yourself, but don't take that
              <font color="#cccccc">(or this)</font> book too serious,
              they are just what humans said. Whether they <font

              And when I question validity of this coincidence, I notice
              that First letter of АХСИМСЗ is A, last is Z.<br>
              I contacted Alex to ask if he used any alphabetic
              matrices, he said No (whether fates played them to wake me
              up or... fates as AMШ, where second fate was connected to
              Christ earlier. And now I see tridevi relate to trimurti
              of father, son and holy spirit. Was it understanding of
              fatherhood? That birth relates to sex? Could people not
              know that love causes children that you cannot have
              children unless you love or loved? Where all the
              understanding comes from? Some time in the past we
              understood it. Would we consider ourselves human or yet
              beast, it is all arbitrary, we make these definitions to
              understand, but they're only tools to se(ns)e things.<br>
              Son could relate to Sun, which connects these matter to
              fire, and letter San to Shin. <br>
              Then water is Mother for spirit is Love. We don't always
              know who's father, but we know that child relates to
              mother and some Deity (and Love is quite a Deity) played
              its role чтоб появились дети (now this one quite can be a
              coincidence. or could it come from deification of
              children? We nothice that some words are similar or even
              related, imagein how wobvious it were when there were less
              of them. But if it's Mother, than logic tells that son
              should be daughter? Because that's how it is in tridevi
              case. Could daughter be related to day? Dag in dutch it
              is. Could we have an immense language reform when guys
              took over gals? Now this scenario could happen many times,
              when some king took over some queen. Like an ancient
              architypal play. <font color="#cccccc">теперь я ваш мама,

              Inspiration to research human language can be found

              <br>
              and it's vowels are like in sign alphabet of USA:<br>

              And also some consonant signs are related: K became Ka (or
              Ka became K) S became Sa (or Sa became S)<br>
              Ha resembles H, Ra looks like R, but Ma looks like some
              other sign alphabet, the russian one<img

              But could that be that M on that USA table is not shown
              clearly enough, USA uses the same sign alphabets Germany
              does, and many in Americas have similar alphabets:<br>

                  because writing itself could initially be deaf
                  people's way of communicating. <br>
                  <font color="#999999">I figured this out when I
                    thought of A standing for I (both in order it's
                    first and in russian the name of the letter used to
                    be the same as for that first personal pronoun, just
                    as I in english. and V stands for you in
                    netherlands. U today, but historically V &amp; U are
                    the same. And they are showing directions as if V
                    shows to the reader, while A directs to the one who
                    given the letter. So I go hm...<br>

                      but how to transliterate cursive into print
                      correctly? as you can see, it's not always
                      possible, because they're different, sometimes,
                      when too many graphic elements are involved,

                  first language manual I bought in Tbilisi, I even
                  doubt you can get it outside of Georgia. I wanted to
                  contact the authors to know if they placed their
                  letters this way occasionally or because of some
                  ancient tradition, but to no avail. I could only find
                  few mentionings of them. Maybe I should look for them
                  in georgian, though I think I did. <br>

                              tetraktes, we have 33. This number is
                              notable in masonry, and it's the number of
                              years Jesus lived, and it's how many

                              Georgian it is (for russian 33 don't apply

                                научный режим. Т.е. это не совсем наука
                                к которой вы привыкли, но это уже что-то
                                большее чем поэзия, чем первые попытки
                                поэтического исследования языка, и

        color="#cccccc">their understanding of vowels.<br>
        <br>
        Just look at IPA phonetic trapezoid or phonetic trapezium, I
        decided to bring it here even though it's wrong (I'm pretty sure
        there are somewhat wrong information in this book before, so
        stop worrying, at least here we know it's wrong:</font><br>

        height="234"><br>
      <br>
      <p><font color="#cccccc">They teach that what makes vowels
          different is position of the lower jaw (if jaws are close or
          open) and position of the tongue (if it's in the front of the
          mouth, whether it's in the center or back of the mouth) <br>
        </font> </p>
      <font color="#cccccc"> </font>
      <p><font color="#cccccc">Lips are as if they are banned from vowel
          department. Sometimes (as on the image to the left) labialized
          vowels are called rounded, but surch for phonetic trapezium
          and you'll see it's rarely the case.<br>
        </font> </p>
      <font color="#cccccc"> </font>
      <p><font color="#cccccc">My argument is: when you pronounce u,
          your tongue doesn't change sound wherever it is, front or
          back. It only adds some sygyt ubertone when you put its tip in
          the top of your mouth, in the dome of the hard palate. or when
          you press it agains the wall of the mouth it's bringing in
          some consonants, but other than that tongue has no say in the
          nature of the vowel, and I bet even a person without tongue
          can pronounce a decent u. But people without lips cannot
          pronounce u no matter how great their tongue is.<br>
        </font> </p>
      <font color="#cccccc"> </font>
      <p><font color="#cccccc">When you pronounce o, you may pull your
          tounge in the back of the mouth, but when you say "åll", it is
          on the bottom, but in front. I even pronounced it now with my
          tounge's tip in the centre of the mouth, but when I raise him,
          I get something similar to sygyt, but they say european skulls
          are not fit for sygyt.<br>
        </font> </p>
      <font color="#cccccc"> </font>
      <p><font color="#cccccc">Only E &amp; I require tongue at the
          lowest point of hard palate, near alveols, but they don't need
          lips to sound right. and y which is just a fancy i then.<br>
        </font> </p>
      <font color="#cccccc"> </font>
      <p><font color="#cccccc">It's as if vowels also are pure A, two
          labials, two linguals. Ogham combines vowels by exactly this
          order: A, labials, linguals. Exactly the way european
          alphabets combine all the letters (at least 80% of the time: M
          is the only labial among 5 BFMPV that doesn't stand after
          vowel. Also W is special. Could it be that W influenced M
          position or that M caused W? Vowels also stand at some not
          occasional distance. Occasional chaos probably appeared when
          human males usurped power from human females (if you see
          john1:1 as a riddle)<br>

      <font color="#999999">(not only is that trapezium correct, it also

        )</font><br>
      <font color="#cccccc">(I still believe that that trapezium is not
        correct exactly, because lips play much larger role than they
        recognize, but I don't insist on it anymore) this subject
        continues in vol. <a href="9.html"><font color="#cccccc">9</font></a></font><br>

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Language is known even by animals (see <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1kXCh496U0">biolinguistics</a>)
        and I figured out that it could appear exactly between first and
        second signal systems, when someone pronounces something
        involuntarily, and the opponent recognizes it by consciousness
        however primitive it had one. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two of the most involuntarily sounds are Ah!
        of fear &amp; Ha(ha) of laughter, and as you can see, they
        reflect eachother. It's as if Ah was pronounced on the inhale
        and Ha - on the exhale.<br>

                              primal sounds, I am supposed to combine a
                              dictionary from complex words to the basic
                              ones. Only I thought to do it in math
                              terms, where &amp; = +<br>
                              <br>
                              I think I can do it both ways. And if I
                              manage to derive all the language from
                              those two letters of yin &amp; yang of ah
                              &amp; ha. <br>
                              Both primal sounds don't use lips or
                              tongue <br>
                              (any living being can say it (heard inhale
                              (ah!) or heard exhale (ha!)))<br>
                              So lips and tongue can colorize those
                              sounds. Intonations of different vowels
                              could appear before or after tongue &amp;
                              lips acquired semantic features.<br>

                              <br>
                              Though I know which direction I am
                              digging. I have pre-assumption that
                              complex things appeared out of simple
                              ones. Even if after that complex things
                              create simple things (children building
                              sand castles, for example) simplicity
                              still predated the complexity. <br>
                              <br>
                              This pre-assumption is also not arbitrary.
                              So it's not pre-assumption, but conclusion
                              of a previous thought process:<br>
                              Nothing is the only something to which
                              question "where did THIS appear from?" is
                              inapplicable. <br>
                              Which makes it a better candidate to the
                              primordial state. Better than any god or
                              singularity.<br>
                              Only then another question arises: how
                              could anything appear out of nothing? <br>
                              <br>
                              &gt; I can put the ball in your
                              court:&nbsp;&nbsp; What is your view on
                              the Universe, then?<br>
                              &gt; Is it static?<br>
                              It is dynamic. It appeared from vacuum.
                              Vacuum is absolutely empty space. Empty is
                              isotropic. Vacuum was absolute in the
                              absolute past. From absolute past to the
                              present an infinite time passed. We
                              evolved out of nothing because of dx/dt
                              was not absolute zero, but infinitesimal -
                              I like this word, infinitesimal - mal is
                              small in russian, and small is simal, some
                              proto-language of some forgotten
                              civilization sipping to present from the
                              forbidden past.<br>
                              But back on track. Why I think that is the
                              picture of the world:<br>
                              Whatever you put as the beginning (whether
                              it's god, singularity (as big bang names
                              it) or fluctuation (fluctuations can be
                              happening, that's just another wave
                              function common for all the infinite
                              space, but it's too much details, which
                              may distract from the main point, later))
                              - whatever you put as the beginning, it is
                              a subject to a question "Where did THAT
                              come from?" Because THAT is the question
                              Ѳilosoѳy raised. <br>
                              The only subject that question doesn't
                              appear to is nothing. Absolute infinite
                              borderless nothing.<br>
                              Only this subject raises another question
                              "How could anything come from nothing?" By
                              infinite effect of infinite row of
                              exponentiations of infinitesimal
                              accelerations.<br>
                              That is what I found from ѳilosoѳic
                              reasoning, but that guy who wrote the book
                              came to similar conclusions (if spyral
                              movements are what formed this reality,
                              then we are moving toward centers of those
                              spyrals, thus we're shrinking) from
                              ѳysical stance.<br>

                              So I expect language to appear from
                              no_language. But I know animals have some
                              primitive language, but that language can
                              be not primitive enough. I just don't feel
                              like learning apes language, especially
                              since I heard animals have different
                              languages in the same specie.<br>
                              <br>
                              I believe I can find the roots of language
                              just pondering on what I already know.
                              Because this question would still be
                              explicable if no other animals survived at
                              this moment. My ape language is not worse
                              subject for research than theirs. Would
                              anybody really expect that primitive part
                              of language disappear from the modern one?
                              We humans show all sorts of activites.
                              Animals we are.<br>

                              I already speculated that babubi could be
                              a little less than an anecdote. It sounds
                              like something an ape could pronounce. We
                              should look if males in mating season are
                              saying this very word. English baby boo or
                              is it babe, ебу (баб ебу) sounds a little
                              less ape, but ape variants of these
                              sayings can relate to breed and creed.<br>
                              <font color="#cccccc">A funny coincidence
                                or not, but babubi in russian has
                                futurum to it, but it's not future, it's
                                сослагательное наклонение, future in the
                                past. babibu is present? no, it's
                                simple. babubi could be причастием,

      <p>And another thing they don't want you to know:<br>
      </p>
      <p>mole (both mole &amp; моль have different meanings in their
        languages, both of animals: mole is also крот and моль is moth)
        which simply stands for a number 6*<span class="st"><span
            class="st">10<sup>23</sup></span></span> as much as Gogol
        stands for <span class="st"><span class="st">10<sup>100</sup></span></span>.
        Only now they speak about it as much complicated as possible.
        But I just figured out that it's mostly russian perspective,
        because in english wiki it's plain and simple, but watch this
        festival of inextricability:<br>
https://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%9C%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C&amp;oldid=97141466<br>
      </p>
      <p>and now I see it's not unique to russian school, because when I
        rewound wiki backwards, I saw similar level of entangledness:<br>

            is known as <a

            If you are dealing with this many atoms or eggs or artichoke
            hearts, then you have a mole of atoms or eggs or artichoke
            hearts. If you have half this number of such entities, then
            you have half a mole of such entities. </font></p>

      hm... ol = 10 is beautiful, <br>
      m<font color="#cccccc">em</font> is 40 in gematria<br>
      could some other numeral system where m were 23 exist? it only can
      be if some secret society named mol and googol according to it,
      and then this knowledge exists today, and thus these assumptions
      are useles <font color="#cccccc">(useless for this case they
        still astay valuable as examplar, an exhibit)</font><br>
      ain't q00 standing for 100 not beautiful?!<br>

      can we draw a ring and only one through these three dots:<br>

        you can see, these three were like the first three knots
        presented among over eleven dozens.<br>
        so it could be related to this topic.<br>
        <br>
        Language itself speaks of knots in words like notice, note.
        Orthography is pretty arbitrary and serves to void homonyms at
        least in scriptures (for it's harder to ask questions to written
        text)<br>

                  And first in the row is cd, or гд if in russian &amp;
                  greek<br>
                  And g stands for d in russian cursive. (c &amp; g are
                  invarriants, so г is [g] &amp; д is [d])<br>
                  <br>
                  And it correlates to תמא instead of שמא on golem.<br>
                  Though in hebrew direction it's אמת which is truth.<br>

                  Nouns and adjectives are literally names in russian,
                  and naamworden in dutch.<br>
                  And I had a hypothesis, that nouns are names, or names
                  are some basic nouns meaning of most of them are
                  forgotten and their simpler forms reveal something
                  about the official form of the name, and though I
                  forgot the context of that revelation, it revisited me
                  in another twist: имя существительное и имя
                  прилагательное могут соответсвтвовать имени и фамилии
                  (name &amp; surname could be noun &amp; adjective, or
                  visa versa: sergey is also sery which is grey, dim is
                  also an adjective, mary could stand for merry, john
                  for jeune? is it some serious stuff or just my wild
                  imagination?)<br>

                  is to grow into a general science textbook. From abc

      lead me to better understanding of chemistry. And next step to
      understand it was molar volume, which they didn't give us in
      school, and definition of volume is as complicated as possible
      again:

          most of graduates don't)</font> it doesn't tell you much. So
        they taught us molar mass, but without direct understanding of
        what mole is, it doesn't make too much sense for you either,
        enough for those who can follow the patterns without thinking
        too deep into them, but absolutely irrelevant to those who try
        to understand. Molar mass makes way more practical sense though,
        because scales are way more precise than measures. But to
        imagine this nanoworld volumes are important.<br>

                  upd: I decided to put that beasty part into an appen<a

                  <font color="#999999">If solve is free it makes sense,
                    because I just was returned to it by a thought: we
                    don't know if god or sat' are good or bad, becaue
                    though nominally god is good and devil is ed'evil,
                    god of bible does make mean things and Snake or
                    whatever you name his satan (enemy) he seems to have
                    so many, often he is just alright: snake said to
                    humans the truth while god lied to them. It's a
                    tricky book, it's a tricky culture we are finding
                    ourselves in as breadandbutterflies in spidernet. I
                    messee up with the tags, so it lags., c Volume</font>

                  <font color="#cccccc">But let me finish the thought:
                    what we do know is that god is for order and slavery
                    when devil is for chaos and freedom, some will argue
                    though, for people believe in selling one's soul,
                    but having some encounters with that personality, I
                    can tell that he doesn't respect slaves, so those
                    tails of him fooling those entrusting into him are
                    probably true (at least those stories ARE in the
                    culture) but independently from this speculation
                    years ago I realized that there's not a chance for
                    us humans to know who is before us, god or evil, not
                    only because abrahamic god is not exactly good, but
                    because they are smarter than us by default, so or
                    them to fuool us is nothing, so I said in the very
                    beginning of this spiritual journey that I am in
                    neutrality in their quarrel, девочки не ссорьтесь
                    and so on, and it seems I was in the right, fro even
                    d'evil doesn't want me to be some shit without soul,
                    it seems freedom is respected by the chaotic ones,
                    and what concerns the big god or whatever you call
                    him, I keep his tradition alive (if bible relates to
                    him, for in the world being in Satan's hands until
                    the second coming where's the place for god? How do
                    we know that the biggest religions are not "wide is
                    the gate leading to destruction" as if he winks us
                    on our way. So I decided to be neither hot nor cold.
                    We humans try to equalize similar concepts and
                    attempt to pull abstractions onto reality which is
                    also not always accurate. But we'll probably return
                    to this profound question some day, now I should
                    finish the thought for some reason: So free as
                    gases, coagulated as having reacted to something,
                    decomposing, alpha &amp; omewga, gasous &amp;
                    solids, yin &amp; yang or visa versa. Yet I've no
                    idea what I'm talking about, and why. God is
                    associated with immortality &amp; Satan is told to
                    cause the opposite, so who is who and why would
                    anyone be anything, it's just some mind play which
                    went way too far. Why would an atheist like me speak
                    of gods and devils, why do I even need to look at
                    those pictures, I wasn't planning to research these
                    things, but those things were in teh center of the
                    universe of those who invented alphabets, so I feel
                    like I must. So if I equalize death &amp; devil, 13
                    to 15, then the opposite to the third moira is the
                    first one, the one which creates teh thread of life.
                    And what it sat ... what is the second moira I
                    wanter to say, but Composer lags when so many text
                    and tags, and I don't even see what I print, typos
                    all the way, unable to even correct them
                    reflectorily, the second moira seen over abrahamic
                    tradition is the one between god &amp; devil,
                    between angel &amp; demon, and that is us. we are
                    the moira who measures the thread..</font> <br>
