      e m l ŋ<br>
      Is another case of M before L. So I know only two such cases.<br>
      ------<br>
      <br>
      So called futhark could be another alphabetic arrangement of
      letters:<br>
      ᚠ is F, but ᚨ is A, <font color="#666666"><font color="#000000"><font
            color="#999999">and in "anglo-saxon futhorc"</font></font></font>
      <font color="#666666"><font color="#000000"><font color="#999999">ᚪ
            a, ᚫ æ, ᚩ o</font></font></font><br>
      ᚨ stands in fourth position, where vowel is in bornholm alphabet.
      <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">(ᚩ (o) in anglosaxon futhork stands there)</font><br>
      ᚦ stands in third position, as in bornholm alphabet.<br>
      ᚢ is labial as ᛒ (both are in second position)<br>
      ᚱ is graphically closest to ᛒ and one often look like the other.<br>
      ᚲ stands after that ᛒ as it's supposed to<br>
      ᚷ as it's invariant. or is it staveless ᛡ standing exactly in the
      7th position?<br>
      ᚹᚻᚾ which follow that ᚷ appeal to ionic vocalization of H, because
      ᚹ is labial (a labial half of ᛒ undistinguishable from ᚦ on a
      common staff. Is it Ѳ we cannot figure out whether it's t of f?<br>
      ᛁᛃᛇ claster remind that in IJ or even HIJ, and the ᚻ from a few
      lines above has another form: ᚺ so where does this claster begin
      I'm not sure.<br>
      after this vowel claster comes labial ᛈ <br>
      The same structure, but different transliteration of letters.
      Could they stay vowels, but drift as they did in english, where I
      inscribes no A but pronounces it as AI is I = Z? as it is in some
      ancient scripts, as I is az in old russian, and literally the
      first letter, as I is in roman numerals. Could this order be
      twisted because lines came in different planks? or even in dice,
      where nobody knows which one is the first one. so some dies had
      more zeros than the others.<br>
      ᛉ that follows is either part of the following sequence of
      linguals or an invariant of labial ᛈ as M, shaky table, a bed. zie
      or ma? ma as female denominative (mama, manda, man is "not ma" or
      "belonging to ma"? - жена "принадлежит je" or "isn't je" je is
      male form of this personal pronoun and me is female one? )<br>
      and on it goes as in bornholm alphabet:<br>
      ᛊ=ᛋ, ᛏ <br>
      and after ᛏ, ᛒ follows, as ᚢ does in bornholm alphabet.<br>
      thus ᛒ &amp; ᛏ stand together.<br>
      <br>
      ᛖ is supposed to stand for E, which makes this form be three
      mothers: it is labial M in our script, it is lingual Ϻ in old
      greek, though it's hard for me to buy it, because their M looked
      just the same. l &amp; I also look the same, but wtf! now, with ᛖ
      this form takes all three forms. and it has pikes on its head,
      just like this tridevi:.. I wanted to bring a picture of Hecate,
      but I found something better: I have no idea how correct the info
      there is, but somebody did a great job collecting it there, so you
      better check it out yourself:
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_deity <br>
      <br>
      and after that vowel ᛖ goes labial ᛗ (and since it's their final
      line, it reminds me of invariants of U V<br>
      and after that ᛗ [M] follows those <span title="runes"
        class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr"></span><span title="runes"
        class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr">ᛚ &amp; </span><span
        title="runes" class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr">ᛜ of L &amp;
        N. N also looks like Ѵ(ѵ) in greek, and ѵ used to be final in
        old russia alphabet - couldn't it be caused by some cultural
        references (as of V reflecting A for example)<br>
        <br>
        and sometimes ᛟᛞ follow, though </span><span title="runes"
        class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr"><span title="runes"
          class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr">ᛞ is believed to be
          double form of </span></span>ᚦ and <span title="runes"
        class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr">ᛟ could be borrowed from Ω<br>
      </span><br>
      <span title="runes" class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr"><span
          title="runes" class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr">But here's
          some other form of futhark:<br>

            alt="" height="195" width="800"></span></span><br>
      <span title="runes" class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr"><span
          title="runes" class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr">As you can
          see, I wasn't wrong about </span></span><span title="runes"
        class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr"><span title="runes"
          class="script-runic" lang="gem-Runr">ᛡ <br>
          <br>
          and another one: <br>

          alt="" height="256" width="1280"><br>
      </span><br>
      and look how here it is futhark, but it is the first 7 letters of
      the bornholm alphabet:<br>
      <img src="img/170.png" alt="" height="945" align="left"
        width="414"><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ᚠ literally looks like ᚨ<img
        src="continuation_files/Ogham_Con.jpg" alt="" height="491"
        align="right" width="196"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ᚢ looks more like n (ᚿ). <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or like b in ogham.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then ᚦ stands where it had to.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then some vowel, looking like E<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it was supposed to be E<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oficially it's whether a or o<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what follows is supposed to be ᚱ<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and though ᚱ is often written like that<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it looks more like ᚢ<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but in the previous analysis I saw ᛒ <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ᚱ is graphically between ᛒ &amp; ᚢ<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their form correlate with sounds<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vowel ᚢ, labial ᛒ, lingual ᚱ<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another representation of three ladies.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#cccccc"> My name is Deemeetree,
        they say it's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; devoted to Demetra. But it's
        literally 3<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dame3. tra as female form of tri.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know female deity is triple.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the fourth mother is hidden.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the fourth ball in pyramid of four.</font><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And how are 2nd and 5th letters are different?
      They look exactly the same. No, sometimes second is higher. but
      sometimes it is not. Is it just names of the <br>
      days of the week? as if tuesday and thursday <br>
      were given in the same letter.<br>
      <br>
      Some runologist educate me please, <br>
      I cannot specialize in all of it.<br>
      <br>
      A couple of words of ogham, as soon as it's here:<br>
      It's also named beth luis nun or beth luis noin<br>
      But the third letter is f - was it placed there to reflect t?<br>
      c reflects s in k-symmetry also.<br>
      Sequence M G Ng reminds futharkic one: M L Ng<br>
      G &amp; L are almost invariants, so often they look alike: whether
      as &lt; &amp; ^ <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or as ג &amp; λ
      - in lowercase cursive l is also bigger than c<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; So if we переставим L &amp; G,
      we'll have ogham beginning with BG which follows BC &amp; B is the
      first letter again. The holy book of alphabet had b as the first
      letter. Remeber those runic poems, when each line begins with the
      next level according to alphabetic (or futharkic) sequence. The
      resemblance of alphabetic &amp; futhark structures <font
        color="#999999">(where even direct correlation happens on the
        3rd position and directly repeats at 6th, which alone is well
        out of probability theory. And those correlation keep on coming
        from all the ways, which I think I demonstrated)</font> could be
      caused by some royal poet changing the meaning &amp; sound of
      those lines. That's why such a diverse tradition can be found in
      the kingdom of runic scripts, where one sound goes in different
      visions &amp; same visions go for different sounds, or it could be
      caused by secrecy, which is comical, since many of their
      neighbours had writings, yeah, but then we had some special
      writing system, even if based on the same principles, and maybe
      even on the same magic, but made in our own language &amp; in our
      own manner. Not only musical mode was different, but graphic was
      taken from national signs: tamgas could be the source of
      recognizable graphs, where you know where's eagle, where's snake <font
        color="#cccccc">(3 birds &amp; 3 animals &amp; 3 parts of the
        body &amp; 3 fractions of circle &amp; 3 other things egyptian
        alphabet is having. their writing system have more beasts, but
        only as ideograms.)</font><br>
      <br>
      Let's collect some more futhark canons allegedly from artifacts
      and ponder on them some more:<br>

        width="756"><br>
      <br>
      Notice, that in both two cases where ᛉ is present it is considered
      to be R/z, not M. <br>
      Could this decipherment or actual case be influenced by hungarian

      Because in alphabetic sequences ᛉ's definitely M. <br>
      <br>
      Let's compare these 3 aetts to Bureus'ы 3 dice:<img
        src="continuation_files/Runrad02.jpg" alt="" height="554"

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that division into
      aettir is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; much less important than the
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sequence
      itself, which could be &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unnoticed if we compared them
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without this page from
      Bureus. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though even comparing the other
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two many interesting things
      can be &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; observed, I leave them to you.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See that Bureus recognizes ᛉ as M<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <img src="continuation_files/Elder-Futhark.jpg" alt=""
        height="192" width="364"><br>
      <br>
      But we noticed before, that dice are arranged alphabetically, but
      it goes dice by dice in rows:<br>
      <br>
      All ᛁ's are collected in the middle die: ᚴ ᚼ ᚾ ᛁ ᛅ where ᛅ is ᛆ, A
      it's interesting that the following unicode block doesn't include
      this form<font color="#cccccc"> <font color="#999999">(the most
          similar to 1)</font></font> among ᚨᚩᚪᚫᚬᚭᚮᚯᚰ but in ᚽᚾᚿᛀᛁᛂᛃᛄᛅᛆᛇ
      but this second vowel claster predates labial ᛈ and ᛉ as it has ᛁ
      among those vowel, and as I consider ᛈ rare and late, as ᚚ in
      ogham <font color="#999999">(also standing for p, and also
        different from other set. what could it stand for?</font> <font
        color="#cccccc">(podushka?)</font> <font color="#666666"><font
          color="#999999">pillow?)</font></font> I consider ᛉ the
      original labial, and ᛈ was only introduced to write down "PATER"
      instead of "БАТЯ" or something of that kind. Don't forget,
      russians were under norman command before christians took
      over.&nbsp;

      ᛒ stands in Bureus's table in the third die (which is actully the

      ᛚ&nbsp; ᛋ ᛐ) 2 is female sign, just as ᛉ &amp; ᛋ, did they bring
      their partners? because ᛒ is female, but single. was that sixth

      Everybody should be tripping,. alcohol they give ya is all no

      According to this theory, ᛅ (e) should be in the same band with ᛆ
      (a), but ᛅ is that very (a) and there's no e in that dice set. ᚠ
      should have been in ᛒ's band, but it's in ᚦ's. As there's no e, it
      could be some other alphabetic canon. Or it could be a retarded

        </font>People usually don't publish such raw material, but I
        always wondered why can't I find drafts of people which thought
        I admire, they're extremely hard to find, and they're probably
        very valuable (Leonardo's notebook was bought on some auction
        for 2 billion pounds <font color="#cccccc">(at least I heard it
          on tv, but who can really trust it)</font></font><br>

      Why would I try to find anything based in such late form of
      script? Because something unthinkable to us looked completely
      unchallenged in those times. In what times? It's early 16th
      century. <font color="#cccccc">It's artist's fantasy, what are
        you going to find there? Some secret society emerging at those
        times could inlay their knowledge in that script. So censors
        would look into what the letters speak of, and would never
        challenge the form of the letters. So could this guess lead or
        mislead. We can only see if we follow this guess, at least for
        awhile.</font><br>

              So this resemblance doesn't correlate. Thus I keep on
              believing in aboriginal origin of Canadian aboriginal
              syllabics.<br>
              <br>
              Notice, that canadians don't seem to have syllables with
              -u. They have w, and it's consonant.<br>
              This reflects their geographic proximity to people, living
              on the other side of Pacific ocean, who only have 3
              vowels. Some nations in Americas also have 3 vowels, I
              will research them some other day or night.<br>

              So my memory fed me something else as short hand, but let
              collect some shorthands to see if Evans had any direct
              ancestor of his "invention" (maybe invention for real, but
              I haven't seen it yet, so I'm sceptical, because why would
              you make translation of bible difficult for yourself if
              that didn't make it easier for the aborigines. and because
              christians were caught on faking inventions of writing
              systems (georgian is the brightest example, especially

              form of M. and SAN reminds MU in both phoenician &amp;
              greek, even though they're different SANs. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; What if that was a tabooed letter too? What
              if it was a trick of a translator when a neighboring
              monarch called your king a мудак, you would like to turn
              it so that they called him судак for example<font

              Iggor Cavaler sshows why double letters can appear. People
              probably called him egOr as a male form of female word
              igra. or as a possessive - I didn't know here are double
              ss's, but I wrote it correctly for some reason. ss in
              sshows is a typo - casee of plural of the same word. I
              know I don't make it easier for you to read, but take it
              as a training exercise. As I said, it trains them...
              trains. egOr is egor letov he definitely knew (his aunt is
              from omsk) but probably didn't like it (pure metalheads
              don't appreciate punks or they would be not pure but
              dirtier, though I don't know of his case, he probably just
              didn't want them to be confused, name is a logo, a brand)
              <br>
              <br>
              Look how many double letters are in englihs, it wouldn't
              appear there if it wasn't necessary (no triple letters are
              then in deee-lite) <br>
              are then - other than (what I wrote &amp; what I wanted to
              write. This I noticed, but there are probably more like
              that, as if I heard it before I wrote it, but I dodn't
              hera it right (I wanted to write "write")_<br>
              <br>
              I don't correct typos when they'are scyrbos, so whty
              woutld I correct it here, let's look how alive is the
              language. Oh how correctly it wrote, hands got tenser. I
              write with 9 fingers (left thumb just lays, might use a
              mouse btw. wow. And to sell my thumb touchpads (you cannot
              patent them, because it's easily proved that this
              information appeared in public domain before you) I have

              as above so below is the ancient hermetic (Pythaogrean
              term) - I wante d to say e hermetic -= pyhthagorean. Many
              forms of the same word become of typos. Count for typos in
              odl books, old graffitti I dknot know how to write the

              Cat = God<br>
              <br>
              Not only because dog is the opposite (though made of the
              same pieces)<br>
              God = Год = Ход = Хор(ус) = Гор = Тор = Тот? if Год = Гор,
              то Тор = Тот (тот и гермес одно и то же)<br>
              <br>
              I now understand why that hermetic tradition is named this

              выход из ада охраняет пёс, цербер, он решает кого

              если мир во власти диавола (по христианскому вероучению)

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aubrey said that he has no problem with
              using arguments you don't believe in. Because true
              arguments can be too difficult for audience to understand:
              global warming is a false argument, it's not the issue,
              but true argument is too offensive for the audience: it
              would be rude to call them shit-eathers, for they are
              ready to eat toxic shit with their lungs for a little
              shekel (and most of those who breathes toxic gases because
              some fatgog doesn't care to make money some cleaner way -
              they don't get no money of it, so if you tell they're
              shit-eaters because that fogtag shits in their air
              millions time more than any of them, they may want to kill
              him. Can't say they would be not right either. Do what you
              want, get what you do. Eternity is open, we only have to
              build our shell eternally (externally &amp; internally)<br>
              Follow the logic. Get smart. Hurt only therapeutically.
              Indoors is an option in Spain. Joy is an option
              everywhere. Kill all politicians. Law is low. Mother is
              the first god. <br>

              Gold could be prohibited (as weed) because it has
              something to do with immortality, but today science also
              found immortality, so this law will be abode.<br>
              <br>
              Linguistic is so formal: I also can use the term
              "preterite" but why this snow if most of us know it as
              "past"<br>
              Anyway, what is the term for "future"? a minute ago I
              didn't know the word "preterite" and only heard twice<br>
              <br>
              Or gold could be taken out of population, because they
              murdered the most because of gold. Other than gold most of
              shit isn't worth killing or dying for.<br>

              How hemp is related to immortality? It gives absolute
              health. Imagine living inside of hashish sphere, filled
              with some other useful substance. milk, for example, the
              cannabis milk maybe? Why am I speaking about is this
              collection of valuable information:
              https://mahead.livejournal.com/12991.html and this is to
              be spread by all means necessary, so I even mention it in
              a book on all the other subject. but these topics do
              relate in the field of conspiracies. both forms of science
              (linguistics &amp; pharmacy) are occupied by thieves. Not
              only do they pocket funds they don't deserve, they acquire
              positions they don't deserve. For career you need
              politics, not science. When you do science you have
              neither time nor interest in climing the ladder. only
              people with missions can be the exceptions. But those guys
              on the top they don't challenge the rules, so they don't
              have missions, they have warm seats. Science is introvert,
              politics are extrovert. Which constitutes that science
              should always be private. Even though Musks oust
              Eberhards, it's still not as ugly as they have it in
              academia. But then again beauty is in the eyes of

              выплес(нуть, кивать, нул, ни, ну, киваю, кивал, кивали,
              кивают, кивай)<br>
              "выплес" приставлен к "кивать" экспрескивать,
              экспреснуть&nbsp; или "нуть" так словно это одно и то же.<br>
              нуть кивать гнуть? ниц (поклон) пригнуть, приопустить, низ

              after all. all the linguals of the same line are
              invariants, because there used to be just one lingual per
              vowel. remeber iberian syllabary of 3: b c d<br>
              so literally a b c d<br>
              Spain wins priority from runes &amp; Ireland. Syllabary,
              where could it come from? Linear B. Or there could be
              other writing system I don't know of. Egyptian or one of
              sumerian or Old-persian cuneiform:<br>
              <br>

              Only M &amp; D have whole set of vowels, so I recognize
              them as the mrimal (primal) forms of consonants, all the
              other are forms of these 9.<br>
              Though Da &amp; Aa are again similar, most of the signs
              seem to be connected to their words, though I don't know
              the language to guess those words.<br>

              so as there were only two consonants: labial &amp;
              lingual, <br>

              V (•ʌ &amp; v) that apple appeared there by accident,
              which resembles bibleic story of \ʌdʌm &amp; eve. we know
              their stories, we don't know ours, thus we're sheeple of

              p, f, b, y, x, c, ç, s, ѳ, l, s, z, š, h are probably
              borrowed from neighbouring alphabets. Nobody who used
              alphabets would use syllables, they'd borrow just one and
              used it as they did with all the other letters, thus
              Iberians had syllabic writing system of ABCD, and later
              they disrupted it by borrowing additional sounds from
              their neighbours. If we write english in just those 3
              letters, but in different vowels, we'd have alphabet of
              12, which is little, but known to be sufficient to service
              a human language. Piraha have 11 known letters and one
              "farting" sound they don't usually use when talk to
              europeans (because europeans laugh)<br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though phoenician alphabet is

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to make this things worse, here's
              another alleged artefact syllabary from the same LIBAN:<br>
              <img src="continuation_files/DxqStBz9VfY.jpg" alt=""
                height="420" align="left" width="714"><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I thought "why would anybody want
              to put the alphabet on his tombstone if he had nothing to
              do with invention of it, but reality is funnier than any
              fiction:<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's Achiram sarcophagus, and though
              there is a writing upon its lead, that writing is
              something else. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though this lack of abecedaries could
              mean that they were a secret teaching and transmitting the
              know-how of speaking letters could be a capital offense.
              or it can have some other explanation.<br>

              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But here's something claimed to be
              phoenician abecedary, even two <font color="#cccccc">(дайте

              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it's truly ancient, then it's
              fascinating how the second line looks like the third:<br>
              Hey looks like Ayn, and the sixth letter looks like k, and
              the following is l as is seen in runes and rotated half pi
              (quarter of pie) counterclockwise M follows it and N is
              after it, and samex as xi, and a crescent comes next,
              fascincating, it looks like a central letter, and moon is
              a mirror. It is exact central letter, 10 letters at both
              sides of it. 21 letter as that k-symmetry from A to V, but
              the upper syllabary goes further than 10 letters, <font
                color="#cccccc">and the second from the left (or a
                bottom) tells that it could be some runic alphabet.
                relative to hungarian runes? why not rejang?</font> and
              anyway those tens don't make much sense in comparison.
              Could the guy who forged this forgery be hearing something
              real about the alphabet? that it has a "c" in its center.
              I don't even see this as phoenician alphabet. The order is
              all wrong. Or could it be me who's wrong? <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But here I found something that could
              be the original form of that souvenir artefact: <br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks like an abecedary stamp, an
              ancient print. Was it stamped on leather of pergament with
              golden script?<br>

              &nbsp; Let's return to AXC for a while, let's calculate
              the probability of that chance. I was excited about them
              before I knew this relation to my favourite theme. Let's
              number the quantity of bands it could happen as 100 (even
              though I doubt I have one crush per year, but maybe as a
              teenage I had more. Maybe some other didn't touch me this
              deep because they were not named this magically. Magic
              exists on many levels (from psychologic tricks to drugs
              and poisons I would say before, but now I know it could be
              way deeper. some pre-councious physiology or even physical
              ways of resonance (chaos doesn't accept laws, it has its
              ways though) or who knows, maybe even transcendous ways of
              conscious ghosts, who knows what sort of beings magnetic
              fields can build. Though I seriously doubt it magnetic
              fields can be stable enough. But do I believe in clouds of
              bacteria behaving as ghosts? Can colonies of procariots
              have consciousness?<br>
              <br>
              This topic is still so much new to me, though I observed
              bright examples of telepathy, and if one could be
              explained by common objective images and topics when me
              and a girl with which I had mutual simpathy. tele and sin
              but pathy could stand for a "path" a "connection". <br>
              Another example of telepathy was way more interesting,
              because the recepient was on the other side of the globe,
              and he got the message. But I cannot reveal the details
              before I speak to him to see if it was mutual this time.
              For it could be an oddest coincidence.<br>
              <br>
              Speaking of chances. Let's calculate how often
              trigrammatons become three mothers: somewhat about
              .*3)*.(3)*.(3) = 1/27 but I allowed X to be labial. And
              though B was not far away in that case, and B is a voiced
              invariant of X [h] in japanese (I don't believe in modern
              family genealogy, japanese has many common features with
              russian (-no is genetive suffix in both, -i is adjective
              suffix in both, some other grammatic forms are similar I
              cannot name right know, but hoshi (wanna) is hochu in
              russian) and some weirdest concepts from english (as
              somebody gave them some english lesson which introduced
              concepts japanese people didn't have before, so they
              borrowed it. Or it could be a weird coincidence too. I'm
              speaking of are, kore, sore being similar to are, here,
              there. But it could be apophenic, could be not, but check
              out this mnemonic table of kana, for it can help you to
              remember some of them.<br>

              I don't remember any other triliteral band among what I've

              You should understand how their songs liberated my spirit.
              I was such a coward I didn't admit it.,And when I turned
              my stereo down not to let somebody hear <a

              or <a

              I only did so to ГрОб not to let my parents hear the
              explicit lyrics. And imagine my shock when I realize I am
              doing this and I'm over 30. So now I see they make us fear
              them, so we can <a href="continuation_files/hmm3.jpg">hate</a>
              them. They make us fear criticizing them so much we'd fear
              them collectively. It looks as they treat us as sheep we
              seem to be. Speaking of magic. Fearsome is black magic.
              White magic is admired. And what is the difference? Black
              magic makes it worse. White magic makes it better. So to
              distinguish between these two one would have to "eat from
              the tree of knowing good and evil" and what god wouldn't
              want us to? One which would want us to be okay with evil
              he did (and oh he did!) so as gnostics said, jewish god is
              satan himself. It's said at least twice in the book of
              revelations: 2:9 &amp; 3:9<br>
              Lots of interpretations speak much on this subject, but
              it's all politics. Read for yourself, but don't take that
              <font color="#cccccc">(or this)</font> book too serious,
              they are just what humans said. Whether they <font

              Inspiration to research human language can be found
              anywhere. For example, look at the pletora of sign

              <br>
              and it's vowels are like in sign alphabet of USA:<br>

                height="1024" width="599"><br>
              And also some consonant signs are related: K became Ka (or
              Ka became K) S became Sa (or Sa became S)<br>
              Ha resembles H, Ra looks like R, but Ma looks like some
              other sign alphabet, the russian one<img

              <br>
              <br>
              But could that be that M on that USA table is not shown
              clearly enough, USA uses the same sign alphabets Germany
              does, and many in Americas have similar alphabets:<br>

                valuable source of alphabetic research I will probably
                dive into, or you may go there yourself, looking for
                previous forms of alphabet by comparing signs existing
                in different alphabetic structures. but seriously
                speaking, is it the field of research we need to go
                right now? Why I'm asking is we're going to acquire
                computational powers of extra ultraneocortex by merging
                with computers and AI, so why now? just to show that
