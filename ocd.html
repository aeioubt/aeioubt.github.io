          (I had some other ocd's like I didn't step on cracks (probably
          because somebody fucked me up with that as a kid, but I cured
          that by playing some other game, where I stepped on as many
          cracks as possible, and then it made me not to give a fuck
          about cracks, so it already has some cure. good luck)</font><br>
      </font>Okay, here I dare to show you what I asked myself not to
      spread: an implimentation of crowlean spells-making (when you
      cross out doubles from the wish to make une "abracadabric"
      collection of sounds, I went further than that (only that I didn't
      cross out all the multiples, as I read (probably in a false
      source, or is it the rule I mistook or is there different
      traditions? crossing out all the multiples could be an incentive
      to speak short. But the tradition I used, when I crossed out only
      even multiples, and left odd ones to be, allowed me to go on with
      unlimited ammount of text, which was my ocd: I kept on calculating
      the odd coagula of texts around me, and here some tricks I use to
      go further than taught:<br>
      ч(ch) was broken into k &amp; h (because that's how in english)<br>
      ш(sh) was broken into s &amp; h<br>
      i's and u's were crossed out, because they could be spelled as ee
      &amp; oo<br>
      (and it made me think: are e &amp; o the original lingualized
      &amp; labialized vowels? It's supported by I &amp; U being the
      most mut(il)ated lines (e-line is alright im those not following
      the greek pattern. thus o-line is even more stable than e-line,
      but o can be represented as au, e can be a, just as russians
      wouldn't distinguish between pen and pan in some dialects of
      english.<br>
      There were questions about how ш is transliterated in french and
      german: sch and ch<br>
      but I decided to focus on english spelling, otherwise rules could
      be contradictory, or I could've drop it all in to see what residue
      it leaves then. <br>
      e was broken into a and i (because it was ratianalized as йэ, and
      й/и ~ a/э<br>
      o was equal to a, because ё/е ~ йо/йэ and that / stood for
      seminotes, thus йо ~ йа, thus o ~ a, where ~ stands pretty much
      for =<br>
      and now its funny that au = o = a, also because u can be nullified
      as oo, so this addition of french spelling rule didn't bring any
      contradiction, but maybe because it's used in english too.<br>
      but if we equalize ch &amp; sh, we'll get rid of even more
      letters, because now k ~ s, thus x goes, which it never did when I
      was obsessed with this ocd, so can I combine all the spelling
      rules of europe to find the most basic groups of letters? <br>
      I think it's time for me to wipe dust of this weird habit of mine
      to play this game once again in the name of science.<br>
      sch ~ sh tells that c doesn't matter, so it can be thrown away
      together with o, i, x, but then ch ~ sh tells that s doesn't
      matter too. <br>
      so all ш's are just h, just as I explained its position in latin
      lineal system in the very beginning, but I'm still not convinced
      it's not a coincidence.<br>
      and in my ocd sh ~ t, because th ~ s <br>
      I think I would put it as th/s, but I do remember ш was equal to
      т, thus s stands between them.<br>
      But it's still a question if th ~ s or th/s (now when I add all
      the other spellings, I will work on this, but I still wonder why
      do I decide to jump into these waves of utter madness, even if it
      bring some result, what scientific value will it has, won't it
      fuck up with my ability to notice the actual linguistic facts?<br>
      <br>
      if sh ~ t, then t ~ h, then the is e, which repeats after hebrew ה<br>
      (still a coincidence, but I will thread this thread, just in case
      it isn't)<br>
      <br>
      th ~ s, because the ~ cей<br>
      й was seen some dies/bemol of и, and и was decomposed as йы, which
      made ы that universal semitone sine (sign) just as ч was (c/h) but
      now it's just h, which whether makes h that semitone too, just as
      it stands between s &amp; sh, t &amp; th, as any madness, it's
      complicated, I will uncomple it, if I dare.<br>
      Or should I just throw this piece away at once?<br>
      <br>
      ei is ай in german, thus it's aii, thus й is nothing, just as i,
      thus what is ы? not even a letter in most languages, or a form of
      i, like y, which also decomposes as ij in dutch, and just as j is
      an invariant of i, it goes away just as i did. And it's funny,
      because it also went away as ʤ with d and ʒ crossing each other
      out the same was t and ʃ did. voiced was the only thing I couldn't
      substitute with something else, and as a result sometimes I had
      spells with silent n or other not existing phonemes (as dente
      would be compressed, you see, I didn't work with wishes (all my
      wiishes are granted anyway) I just played with random texts)<br>
      <br>
      so if ч is not ch, but tʃ shouldn't it also go away completely?
      and thus h goes away too, together with it's invariant x.<br>
      <br>
      does t persist? if ш went completely, so should t, so it isn't a
      letter? in this delirium it isn't. it used to be, but I went
      further, and I got my system less incomplete, but more
      contradictory. But I still don't understand Gödel's theorem, so I
      don't refer to it. As I was taught by my father not to accept on
      faith what I don't understand.<br>
      <br>
      As you can see, I don't give you exactly the system I used in my
      ocd, but I feel free to reform it as I speak<br>
      And now I see that the only reason e wasn't equal to a is that i
      wasn't dissolved as ee, and neither u was oo, or that was how I
      freed myself from that ocd, by overcomplicating it with the rules
      and turning it into some contradiction, which made this system
      less sacred. And I also commanded myself to channel these eternal
      forces into more scientific route. But this madness is how I
      focused on an alphabet in some registry bureau when I found the
      lineal structure (but I was long freed from this ocd when I found
      the axial one)<br>
      <br>
      If we add dannish aa ~ o, then o is dissolved, and then a is
      dissolved to, because in previous (shorter) rules a ~ o<br>
      and глсн лшн once aain.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I don't feel like editing that text above, you;re not even
      supposed to read it all, so now I'll produce some spells in my
      ancient school, the way I made it when I was let's say twenty:<br>
      <br>
      Я вечно молодой бессмертный<br>
      Я вемо молодой бемертни<br>
      я ве лодой бмртни (here I would сбился бы)<br>
      вы лдй бмртни<br>
      ви лт пмртни<br>
      вилт ри<br>
      влтр<br>
      выт<br>
      <br>
      but vltr sounds batter<br>
      <br>
      I don't know why this комканье желаний позитивно, а не
      деструктивно, но у меня все мечты сбываются, хотя чаще всего я
      собирал в такие комочки совершенно рандомнейшие вещи<br>
      Или тем я ублажал духов тех мест, и некоторые из них подогревали
      меня недостающим мне? <br>
      мистика, я погряз в магическом мышлении дрвених людей, создателей
      чёртова алвавита.<br>
      <br>
      I am eternally young immortal<br>
      аем итёрналли янг иммортал<br>
      им итёрнаи янг иортал<br>
      митёрна янг иртл<br>
      I would make it in my mind in some other way (probably shortening
      the beginning first and then going down, but let's do it both way:<br>
      миторг иртл<br>
      могл<br>
      глом<br>
      <br>
      now I do my best to make it in my mind as I usally did it, trying
      not to type before I know what to type:<br>
      им..<br>
      мтёма..<br>
      тёа..<br>
      тонг (here I realize I probably lost the suffix -ly)<br>
      им<br>
      мтёмали<br>
      тёали<br>
      таёли<br>
      толинг (yep, I did lose that -ly)<br>
      толнг<br>
      толнготэ<br>
      лнгэ<br>
      лэнг<br>
      (which can be easily transformed into глом (because o &amp; э were
      <font color="#cccccc">(in my ocd)</font> considered half-tone,
      which was transfered to half-tone between н &amp; м)<br>
      and also ранг is a good comprehensible word to short it into, yet
      even though most of the time it went that well, it could turn into
      something weird like whispering n or even whispering n and voiced
      o.<br>
      I wonder if it was my subconsciousness who gave me no, does it
      mean such results would be noes..<br>
