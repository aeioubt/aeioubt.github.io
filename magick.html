      This morning I woke up thinking that Devil and Satan could be the
      same word: <br>
      -il and -an are obvious suffices<br>
      Devil is Teufel in German. T is way closer to S, because ת can be
      read both ways. and also because the truer form of אמש is אמת <font
        color="#cccccc">(read about it somewhere in the main part)</font><br>
      f &amp; t could be the same letter not only because they're
      similar in ogham, the same way t reminds f, but both readings also
      meet in θѳ but then this is th. Which makes this common steam
      nothing else than Death.<br>
      And it is told, that Devil eats your soul away. But then who is
      the person who tells "So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor
      cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth."?<br>
      Amen could be another form of אמת for they say that amen meant
      truth, so these words are at least related.<br>
      <br>
      So back to Bathomet, and his wickedness:<br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/aba/chap12.htm"><img
          src="continuation_files/crowley.png" alt="" border="0"
          width="700" height="475"></a><br>
      <br>
      That image leads to where he spoke the first part, and I'm yet to
      find where he recommends killing aryans. but his hat tells both
      who are his demons and why AC is much more prominent than AB.<br>
      True witches are females. Male witches are degenerates.<br>
      And I never said those female witches are not wicked. But people
      kill for all known reasons, these criminals don't deserve any
      special treatments, especially not because of their
      dnst-3-induced-folie-a-deux. After all, other criminals are also
      wicked, weakened, weak.<br>
      But there's a difference in those crimes, which could be the
      reason for magical crimes to be punished more severely: ritual
      murder is performed with the suffering of the victim. But this I
      don't necessarily know, that is what tells pizzagate conspiracy
      theory, that adrenochrome is in larger ammount when the victim
      suffers. Today, when adrenochrome can be synthesized, these
      horrible murders should be more rare (but unfortunately can only
      refer to adrenochrome addicts, ritual murders made for
      psychological change in the magician (as a materialist, I can only
      believe that psychological state of a murderer is the result of
      the ritual, such breaking of the taboo can make the degenerate
      feel special, and when one believes something, one can express it
      into the world (it is some bold claim, I must deliver some
      scientific or any source about it)<br>
      <br>
      I am not competent to write on this subject. I read neither AB nor
      AC, I always considered mystics mistaken or charlatan, and now I
      only see hey also bear some knowledge <font color="#cccccc">(bear
        and tear could be the opposite forms, just as бур и тур but
        these two are in different meaning if in stock-market, not sure
        they're in older meanings: медведь может что-нибудь утащить, бык
        может разрыть? рогами, копытами, плугом. не знаю это такое сырое
        и непонятное. серый шрифт) </font><br>
      but not every knowledge is healthy, or is it all healthy until you
      start implementing what it tells you? nah, even evil information
      can traumatize. It's another complex question I don't feel
      competent about.<br>
