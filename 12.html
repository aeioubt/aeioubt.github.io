      word is во рту<br>
      rot is red (rot is mouth in russian, and probably because it is
      red)<br>
      rot in english is red because of inflammation.<br>
      is it? How dare I mix this all up before the results from the
      program comparing words from the monoliteral up are ready? <br>

      Here something relating to the rotations I discuss since vol. 1<br>
      <br>
      <img src="12_files/child_Roland.jpg" alt="" width="1785"
        height="1056"><br>
      <font size="+1">"Fair Burd Helen," said the Magician, "must have
        been carried off with her shadow by the fairies when she was
        running round the church widershins; for fairies have power when
        folk go against the light. She will now be in the Dark Tower of
        the King of Elfland, and none but the boldest knight in
        Christendom will be able to bring her back."</font><br>
      <font color="#cccccc">I wonder why it's not easy to find the
        poetic version of the whole fairy-tale, but that's the way it is
        in the Joseph Jacobs's collection:
        https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7439/7439-h/7439-h.htm</font><br>
      <br>
      and as I promised in the very finale of vol.1 I did go to jews and
      when I discussed with them the way I circle round the field to
      find more and more, I noticed that my hand went "widershins", the
      counter-clockwise. And this word tells that counter-clockwise is
      the direction outside. And by that road clock-wise will be into
      the church, so in this way крёстный ход перед входом в церковь
      должен быть по солнцу, а выходить из церкви против солнца? Я
      уверен, в церковной литературе лежит весь ход религиозной мысли по
      причине которого пришли к сегодняшней традиции водить хороводы
      отворотные.<br>
      231 gates tell that one direction is delight while the opposite is
      plague. <br>
      And plague was in the past, so when I showed the "deeper and
      deeper" thing, I probably went into the past with my thought. And
      indeed, counter-clockwise goes to the left at it's top and they
      say our timeline is left to right (at least for those who read and
      write left to right. semitic way of writing from right to the left
      may make them enmious with the rest of the world, because their
      eye-movements are the opposite of outs, and we trust them when
      they lie, yet we distrust them when they speak the truth. <font
        color="#cccccc">Huh, that's unexpected. I find it as I write.
        Before I stumbled across it, I&nbsp; </font><br>
      And that sentence promises delight in the future, which is only
      natural.<br>
      Because delight is what I saw to be happening in my capsules,
      where each move will lead to ecstasy.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      When I speak of morphemes, people tend to ask if I speak of the
      roots, but aphexes may matter more: <br>
      ушёл убежал улетел умчал убрался и так далее - приставка самая
      важная часть этих глаголов по смыслу, потому что смена приставки
      может изменить это слово на антоним. у is probably the same u as
      in away and out. It's funny that I don't immediately see it
      neither in прочь not in долой, but I definitely see it in вон.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      And that probably relates to в (in) relating to bu (no) as if at a
      hunt, there's no animal, if the animal is hidden in the ground
      somewhere.<br>

      New high session. Saturday, to my surprise. I didn't manage to
      give up weed, because I have broken my motivation by not paying
      back my brother his due. I made an unhonorable misdeed by not
      sticking to the verbal contract, and now I cannot do it because
      the state took him away. And I have to smoke to create this
      research instead of building my capsule. If I began building my
      capsule, I'd surely be sober more likely. I don't need being high
      to build that. Unfortunately, it seems I must smoke weed to be
      auistic enough to write this thing. It takes me many years now,
      some people wrote that ten or even twenty years it took some
      scientists to come up with their righteous theories. So I make it
      publicly for over 7 years now, so I expect it to bring fruits in
      over 2 years or so. I also made it secretly for over ten years
      before that. So <font color="#cccccc">in </font>2024 or 2025 <font

      abe iotu would be the words if we wanted to combine those five
      vowels, b and t into one word, the best I could do is two. abey
      jotu. obey to a jew? <br>
      <br>
      abei otu abei lotu (l ~ I) these words I pull out of the blue. I
      try them on. If they're no good I will look for something more,
      don't worry about it, please.<br>

      I didn't speak enough about what I did here.<br>

      I think I took the 16-rune set as they present it and found that A
      and E is the same Ææ<br>
      that is why B rune looks like F in the short twig variant:<br>
      <img src="12_files/younger_futhark_runic_alphabet.jpg" alt=""
        width="422" height="267"><br>
      And luckily it is a 16-rune sent, and I see that it doesn't hae e
      or g.<br>
      Thus my arrangement seems to be even more based than I even
      thought.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">Looking at old russian flag, I see notes of
        german flags. Only then I see that those brown flags (russian
        wite black yellow is even more brown than white black red, and I
        see that russian flag in modern german one, only whites are
        substituted with the reds. </font><br>

        I should stop trying to contact religious people. As one pastor
        told me, religions are to control the masses, not to understand
        the world. Maybe professional jews are the smartest believers,
        htey're believers nevertheless, so I will confuse their belief
        system. I wanted to say that something is wrong with them, but
        yes, this argument is much more important (was something wrong
        with me when I believed? I wouldn't think so, other than the
        assumption was thoroughly arbitrary, just as what if, let's
        learn to believe. Let's learn to believe. Belief can take towns.
        Often it took towns down. <br>
        <br>
        Mye will e is good. But you know how they say of the good

      Interesting is the way that reconstructed order of younger futhark
      lays down into the axial structure:<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      It's as if ᛅ is a form of ᚾ and we have ourself three
      5-letter-long lines with t reflecting f and d reflecting g and
      what else? <br>
      I would replace the ᛦᚱ with ᚱᛦ, actually the way they're in
      bornholm alphabet stone. Because ᛦ is transliterated as R and my
      bold guess is that ᚱ is П, mistransliterated because of how much ᚱ
      reminds R. Yet it's not a coincidence, because russian R looks
      like Р. <font color="#cccccc">(and even without the dot)</font><br>
      And now I see that then ᛘ reflects ᛦ<br>
      and ᚼ for sh reflects ᛋ for s.<br>
      But then again I doubt I cannot compare anything. So let's leave
      this ultracomparativistics and stick to new and more certain
      technics: the classical comparatevistic techniques of comparing
      words, not letters. Even if those words are the same letter. As I
      did with a and others in the previous volume, as I promised in the
      beginning of this one, at this stage we deliver the same
      comparison at much larger scale and with much more advanced
      technology.<br>

      but how dare I use slavic for the latin alphabet? Maybe because I
      допускаю этрусские корни у славян. Хотя мне присылали книгу где
      связывали этрусков с кельтами, но кто знает нет ли генетической и
      культурной связи меж ирландцами и руснёй. И те и другие вполне
      по-европейски выглядят, и вроде странная русская р у них тоже
      присуствует, или это у шотландцев, или у обеих наций, ах я не
      знаю, ололо. Это всё в любом случае голословно, так what are you

      И позиция фишек будет правильной или неправильной, если ты
      повернёшь их в ту или не ту сторону. В советской торговли счёты
      располагались фишками справа. Т.о. поворот посолонь скидывал счёты
      в начальное положение.&nbsp; <br>

      all videos in russian and ukrainian I saw show them arranged like
      that.<br>
      <br>
      Существует традиция, скидывающая счёты и в другую сторону,
      практически любое видео на английском распологает её с другой
      стороны, так что сброс будет против часовой, но я не нашёл видео с
      практическим применением оного, так что я решил оставить вам
      разобрать это самим, кто знает насколько компетентны те
      ютуб-блоггеры, и не попугайничают ли они друг за другом.<br>
      <br>
      Забавно, что японские счёты располагают строки вертикально, также
      как и классическое китайское письмо, но в отличие от него они
      похоже начинают счёт слева:<br>

      (сбрасываются они специальной кнопкой, так что вращение к ним
      неприменимо.<br>
      и не только японцы так ими пользуются, но похоже что и индусы и
      многие другие англоязычные, оставлю эту тему тоже пока что в
      стороне)<br>

      turd~dirt (probably these are cognates with for whatever reason

      şi is and in romanian. These short words, which are monoliteral in
      some languages are the key to finding the other short words of
      that monosyllabic period. And then we'll link these words to
      chinese hieroglyphics. Showing how the same sounds spread through
      all the other conceptions.<br>

      The way words can be the same in languages of different "family"

      they say.<br>

      is it some case english philology doesn't know much about. её?
      isn't it how they make accusative in japanese? Did this o work

      Many slavic languages have identical prepositions and even when
      they seem to not know some forms, they're still found in some
      biliteral: polish doesn't know k, but uses ku instead (russians
      use both к and ко, and that ko shows that it is exactly
      internationally known co- prefix, which is to also because some
      languages prefer до (do) intead of that ku, prefer d to c, and
      here we see how alphbaet could be the collection of these short
      words. And yet I wonder how could it be that в is not known in
      english)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Why do I rely on this random collection of the shortest words. I
      have to call my partner in this to tell him that I need my program
      now to make my own collection of these words.<br>

      Because 3 ~ З.<br>
      and now I see that IVX would be more traditional form of those.<br>
      and yet that AVZ I came upto is probably how that IVX was read.<br>
      I as ay or aye?<br>
      V as in? в (yet what is вон? I thought it was related to out and
      away, but it seems -он is no.<br>
      X as out? ex<br>
      <br>
      <i>вон</i> as <i>not inside</i> hypothesis.. <br>
      гон это то, что не пойдёт?<br>
      alone = al(l are) no(t her)e<br>
      tone = не тёмный? or to- as dye? but that would have some opposite
      meaning. I shouldn't stretch it this much.<br>

        is some weird chinese vowel for duh. as if it's yeah but in such
        wild chinese phonology, it's weirder than ы.<br>
        <br>
        both d and j are lingual, so what do I worry? they're from
        different lines, that's all, different dialects but the same
        word. Language is thousand-head chimera, words are much less
        abstract thing. Words are much more real. Words exist throughout
        languages. It's not how many languages you know, it's how many
        words you recognize across cultures. <br>
        <br>
        Modern academia is supported by go-t, and thus socialistisch,
        and as a result, ineffective. When business makes science, they
        make much better job about it. Human Genome was a private
        initiative, which go-t only tried to subvert. Was successful in
        spite of go-t.<br>

        n and m are the labial, reflecting b, бв, and thus they're bu,
        no, in- im- il- ir- all sonors are variants of one another,
        sonors before some letters stand:<br>
        il is only before l<br>
        ir is only beore r<br>
        (thus they don't matter much, they're.. or do they? they're some
        n's or m's I think. ᚱ as a form of ᚢ again.<br>
        im is before m, p, <br>
        un-is only n, unbelievable, <br>
        in is boefore v, t, c, d, <br>
        why does in- go un- before b? <br>
        u ~ i? <i>и</i> is i in russian.<br>
        so un is some basal form? because u is always with n in it,
        unlike i.<br>
        u and i are the pronouns? could be but then u ~ i and thus ya
        (you) ~ я [ya] (I) and that is how second person is whethere
        some pronoun of the first person or the third person (you or
        thee, we or they, you and we both could be some of uvw, the
        letter as a word. <br>
        <br>
        I as a form of U and thus A is a form of I and U, if the lines
        repeat themselves in differnt dialects, and thus c ~ g ~ з
        cognito сознаю. со ~ з?! what is наю then? как в наитие,

        Before I have that program, let's play as if I only know two
        languages because all the other languages are lost. Let's only
        play with russian and english. Or let's even start with only
        russain, because I know it the best.<br>

        Seeing how alphabet company colours remind my structure <img
          moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/alphabet_and_aeiou.png"
          alt="" width="225" height="119"> standing next to it in my
        favourites, made me play with my .ico a little and those letters
        again made me think of those timelines of AD and BC as if the
        modern AD period is how our laphabet goes: first line of it is
        A-D and then BC would be how itwas in the ancient past. B as the
        first letter, C as shin, and no air, just water of B and fire of
        C (ash) and if C is ash (I thought of shin as the sefer
        yetzirah's mother) and I see that thus C ~ H ~ X ~ ƆC and here I
        think of F ~ H and H as Ⱶ and maybe even as ᚴ<br>
        <br>
        I think I sent into google my book. Do they secretly read it and
        that is why they arranged colours like this? Alphbet they call
        themselves now. Whether because they're hijacking the term
        "alphabet agencies" or because they actually what.. they make
        business with my science simply because I use their services
        also for free. I even adblock the commercial on youtube and they
        seem to be fine with this. But if they read this book, I wonder
        why their G is so weird, as if it's asian k-first thing, but why
        does it go couter-clockwise then? Because if it's normal
        red-blue-and_so_on, then why does yellow goes after green? <br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/google_logo.jpg"
          alt="" width="48" height="48"> So I think it's
        counter-clockwise eastern canon. Do they wiz against them or do
        they just used the rainbow order going the way G goes, they
        didn't invent the letter, but then why doesn't their M follow
        the rainbow? <br>
        But visually it won't be better, if we go with our rainbow
        clockwise: <img moz-do-not-send="true"

        - without teeth I don't bite by own cheeks and lips.<br>
        - wihtout teeth I eat less. I need to remove them to balance my
        weight. I'm overweight all the time. it's almost 30 extra kilos,
        like wtf!<br>
        + teeth give some aestetic, but that's it. They also help to
        eat, but I see it as disadvantage in my case.<br>
        + they used to be used as instrument (to bite off something) but
        today metal instruments are to be used.<br>
        <br>
        That is actually one of the wilder inventions (or ideas) beyond
        the capsule thing. I see myself as closer to the embryo as
        possible, because I haven't seen the disadvantages of that state
        yet. That state seems to be the ultimate. The naturally
        developed state. Not chaos we're in. <br>

        The academic dogmas are so strong, that<br>
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Greek_alphabet#Hyginus'_account

















        <br>
        used to say literally the following:<br>
        <font size="+1">[[Hyginus]] recounts the following legend about
          the introduction of Phoenician letters to Greece</font><br>
        about this chapter:<br>
        <font size="+1">The three Fates created the first five vowels of
          the alphabet and the letters B and T. It is said that
          Palamedes, son of Nauplius invented the remaining eleven
          consonants. Then Hermes reduced these sounds to characters,
          showing wedge shapes because cranes fly in wedge formation and
          then carried the system from Greece to Egypt*. This was the
          Pelasgian alphabet, which Cadmus had later brought to Boeotia,
          then Evander of Arcadia, a Pelasgian, introduced into Italy,
          where his mother, Carmenta, formed the familiar fifteen
          characters of the Latin alphabet. Other consonants have since
          been added to the Greek alphabet. Alpha was the first of
          eighteen letters, because alphe means honor, and alphainein is
          to invent.</font><br>
        Naturally I had to change that line into<br>
        <font size="+1">[[Hyginus]] recounts the following legends about
          the development of the alphabet<br>
        </font><br>
        What if 'd in I'd is more based than had. The more basal, the
        more primitive, a part of had.<br>
        <br>
        Because that is literally -ed and thus it can be attached not
        only to verbs. I'd see would then means I saw? I did see? -ed is
        did? no, did is ed added to do. doed is did but oe's <br>
        s is present<br>
        d is past<br>
        l is future<br>
        all three suffixes are lingual, I wonder why. Maybe because they
        used to be the same letter and divided into times later. <br>
        Object's something<br>
        Object'd something<br>
        Object'll something<br>
        that -ing in the first case is like someth's a verb.<br>
        is and was - the other way to turn present into past. And I
        don't see not future form in this system, and thus this sistem
        is more ancient and from times where we didn't know future. No
        wonder those legends of ясновидящих appeared, and in russian it
        specifies: not only seeing, but seeing clear (and not a word
        about the future too, because those detectives could see into
        both futue and the past)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;clairvoyant is the english word, even though it's french.
        And a complete calque in russian.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Japanese ie for yea and iie for не makes me speculate:<br>
        is their no literally да-да? and is it standing for take and
        give (two times da, where da is ta in take and да in дай. and is
        that <i>g</i> (russina д looks like this in cursive) is <i>д</i>
        in times when we considered all the linguals one or few letters
        and didn't distinguish between give and take, because it is the
        same action actually. And were ke in take and ve in give the
        prefixes we know in russian in their pure forms of в &amp; к? <br>
        <br>
        v and k are they not only in and to, but also вы and ik?<br>
        <br>
        so ta is da (duh) <br>
        and take is ta ik (I give, даю я)<br>
        and give is ga U (give you, да<font color="#cccccc">й</font> вы)<br>
        <br>
        and most probably those are the same g and д (g is д in russian
        cusive, they both are and thus they remind cursive ד (looks like
        3 with a bubble at the cenral bridge) while ג and ז look like
        mirror reflections of each-other, which relates to that c ~ g
        thing (so I take from modern "dogmas" what I find fit and reject
        what doesn't fit into my theory, how convenient. So I banter
        myself too, so when I banter you please take it easy) <br>

        because what follows is they admit that funk is an euphemism for
        fuck. So are folk music fuck music? Makes sense for rhythm could
        be invented to keep the lovers in the same tempo. And thus they
        would speed at the same time and came to the culmination at the
        same moment. <br>
        Or is it the same word, because fucks is what folks do, and thus
        that's how they're different from their children. And once
        children got puberty, and thus both interest and ability to have
        sex, they soon become folks themselves.<br>

        rave and rake? more obscure words return more obscure results.<br>
        <br>
        but stave and stake are great. <br>
        So these pairs are great for learning the language, but we
        descend even further into the past and thus we know what exactly
        is in there and we have to learn only about tens of morphemes,
        maybe only two and the others are the further implications of
        those. We'll see. yin-yang model seems to be in the root of it
        all, I yet have to reach it from the point of modern lexics. I
        jumped into the future of my work, but now I wonder if it
        doesn't disturb the truth I yet have to deliver, if my
        preconceptions won't distort it.<br>
        <br>
        but slave and have don't have the pairs with ke as far as I can

        когда как в фамилиях I know surnames ending with вец, but not
        nets. Even Lenny and Nina are Кравец, где вец тот же самый вич
        как в петрович, диалектные различия невелики. <br>
        Вери блади сёрнэйм иф зэт крев из славик. ик вик тот же самый
        вич и виц. вик. вый is also in this band. and that is how k is
        among i's. and if l is in this I-gang, I look at -el suffix and
        ask is it a varinat of -вич? but the closest to -el I can do is
        in мишкин is михайлов is михайлович.<br>
        so what is -ич and why do we need it? it's их. их как ich?
        товарищ товарич. я шутил что тваричи, но товаричи, их родители
        лишь товар. их родителей продали как товар. <br>
        <br>
        -in is that very n of нец которое вец, в которая in. I don't

        in russia we have two types of surnames: ending with ov/ёv/ev

        ukraian surnames are usually attached to -en ~ -in.<br>
        is -ov surnames add v to that very o?<br>
        okolniko doesn't look like ukraian surname, it would probably be
        okolnika in there. some surnames of the region end with -a
        gangha (ganzha) is my favourite. ganghin it would be in russian,

        ABGD makes more sense than ABCD because they say that it was

        faith. But not to be that scientist, I must dig that claim, o

        gives it in the reference, then dig further for he reference,
        maybe also to see a hearsay.<br>
        <br>
        ABGD makes more sense, because then we see more clearly that
        it's voiced before voiceless, and we see it in russian more than
        in hebrew or greek even. Which tells that maybe russians are

        through our eyes and ears and nostrils. and multitude of other
        sensors.<br>

        as if mix-up voiced and voiceless, making the alphabet balanced,
        or what was the direction? Maybe the russians inventors decided
        to arrange letters in that order? But ABGD in greek too. Did it
        happen in greek or is it the source of their dogma that latin
        had ABGD in the beginning too, because they took it from greeks.
        Probably. so, did they or did they not? Greeks and russians have
        more distorted abcd sequences, thus they were the ones who
        mutilated it for their new structure, voiced first, voiceless
        later. In military sense it would make sense, because
        avant-guarde has to call all the others, and they should have
        been there as fans but also to protect their star. <br>

        I marked those "sonors" in orange. The first of them, Й, is
        literally short I (И-краткое)<br>
        And L is probably a form of I and thus N ~ И (in both form and
        function: 'n' is и)<br>
        и ~ на? n is no or and? an? a is an, and? a is and in other
        language, in russians. <br>
        But fuck that meme. rus is trus and village people. slavs are
        slaves. Let's invent something else. Parmiaks. Пермяками быть

        Greek ΖΗΘΙΚΛΜΝ sequence reminds russian ЗИЙКЛМН only russians
        removed their Ѳ and among that the sequences are pretty much the
        same: Η after Ζ is naturally russian И after З. <br>
        and it is wonderful how they disagree about which is I and which
        is J. <br>
        Russians left only H vowel, greeks have both H and I vowel
        actualy, but I before K is Й before К.<br>
        <br>
        ΖΗΘ is substituted with ЁЖЗ in russian <br>
        H is ᚼ(or ᛡ) in norsk.<br>
        and З is naturally Ζ<br>
        thus Ё is Θ<br>
        they made рокировку () in greece? or in russia? latin doesn't
        have that mess. And russian second line is surprisingly close to
        latin than to greek:<br>
        EFGH<br>
        ЕЁЖЗ - but no, it's not, here I must explain why we have ז<br>
        ה ו ז ח ט<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; h g f e<br>
        hebrew seems to have ו ז ח ט both and modern greek doesn't have
        the first labial, modern latin doesn't have the last one. I
        guess it's the same labial (one per line) and for whatever
        reason voiced and voiceless was divided here, is it where the
        voiceless set appeared, and before that 7 letters were enough.<br>
        maybe even six if only plosives and glides they were, teh first
        two lines, but there're thre aettirs, but four (or even five, if
        you accept the fifth) aikme<font color="#cccccc"> or is it
          aikmen, I am still lost in their grammar, I don't know it
          plain and simple.</font><br>
        So like yin and yang, there used to be two lines: voiced and
        voiceless, syllabary of two vowels. A and E<br>
        or A and U in other nations, and somehow those u and и (u and и)
        met and gave offsprings, and thus five vowels. AUI pure vowel,
        labial and lingual vowels, the ogham order of vowels, and nobody
        else's, as far as I know so far.<br>
        so there were three parents to two children? e is between a and
        i (ai is e in some orthography, but not english, the best
        english can offer is said.<br>
        au is o<br>
        that is how letters came into being.<br>
        But creative force didn't stop there, and people found я in ia
        and ю in iu and ui is probably w.<br>
        <br>
        if ui is w, then i is short, as in i-short, short, like mice say
        i, but elephants say u. <br>
        u is labial for big<br>
        i is lingual for short<br>
        Hobot rassmatrivalsa kak guba? guba truba? <br>
        <br>
        vowel as no: to omit (not to mention)<br>
        tion is деяние<br>
        dios thus is doing, doer, creator.<br>
        deus thus is деющий<br>
        -s as active suffix, -ing<br>
        -n is passive suffix -ed<br>
        and though all four are lingual, ing and n are closer to m then
        to s, and what does it tell? maybe nothing, keep on digging.<br>
        done gone, these ancient words have very peculiar form of -ed.<br>
        russian form, the form russians still use. so was -ed -eл (д and
        л look alike in both kirillica and glagollica: ⰄⰎ - and the
        first sign usually has the left bubble half the hight, as others
        of that sight, but unicode makers chose this, later, form of it,
        the one used into modern times by srbsk-hrvatsk brothers) <br>
        So what I say? that d and l are invariants? I love this
        irrational word. l is russian d is english? <br>
        dark mrak seem to push l further, not into n, but m.<br>
        rak could be as in zrak (pupil of the eye) который от слова зри
        (see) зрак зрящий, seeing.<br>
        зрачок маленький зрак, как значок маленький знак. и это ко то же
        что и в японском. Даже не столько слова существуют, сколько вот
        такие корокие силлабеллы. silly bellies, silly because we think
        they mean nothing, or they mean too much, so we recognize them
        as silly, purely phonetic. <br>
        And they used to mean something, neh, but in different contexts
        they're understood as whole words without minding the components
        of those words. The linguistic problem of correct and wrotng
        words was known in ancient times, not anymore. Those quests were
        probably labeled obsolete or heretical and only post-christian
        science was accepted as valuable source. Yet linguistics is not
        where it should be, machine learning is completely independent
        field, and they reported linguists only harmful to their
        science, thus linguistics is pseudo-science<font color="#999999">
          (mostly because they're very reluctant to question their
          dogmas <font color="#cccccc">(my guess is because those dogma
            are political in nature)</font>)</font> And declaring this I
        dare to what.. I dare to say that my clumsy steps are the
        foundation of the truer science about language. What should I
        call them? grammatology is a shitty term from the start, and
        it's taken by the thieves, so let's find something else:<br>
        let's make some poetry.<br>

        What interests me in that picture the most is the way they draw
        three signs in dots, and they're alphabetic:<br>
        one dot for M<br>
        two dots for H<br>
        three dots for I<br>
        and because both those diacritized M and H stand before K, I
        consider all three of those letters be considered vowel. Labial
        vowel first, Lingual vowel last, the neutral vowel between them,
        but we must hear how those letters are pronounced to claim
        anything about them.<br>
        But it's not that easy to find anybody pronouncing those
        letters. And most of the scholars don't seem to know of those
        vowel M and H.<br>
        <br>
        Those dots actually once again link brahmic to one
        geographically distinct writing system, the Tifinagh.<br>
        But unicode doesn't deliver those dot-signs for brahmic, the
        only dot signs it shows are these:<br>
        &nbsp; 𑀀𑀁𑀂&nbsp; 𑀇&nbsp; 𑀈<br>
        𑀇 is i<br>
        𑀈 is ī (and looks differently in other fonts, as | with dots on
        both sides, like ⴶ with those dots not on the top, but at the
        middle of that |, somewhat higher than in .|. (just in case,
        here it is supposed to look as four dots in the shape of a
        square. And because it's some form of i, it is interesting that
        actually tifinagh ⴶ&nbsp; is dʒ, just as j, which is also a form
        of i.<br>
        𑀀𑀁𑀂 sign seem to be some diacritic (because it loks like this
        in other font:&nbsp; and it is not on wiktionary, and that is
        how deep I dig. Not very deep.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        So I was looking for those kshatrapa, junnar, andhra, but those
        dots are not there, yet some curious stuff can be found by those
        key words. For example, this:<br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naneghat"><img
            moz-do-not-send="true"
src="12_files/1911_sketch_of_numerals_script_history_ancient_India,_mathematical_symbols_shapes.jpg"
            alt="" width="1208" height="614" border="0"></a><br>
        <br>
        and watching the abundance of the used signs in
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_script I once again remeber
        that enormous list of very different post-brahmic scripts and
        once again think that the east could easily be the source of all
        the writing systems, so many of them it has.<br>
        <br>
        But then I see some <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G50nq68VPuM"><font
            color="#000000">hindu</font></a> telling that India has not
        one, but two sources of literacy: brahmi that was written left
        to right and kharoshti, which was written right to left, and I
        look into kharoshti, and I find that double dot H: <br>
        𐨏&nbsp;&nbsp; which is called visarga:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visarga<br>
        (and there you can see that it's not only horizontal, but
        vertical too)<br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharosthi"><img
            moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/hindi_diacritics.png"
            alt="" width="1148" height="597" border="0"></a><br>
        <br>
        <font size="+1">The precise phonetic function of the dot below
          is unknown. It is used with m and h</font><br>
        <font color="#999999">(and probably that m is the same m which
          that table where it all began from mentions)</font><br>
        But why would I look into kharoshti when I needed to find some
        brahmi?<br>
        Most of all because I'm desperate because I didn't find them in
        brahmic scripts, and whatever.<br>
        Why do I look into writing systems I don't know much about? I am
        so much out of my depth.<br>
        I told myself I have to leave it to ai, but I'm whether proud or
        obey to the habit way too much.<br>
        I will take a toke and look into something else, you watch me:<br>
        <br>
        Ohay, and our later and I fuck up al the academia<br>

        I'm waiting for some better program about these graphs, I have a
        prototype of it, it even works:<br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph1english.png"
          alt="" width="764" height="518"><br>
        It probably was some academic text, they are taught not to use
        I's. weird, huh. make them selfless.<br>
        but check the biliteral words from the same text (the lists are
        not complete, just the most often ones.<br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph2.png" alt=""
          width="778" height="536"><br>
        No me's (but few my's) definitely something academic.<br>
        Compare it with the previous example, obviously less prudent:<br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true"

          width="790" height="536"><br>
        Different texts, different in size also, slightly different
        results, but the first three words are the same.<br>
        of to in.<br>
        But because of their similarity and symmetry I only look at of
        and to, because they're the good two mothers ot the shortest
        english word a. what is I then? the a and I probably were the
        first two vowels:<br>
        they make great syllabary, because i palatalizes lettes while a
        does not.<br>
        and u the opposite of their spectre probably appeared when the
        concept of second person appeared.<br>
        <br>
        of and to show the opposite direction. of you or to you. of me
        or to me. take is to thee? ke as the opposite of ik? give is
        that ke and vi is me? where's ta in give? I thought both t and g
        are d, some do.. or дай (give) <br>
        дай ~ дей (деть наоборот брать, а не дать "куда дели" where did
        you place it, so in this sense also where did you give it?<br>
        давать девать<br>
        одевать. положить вокруг себя? о ~ около ~ om (in dutch)<br>

        As you can see, the program is raw, I requested it to be
        improved so I enjoy working with it.<br>
        <br>
        also not all of those words are actually words:<br>
        — : 2<br>
        – : 2<br>
        и : 319<br>
        а : 82<br>

        г : 1<br>
        <br>
        ф is from <font size="+1">германските воени групи Е и Ф</font><br>
        w is from some <font size="+1">W0506</font><br>
        д is also some personal.. they call it proper noun, such a term
        for personal memes <font size="+1">Денот Д</font><br>
        <br>
        и = and<br>
        a = and (but) another and, with a little bit of but in it. more
        butty but is но (no)<br>
        е = is<br>
        <br>
        google translate doesn't tell me of their а today, but it knows
        it because it translates sentences with that word well:<br>

        на is translated as of in that sentence, so even though they're

        slavic languages:<br>
        oд and до in makedonian is от и до ин рашшн.<br>
        That scarcity of to can be very important to understand our
        mentality. But let's feed there some other text, some scientific
        text in makedonian. Or fuck makedonian, lets' work in russian,
        at least I know that.<br>
        <br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph1russian.png"
          alt="" width="1634" height="581"><br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph2russian.png"
          alt="" width="1634" height="605"><br>
        I didn't know that na (on) is so popular in slavic languages,
        even though that book (собачье сердце) doesn't have the jewish
        -please (-na) which is considered rune in russian as if that -na
        is nahooy (to penis, yet that to is also на in russian)<br>
        And now, in that book and in russian the most popular words are
        the same as in that makedonian text, but now they're in
        alphabetic order: и, во, на (vowel, labial, lingual, in this
        order)<br>
        So for some better comparison, I use the very same book in
        english translation:<br>
        russian: <font size="+1">http://www.eunet.lv/library/win/BULGAKOW/dogheart.txt</font><br>
        english: <font size="+1">https://archive.org/stream/MikhailBulgakovTheHeartOfADog/Mikhail-Bulgakov-The-Heart-Of-A-Dog_djvu.txt</font><br>
        and to my surprise in gets up front, leaving those to and of
        behind:<br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph1english...png"
          alt="" width="1634" height="584"><br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph2english...png"
          alt="" width="1634" height="618"><br>
        and the most popular of all short words, the a, of, to, arranged
        in alphabetic order, btw, lead the charts.<br>
        it's interesting that in russian the leaders are also arranged
        alphbaetically: и(i) в(v) на(na) (and, in, on)<br>
        in that makedonian text (some other text, in some different
        genre) the first three were the same, but in different order:
        на, во, и.<font color="#999999"> (в and во are the same word in
          russian<font color="#cccccc"> (like a and an in english)</font>)</font><br>
        And yes, there are more frequent words in that text:<br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph3english...png"
          alt="" width="4749" height="589"><br>
        That and is the very russian и and their the russians don't have
        is the leader of them all. which is really super weird. About
        2.5 times more the's than a's. <br>
        a : 934<br>
        the : 2358<br>
        an : 92<br>
        Even with an, the is more than twice as often as a and an
        combined.<br>
        <font color="#999999">Is it because in that book objects are
          named three times? Once when they're not known and twice
          later?</font><br>
        Just to compare it to russian to see that no russian word of
        three letters can compete with the shorter ones, from the same
        book, the leaders are still и, во, на:<br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph3russian.png"
          alt="" width="5150" height="637"><br>
        This part is so boring to me, because there has to be hundreds
        of these graphs and some cold-hearted machine should be
        analyzing them. While I'm already tired of these few and try to
        pull assumptions from these few too: that на is also used not
        only for on, but also for take. And that fact makes me think if
        во has some meaning of give, like as if во is мо<font
          color="#cccccc">ё</font> or фу (don't take)<br>
        <br>
        I doubt I should do it, that's not what it was about. Or was it?
        Time to smoke, Good morning. 12:24, Tuesday (it's Thursday, I
        was even unaware of that) I'm not giving it up because I don't
        have nothing better to do, and I have nothing better to do
        because I smoke and thus cannot deal with some serious people I
        have to deal. Few hours later and I haven't smoked yet. But it
        is coming. <br>
        another hour passed, and I made some heavy work (I would never
        do it being high, way to heavy, way too brutal, some minor
        damage to my skin is caused by it, some dirty air breathed in,
        totally counter-survival. completely against the main idea of
        mine that perfect condition will maybe allow us not to get old,
        or at least not to die of some other factors, and aging will be
        solved by biotech, and probably it already is, btw. I only have
        to earn much money in time to get it.<br>
        <br>
        And here I am at 15:22 with such a subject as матерные слова.<br>
        For some long time I suspect that some words were considered
        dirty because they were too basal, too picturesque, or for
        whatever reason, it could be just a demonstration of power when
        people were prohibited to speak their own language, I have an
        anecdotal evidence about it from some iranian gay man. <br>
        16:30 I was out, reading more about Solzhenitsyn than himself.<br>
        16:59 and I'm reading this:<font size="+1">

        It seems that work damaged my creativity by taking my powers to
        make it. That is why I cannot have a job (an hour long hand
        labour is the easiest job of all and still it takes this sparkle
        out of me. Let's smoke more maybe? Let's try regain hat spark.
        Let's eat first. Or drink lots of water. I eat a jelly and drink
        some warm water, and maybe I will not smoke anymore, to be
        continued.<br>
        And there he makes the same misdead I do: we don't mind
        collaborating with the regime. He actually use the perestroica
        term. He gave them a clue to survive into 21th century. They had
        to fall and jews would perish when archives were open, people
        would start asking why the fuck there were so many jews,
        unproportionally many, and they wouldn't even get to who were
        the other half of the mother fuckers (old russian elite) before
        they slaughtered kikes (who reasonable left before perestroika
        pretending to be russians and giving russians bad
        reputation.&nbsp; These love-hate parasite-host relations will
        always exist and always conclude the seed of the military or
        civil conflicts. So what is the solution for it would be? My
        grmmar is grate.<br>
        <br>
        I ate and drank but I still discuss politics instead of science.
        That is how dumbened down I am by that heavy duty work. I should
        stope pretending that I'm a.. I wanted to say that I should stop
        being an architect, but I actually have to build with hired
        workers' menpower.<br>
        Or I have to avoid weed when I do heavy work, because it will
        not help me to ascend where I'm allowed in some other days.

        Так почему же Солженицын заигрывает с советской властью? Только
        ли ради радения о русских или то лишь предлог? Может он
        позиционировал себя и кем-нибудь воспринимался как внештатный
        аналитик, ведь как писал Гиммлер, советская власть сама
        организует протесты против себя. И в отличие от Амальрика (о
        котором я лишь от него узнал, при том что того выпустили из
        тюрьмы народов на мой месяц рождения (не знаю точного дня когда
        он выехал)<br>
        Амальрик, возможно, не заигрывал, и кто знает истинные причины
        его смерти спусты четыре года после освобождения. Солженицын не
        только выжил, но был и тепло принят путиным. Я, значит, не
        заигрываю с властью? И он и я заигрывать с ней вынуждены, потому
        что, как он справедливо заметил, на восстание русского народа
        надежды нет: их волю сломили, и если они не быковали когда их
        пиздец крепили, то теперь-то чего, типа после драки кулаками не
        машут.<br>
        Лишь надежда на очередного Хрущёва у него, и через десять лет
        доставили Горбачёва. Какой ещё лысый гад нас освободит от
        режима? Лысый у нас сейчас, но это ленинообразная фигура,
        паутинный персонажик. Следующий будет волосатый, и нам очень
        повезёт если навального поставят, хотя я и воспринимаю его тоже
        как пример власти, организующей протесты против себя самой. Дабы
        выявить ех, кто в этом многострадальном народе ещё способен
        помыслить о сопротивлении.<br>
        <br>
        оберечь или обречь (первое слово очень редкое, морфологически
        вполне понятное, но у солженицына прочитал его впервые за долгое
        время, так что сложно было понять как обречь, почему обречь. а..
        оберечь. Но что если это subliminal programming of some sort?
        What if he winks them that finally this zaraza will hit the
        opponents of ours, the progressive west (I suspect progressive
        to be some marker word: neither progressive metal nor
        progressive trance are good) so I believe in the good old west.
        Simply being the best and doing what it can the best. No more
        brother wars this time.<br>
        Do I promote wars with some other races? We never had much
        interest fighing other races. Or am I ignoring the conquests of
        Cyberia and America? The imperialist in me.. We have to outlaw
        all wars. Violence is abhorent, and then we have to prevent
        go-ts from commiting it against their citizens. They're
        independent persons, they don't belong to the state. But what am
        I going to do to criminals? <br>
        I'm going to expose them so all their sins will be available to
        everybody doing business with them.<br>
        What if they ignore it and openly exterminate the opposition?
        Isn't it what the go-t does? <br>
        Okay, I dropped reading solzhnitsyn's letter in the middle. His
        demand to develop the north-east, because we didn't develop is
        enough is atrocious. He definitely works for the commies. He
        teaches them how to reign us better. He told them to reject the
        ideology, they did. He told them to stop the progress, to make
        economy static, and that seems to be what they did. And what if
        that was how he fucked them up. What if that good advice to
        reject the stale ideology was just a bait to make them fall into
        some static state, which would make them incompetent to compete
        with the West. Could be, could be. But they were failing to
        compete beofre that, don't I think? It certainly was a trick. I
        rejected to read it more, but how did it sound almost fifty
        years ago? <br>
        So, finally I read it through and I can see that soviet
        establishment definitely read that letter. <br>

        is it.. pas and cul?<br>
        pas as advantage makes pastures very important for success. <br>
        cul for as makes our civilization very homosexual. but probably
        culture is what's cool.<br>
        Is cool some ancient word for good? I don't know and actually
        doubt it. But as I spoke about unofficial languages, those words

        I felt like I needed some pictures and I found these two I used
        before, now let's compare them side by side:<br>

        They're mostly coherent, yet they're different. The one on the
        right gives some minority report about Η and unlike the table on
        the right it tells that they all (and Ionian too) considered Η
        consonant. And both pictures agree that only ionian knew Ω which
        may show that first the priests of apollo (probably being
        ionian) added only one string to apollo's lyre. And that was
        long o? Because if both these tables are correct, they speak
        about different epochs maybe. But then again there's replication
        crisis and we can only be sure that Η and Ω are the two
        additional strings. Maybe Η was more high than Ι and Ω was twice
        deeper than Ο, and what was Υ then who knows, but what am I
        doing, let's greeks decide it. Those who feel that language.<br>
        Other differences are about the use of that ☉-like Θ, how did
        they draw Ι in korinth, and others are some minor differences
        about some additional forms, such as Υ and D.<br>

        speaking of me trying to unite all the languages could be not

        I just noticed that they claim that the idea that the universe
        had no beginning and came out of nothing belongs to hawking. It
        is how they rewrite history, because while hawking was alive, he
        was considered to be the most vocal proponent of the big bang
        theory, which I noticed before (could be some vaticanese
        conspiracy) Do they keep some roman relics which allows them the
        world power? Some extraterrastrial technology of actually
        speaking to gods? whoever they were? some aliens working towards
        peace for their own convenience.<br>
        <br>
        So did hawking accept the opposite point of view or do they just
        fail to prevent us from noticing that their big bang dogma is
        inconsistent when looked at without some dialectics. dialieticks<br>
        <br>
        So now they will use принцип арнольда (different name in english
        by an accident or to divide national languages when they can?)
        to hide figures who proponed the bettery cosmology all along to
        conceal how they were shut down or what else they could say.

          Cancer goes next, and thus A B G C is how it goes, and if g

          Leo (L as D, interesting)<br>
          Virgo is Deva. And isn't L there because of L Г ()
          simmilarity? Because L is between C and D was born (Λ and Δ
          have lots in common too. and this Λ Δ order made me thnk that
          this could be a great sequence, where \ would be B, which
          would explain I for Z in ancient greek and check out the
          phoenician second line: 𐤄 𐤅 𐤆 𐤇 𐤈 something z-like for
          zain, Ч-like У I was looking for in the middle of for elements
          water notebook. E almost exactly like latin. So it seems
          phoenician is not hebrew indeed. What if they arranged hebrew
          alphabet to phoenician which indeed was an ancient incarnation
          of the alphabet as we know it, with Ф already removed from
          it's labial position and M also as we know it.. wait, what am
          I talking about, seeing Ф in 𐤈 when they also have quite
          labial vav in 𐤅 if that is vav and not some J (but we're
          taught (told) that Ё after Е was inserted by some female
          queens relatively recently, after peter the great. <br>
          But even if I rename Virgo as Deva, I will have random
          disorder further down the line. And if I take the first half
          for whatever reason (7 were before 12, it was better before, I
          have no proof though - such non-arguments are no good and I
          think I don't use them above, so this self-irony is
          unadequate, though my grammar is naturally foreign and wrong
          here and there)<br>
          <br>
          So what am I saying? That 𐤄 𐤅 𐤆 𐤇 𐤈&nbsp; is read
          differently? That 𐤅 is not v, but some г? ʒ? to align it with
          russian ж з sequence? nonsense. It's more likely that 𐤈
          indeed was t? because it has t inside? because romans
          pronounce it with tongues? Or that hebrew alphabet is a
          fabrication, because bible doesn't include abecedaries. It's
          not in their canon, even though that satanic codex has
          abecedaries at its cover (I included it in some chaotic
          section, I don't feel well posting something that emotionally
          charged, so I leave it in the previous volumes and will link
          to it from here when I make this book right)</font><br>

        Creation of alphabet happened after the invention of ovens, so
        alphbet could appear even in iceland, in norsk legend of Odin
        inventing runes and dice together? They say three mothers were
        at the pit of the well the tree grew from, so three mothers were
        known. And the next iteration is believed to be 7 vowels, b and
        t, but then it was some different development of the alphbaet:
        vowels were invented after only three letters existed. And at
        first there were 3 vowels (because some cultures have only 3,
        and maybe even only 2: palatalizing and not palatalizing. Some
        cultures disagree about where to put diacritic marks for i and
        u: arabs mark i's by a dot below, and u's by the mark above
        them, which is counter-intuitive to europeans, but probably
        that's how it was: europeans are zombified by modern music
        theory: I had memories of disagreeing with high notes being weak
        and sharp and low notes being profound and powerful. For a child
        it would be natural the other way around (and some musician gave
        me his anecdotal first-hand evidence that he had this cognitive
        dissonance too) so twice in this day I come to the urge to
        research arabic alphabet, for arabic alphabet could be even more
        true than hebrew (but wait till you dig georgian: they have
        additional line and they did arrange those letters perfectly
        right, and that book of georgian language in georgian language
        arranges letters by abcd lines, which tells those fuckers know
        that structure even now. other nations seem not to) which can be
        whatever, from thsoe tricksters we should expect any fucking
        thing, good and bad too. they may be unpredictable and anything
        would fit them. I hope they have self-preservance, and play it
        masterfullyto be loved all of the sudden. They will probably be
        the first to mutate en masse, because that would give them
        evolutionary advantage, and thus they would begin the urge of
        modifications in peoples, and for that they will be adored by
        many, especially if they remove what we hate them for, I hop<font

        Academia is a union. They prevent people from out of their union
        to do the job. Unions are mafias.<br>
        <br>
        In soviet union, unions were subordinate to the state, to the
        employer. And how were they used? Naturally, they were working
        to control not the employer, but the employees: all those
        factory собрания после работы, после учёбы ли. <br>

        the hermeticism for my roof and I also bought paint and brush

        do re mi fa sol la si have interesting choice of vowels, as if
        it didn't go one way, but was some canonic melody:<br>
        do rE MI Fa sol lA SI (where syllables of the type aa are the
        lowest (in modern sense) and AA are the highest and aA and Aa
        are in between) and then it probably went as a wave in the form
        of N.<br>
        And knowng more canonic representation of it, I'd say that it
        was pentanonic up and down, like in this one: <br>

        and in my hypothesis those five notes were not chromatic, but
        nicely jumped to thirds to make five notes of what used to be
        only three grades, which is probably connected to the three
        accords as we know them, or maybe not, I don't know music well
        enough. But it would make a smoothest transition from three
        vowels to five of them.<br>
        I was thinking about something like this:<br>

        (click it, if the link's alive, there they even play it)<br>
        In the principle similar to what I saw in the greek modes
        sorting nodes into some up and down triads:<br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/071.jpg" alt=""
          width="756" height="317"><br>
        but looking for some other source for these tetrachords or
        whatever, I found this:<br>
        <font size="+1">Greek theory distinguished three different
          genera of tetrachords, producing an additional variety of
          modes. The previously described tetrachord (two descending
          whole tones plus one semitone) was called diatonic. There were
          also chromatic and enharmonic genera. The two tones bounding
          the tetrachord were fixed and always formed a perfect fourth;
          the two inner tones were movable. The chromatic tetrachord
          consisted of a minor third (encompassing 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
          whole tones) plus two semitones, the enharmonic tetrachord of
          a major third (encompassing two whole tones) plus two
          approximate quarter tones:<br>

        Those one-syllable sentences could lead me to some marrism. I'm

        them here for some ai-powered people who find normal literature
        boring read it in an evening) but when I'm ai-powered, I

        <font size="+1">Все слова всех языков имеют общее происхождение
          (моногенез), а именно от «четырёх элементов» — изначальных

          имевших никакого значения» и использовавшихся в магических
          целях); так называемая «лингвистическая палеонтология» может
          возвести любое слово к одному (или нескольким) из четырёх
          элементов. Это утверждение сочеталось с теорией изначальной
          множественности языков — несмотря на общий характер четырёх
          элементов, разные социальные группы придавали им разное
          значение. Способы выведения слов из «четырёх элементов» не
          носили сколько-либо строгого характера, на практике
          разрешались типичные для любительских упражнений в этимологии
          произвольные замены и перестановки звуков, отбрасывания частей
          слов (отождествлялись и возводились к элементу РОШ слова

        It is rather wicked, because if we align them as Ion, Ber, Rosh,
        Sal, we'll have something incredibly similar to alphabetic set,
        and because it's ABC, Ion, Ber, Sal, Rosh are also fine (or
        maybe not, because R stands before S) because ABC as a meme and
        many other sources suggest that&nbsp; only three elements used
        to be, but where does it lead me? Am I going to dig this
        stalinist piece of crap? I'm not, at least not yet. I told you,

        But then again, if these eastern and western signs are related,
        it's more likely that it went the other way around: european
        letters could be some simplistic phonetic chinese script. or had
        roots in it.<br>

        Мать расскаазала историю, что когда её вынули, бабушка
        спрашивает "а чего голова такая кривая?"врачи тогда взяли и
        вправили мозги помяв её как пластилин, почти нереальная, не
        поверил если бы сам от неё не слышал. И может это привело меня к
        изобретению тянуть себя за волосы. Если череп можно формировать
        как пластилин, то может сейчас его можно формировать как глину.
        Это же не обожённая в печи глина, это живая материя, лишь
        немногим жёщще хрящей. и то, что они решили, что по вертикальной
        нагрузке кость выдерживает автомобиль, то какой запас
        пластичности в той кости! это живая материя, и я уверен что она
        растягивается, но когда начал, я в этом не был уверен, и
        расчитывал на рост кости в области стыков, если я буду кости
        черепа в этом месте растягивать. Т.е. я уповал на ткань суставов
        (хотел сказать соединительная ткань, но кажется это не она,
        или.. рубцовая цкань была названа соединительной тканью в одной
        статье, я вообще не специалист в анатомии, но и тем не менее,
        кажется что ереп расширяется, я такой бошковитый и я слышу череп
        когда растягиваю его. на слух, тихие пощёлкивания, подобные
        которым, но гораздо более тихие можно вызвать напряжением мышц
        черепа в районе ушей. но помимо них, и если деалть какое-то
        время то только их - шумы как среднее между ветром и морем. ы-ы

        <br>
        fuck ipa again, because why learn their shorthand, when one can
        say "ы шёпотом" (у них наверняка и значка такого нет) но как я
        переведу ы шёпотом? не лучше ли диакритику для беззвучности
        придумать, а ы заменить тем значком, который для неё у ipa
        используется. I fuck ipa gently, because I find some good use in
        them: they're like mathematical signs for linguistic objects.<br>

        Words for work are longer in russian than in english:<br>
        perchatki instead of gloves<br>
        molotor instead of hammer<br>
        both are 3 syllables instead of two.<br>
        What if chinese have 1-syllable words for thise words? Is it why
        they're more workaholic?<br>
        <br>
        they have four-syllable word for it: 一個錘子, but one-syllable 錘 is
        also recognize as hammer, but it's as if it's not molotok, but
        molot, because molotok is small molot and 子 in 錘子 (molotok) is
        phonosemantically close to ok<font color="#cccccc"> (but
          actually only japanese ko, in chinese it's zы, as chi in
          molotochek, thus here I clame that chinese zы and japanese ko
          are cognates, unrecognizable cognates)</font> and it means
        child, co as chi in child. what is ld? люд? chi-nok?
        chi-rebchik, ребята же-ребята, по-русята, русь деревню значила в
        латыни.<br>
        錘 is chui, which is phonosemantically close to куй (kui, forge)<br>
        錘子 is (chuizы) is molotok (middle size hammer)<br>
        Ham is not the word, but I guess brits have a shorter word for
        hammer, or maybe no and thus chinese are more workaholic than
        them, or brits just love other instruments more: jack, saw, maul
        is the word, something larger than hammer is maul. now I wonder
        if mer in hammer is maul. if ha was chi or ha as in half.<br>
        <br>
        maul as in molot. mol is milling in russian too, but it's so
        rare now that we only know it in many words that have it in
        them: крупный помол, кофемолка, молоть.<br>
        <font color="#cccccc">and thus мол in молот is maul in mauls
          mauled mauler hamaul maulers hamauls mauling maulstick
          maulsticks <br>
          And to my surprise of these many words none. In some other
          orthography it is hiding. I never knew of maul as the root of
          молот before today. This cents to the collection I need to see

        Those мнов and тобов in comparison to russian мной and тобой

        is i in russian and ו is u in hebrew.<br>
        e is also among these things. Not only because e looks like i in

          and o is what all about that dot, and dot is usually placed in

        If I didn't know better, would I conclude that машина значит
        моющая, приведись мне через тысячу лет разбирать язык
        сегодняшний и обратить внимание на то, что плита и холодильник
        машинами не называются (в отличии от стиралки и посудомойки)
        сейчас-то я вижу, что машина это от слова моушн, движение (хотя
        холодильник гоняет движет хладагент, а плита электричество,
        движущихся деталей в ней нет (насос в компрессоре холодильника
        скрыт и невидим для конечного пользователя)<br>
        машина машинка машиночка этот ряд подобен тому молот молоток
        молоточек, только в женском роду, что есть маш? если мол молоть,
        то маш махать. х как все язычные имеет смысл, вспомнил ещё
        пример где он имеет смысл: то как переливается махать именно в
        значении motion. мах is also might? мощь. мощь is the root of
        motion? I don't know if americans recognize might as the root of
        motion, I wonder if it's recognized as the same word wherever
        that might comes and wherever the motion is derived: <br>
        <br>
        <font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; might (n.) "quality of being
          able, ability to do or act, power," Middle English might, from
          Old English miht, earlier mæht "bodily strength, power;
          authority, dominion, control; ability," from Proto-Germanic
          *makhti- (source also of Old Norse mattr, Old Frisian, Middle
          Dutch, Dutch macht, Old High German maht, German Macht, Gothic
          mahts), a Germanic suffixed form of the PIE root *magh- "to be
          able, have power."<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; might (v.) Old English mihte, meahte,
          originally the past tense of may (Old English magen "to be
          able"), thus "*may-ed." The noun might-have-been "something
          that might have happened but did not," also "someone that
          might have been greater but wasn't," is by 1848.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; motion (n.) late 14c., mocioun, "process of
          moving; change of place, continuous variation of position;"
          also "suggestion, proposal or proposition formally made," from
          Old French mocion "movement, motion; change, alteration"
          (13c., Modern French motion) and directly from Latin motionem
          (nominative motio) "a moving, a motion; an emotion," from
          past-participle stem of movere "to move" (from PIE root *meue-
          "to push away").<br>
          From c. 1400 in legal sense of "application to a court or
          judge." To be in motion "in a state of motion" is from c.
          1600; to set in motion "set working" is from 1590s. To go
          through the motions in the figurative sense of "pretend, do in
          a perfunctory manner" is by 1816 from the notion of "simulate
          the motions of." Motion picture is attested from 1896; motion
          sickness by 1942.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rev. G.S. White said : The Presbytery does
          not favour the proposition of the Richmond Convention, and
          thinks the appointment of the Committee unnecessary; yet I
          suppose, that like the man who had nothing to eat, yet always
          spread the table, and sat down, and went through the
          motions—so we, according to our brother, are in honour bound,
          to appoint the Committee and go through the
          motions!—[Laughter] [The Presbyterian Magazine, May, 1858]<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; motion (v.) late 15c., "to request,
          petition" (obsolete), from motion (n.). The sense in
          parliamentary procedure, "to propose, move" is by 1747; with
          meaning "to guide or direct by a significant sign, gesture, or
          movement," as with the hand or head, it is attested from 1787.

        in russian. Did the direction or writing influence the language,
        so if it was more natural at the end of the word we got poop
        loop hoop (butl also poop play pay <br>
        in english there are 57 triliteral words that end with p,&nbsp;
        64 triliteral words that begin with p,<br>
        but when I looked it in dictionary.com, it looked like it was
        only beause dictionaries collect letters by the beginning
        letter, fewer people care of the last, because biliteral
        starting with p were all weird: pa pe pi po pu, I only know
        toponim po and french pas. while -p had up I know and op I only
        guess. So the only biliteral word with p used the most has it on
        it's end, as I predicted. And thus we have to check out those
        triliteral words for frequencies, and to my luck I've already
        made that work:<br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph3english...png"
          alt="" width="4749" height="589"><br>
        and it puts us down with its put, while cap is only second best
        of all with p, and depending on the analyzed text, cup could
        come forward, sometimes ahead both, but put is much more basic,
        it's verb. but then go top, lip, cup, tap, and only then pub,
        pin, paw, per, lap, pro, pan, gap, mop, pot, pay, peg.<br>
        So I think my guess about it was wrong, there are pretty much
        the same ammount of words ending and beginning with p, thus the
        direction of the writing doesn't make much difference for the
        lexics.<br>

        Because that hyph could be half because l works as [j] (й)

        is/not is the question form. and grammar probably only followed
        this pattern by repeatin it without understanding, by similarity
        it was recognized as question, maybe people didn't understand

        הוי is manner, way of life. now you know why hebrew is not

        present is present time.<br>
        <br>
        הו is oh, and that tells that not only pronouns can mirror
        eachother, but other short words too. The order of letters is
        probably exactly the same mechanism as the word order.<br>

        ה for god is probably the same tradition as we have in russian,
        when Он with capital О is the god. Only one он. which is
        naturally so, because он (he) stands for one man and thus he and
        one are some metacognates (cognates uniting all the forms,
        independent of the language) and then H = N, and thus third line
        reflects the second one.<br>

        It is suspicious why do I tell dig here where I live? Because I

        is it o or f? <br>
        f is of if for (from is of room? of roam? of where? of whom? at
        this point who knows)<br>
        of is o<br>
        for is f<br>

        a is a am an at as are (ab, ad, these are latin, why should I
        care of latin. But it is nice to make those diagrams for latin
        texts too) ah all (is all a or o?) aw! (aw is ah, but is awe a
        or o?) <br>
        e is ex (eh is междометие and doesn't matter much. interjection,
        like hm) el en are spanish.<br>
        is yes of y or e? (ew is interjection too)<br>
        not many words with e there is.<br>
        o is of oh all on or off owe awe ox oi <br>
        <br>
        u is only up and that is probably ap, for it sounds ап. ooze
        could be of u. you could be of you.<br>
        u is ум in russian. and these are not some basic words in here.
        So probably A I O are the three first vowels, the ones that got
        many simple words. Now let's look closer at those words:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#cccccc">&nbsp;










          (isn't am of e? then el and en and as are all of e. is e a?
          they look like yin yang fish)</font><br>
        a&nbsp; am are an <font color="#cccccc">(I combine e and a
          here, very unique, but orthography matters in this case)</font><br>

          Because it reflect some)</font><br>
        oh off or on of all awe owe own&nbsp;<font color="#cccccc">
          (dialect maybe. For some reason they used a instead of e)</font><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
          color="#cccccc">(is is probably yes too)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (like can has a and not
          e in the middle in britain)</font><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font

          the orthography)</font><br>

          a dialectal form of the same?)</font><br>
        e am an as at add <font color="#c0c0c0">(en is both in and on
          in spanish, are they all te same vowel?)</font><br>
        i ill if in is it <font color="#cccccc">(I don't include ik and
          ich, because then we have to include all the languages)</font><br>
        o all of off or on oh aum owe awe ox oi ozz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font
          color="#cccccc"> (and it is coming but later, do latin first)</font><br>
        u ooze<br>
        <br>
        Should I listen to orthography in the case of am an as at add
        and not to listen to it in the case of up?<br>
        never heard u read as a? Never heard up read as oop. oops is the
        opposite of ups.<br>
        Who taught brits write up with u? cup with u? is <i>u</i> a
        form of <i>a</i>? neither of them palatalizes, so they could.
        And why a is read as e sometimes? It's read as э. Э doesn't
        palatalize either. Russian Е palatalizes, britting E does not.
        So british E is closer to A and russian Е is closer to I.&nbsp;
        Which is super weird. And what about spanish? Does en unite o
        and i? How is it possible when they're the opposites? It may
        matter for their mentality. en is both on and in on and in are
        en. En is some more common word, not common but universal, more
        field of that word is, on and in specify what n it is, en does
        not.<br>
        in is thin n, on is ball-like n. Иголка В стоге сена. Девочка НА
        шаре.<br>
        <br>
        what is n?<br>
        no now (but now is probably a complex word: no w, not was, is.)<br>
        so am I trying to say that on and in both have some no in there?
        I think I told myself, that in- is no and the semantic
        connection between them is that when the beast is in, it's kind
        of not here. его словно нет.<br>
        <br>
        on? какие-то животные не в норки забираются, а на (на деревья,
        например) <br>
        on is no some object, someone <br>
        in is no some eel, something (but these someone something things
        are mostly poetic, not meaningful)<br>
        <br>
        五 - we spoke about it looking so much as G, but what if I told
        you that it looks like Го.<br>
        can't unsee it, neh? and then it's Fv for five and e and i of
        five is in there. And пТЬ of пять, is it why the chinese forms
        are indirect, but designed to unite all the important languages?<br>
        Where do I see v in 五? I see it's bottom at the right bottom of
        the 五 or maybe I see u, or maybe just fie? пть? i~t again? a
        coincidence I guess.<br>

          least once) as “Archaic punctuation” (see unicode.org )
          although the “five-dot” symbol is listed as equivalent to the
          Greek pentonkion and something called a quincunx.<br>
          <br>
          A quincunx (/ˈkwɪn.kʌŋks/) is a geometric pattern consisting
          of five points arranged in a cross, with four of them forming
          a square or rectangle and a fifth at its center.[1] It forms
          the arrangement of five units in the pattern corresponding to
          the five-spot on six-sided dice, playing cards, and dominoes.
          It is represented in Unicode as U+2059 ⁙ FIVE DOT PUNCTUATION
          or (for the die pattern) U+2684 ⚄ DIE FACE-5. <br>
          <br>
          quincunx /ˈkwɪnkʌŋks/ mid 17th century: from Latin, literally
          ‘five twelfths’, from quinque ‘five’ + uncia ‘twelfth’.<br>

        don't show this to flatearthers, but that is a funky question:
        how does one prove that our earth isn't flat with the space
        metric shrinked or expanded? We see it from the space. And there
        we see that that metric is the metric of the sphere, and that
        will align with spheres in the sky, there we see no angles
        except the rays of the stars. We're not at a star, and those
        rays depend on the optical system we use, thus they're optical
        illusion, either way, that is just an excercise for the brain.
        But if we knew nothing but this map that actually worked, we'd
        have to make some work to do to figure out it, but now I am not
        wasting my time for that, I have to work on letters.<br>

        oh, it's for some long time. And no guarantee that this path
        leads anywhere. <br>
        But, there's only one way to see:<br>
        <br>
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(mathematical_logic)<br>
        <font size="+1">In mathematical logic, a predicate is the
          formalization of the mathematical concept of statement. A
          statement is commonly understood as an assertion that may be
          true or false, depending on the values of the variables that
          occur in it. A predicate is a well-formed formula that can be
          evaluated to true or false in function of the values of the
          variables that occur in it. It can thus be considered as a
          Boolean-valued function.<br>
          A predicate consists of atomic formulas connected with logical
          connectives. An atomic formula is a well-formed formula of
          some mathematical theory. The main logical connectives are
          negation (not or ¬), logical conjunction (and or ∧), logical
          disjunction (or or ∨), existential quantification (∃) and
          universal quantification (∀); the predicates always true
          (denoted true or ⊤) and always false (denoted false or ⊥) are
          commonly considered also as logical connectives.<br>
          A predicate that does not contain any quantifier (∃ or ∀), is
          called a propositional formula. A predicate whose quantifiers
          all apply to individual elements, and not to sets or
          predicates, is called a first-order predicate. </font><br>
        <br>
        The way ⊤ and ⊥ are also T and F reminds me of t and f, and
        inspires me a lot to walk this path:<br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_logic_symbols"><img
            moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/T&amp;F.png" alt=""
            width="1122" height="346" border="0"></a><br>
        <font color="#cccccc">If ⊥ also stands for perpendicular lines,
          is = the parallels? but true isn't just is, but is true, so
          nah..</font><br>
        and just as those greek musical notes had the third form, here
        we also have such form of the T:<br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_logic_symbols"><img
            moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/turnstile.png" alt=""
            width="1125" height="87" border="0"></a><br>
        <font color="#cccccc">and of course there's reversed symbol: ⊣,
          but it's only used in few applications</font><br>
        how old are these signs? The name of this last one is probably
        recent, but then who knows how old is this word and technology,
        it would need nothing but a stick, or at least some tricky stick
        in some tricky hole.<br>
        Anyway, T &amp; F and what is interesting, is that in russian
        and greek these two letters go in this order and they're only
        one U apart. and U is or and it is interesting that they go like
        this. Top Or Bottom. Very interesting. True Ur False.. hm..<br>
        <br>
        If ⊢ is H and that H is И, then ⊢⊥⊤ are ift which is alphabetic
        (or, rather, trimatronic)<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      What am I doing? No, really?! I do have to give up weed and get
      myself in order, so I can build what I must. The June has almost
      passed and I've built nothing this year. It's gross. The fact that
      I invented metalic shell all over it is great, but it's nothing.
      It's not existing anywhere but my mind and even there not exactly
      well. I have to stop smoking weed. Goodbye, everybody. I will
      return when I have something to say. I hope you enjoyed it. Tot
      ziens.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">yet in the morning that ⊢⊥⊤ thing made me
        think of ᛘᛦᛏ MorT is that ᛦ ⋀ or ⋂ crossed by tht l?<br>
        Is ili (или, or) i (и, and) crossed through by לא of l? Is ᛘᛦᛏ
        март (march) or is ᛦᛘᛏ armata, and how is it that both words are
        military? it's still so chaotic. To be continued.<br>
      </font> <br>
      Is meta- вместо? Is meta- anti-? these are questions, not answers.
      ? is for a reason there all the time, unless it's answered right
      beside it. I don't know greek, so why do I care..<br>
      I must meet those university professors, maybe they will carry me
      in.<br>
      Where do I want to get in? <br>

      Восьмеричная система. Если V было четыре, а X было восемь, то ведь
      тогда и алфавитная система была другой: не 3 по 9, но 3 по 7 (и
      именно 3 и 7 являются священными числами, никто толком не знает
      почему, но возможно сейчас приблизимся к разгадке этого)<br>

      well, at least it is interesting. and f reflects t, interesting,
      and m reflects them both, which is very interesting, because some
      runic forms of m are forms for f in other readings and <i>т</i>
      is t in russian.<br>
      n reflects u (but g is hm.. h would be much better here: Н is N in
      russian, and greek Η became И in russian and russian <i>и</i>
      looks just like <i>u</i>)<br>
      e reflects s which is as it goes in some lexics: ecole is school,
      etudant is student, and so on, it's a well-known cognatic
      phenomenon. but what is L? L would better reflect R, but k does,
      and cursive k does look like R, but d, why d? d reflected R in
      k-symmetry. c would reflect k better. and yet it reflects q, that
      third position has j in the second line. And though I like how
      they reflect eachother half of the time, I feel it can make better
      with just a little notch:<br>
      abcdefh (because g is a form of c)<br>
      iklmn<br>
      oprstu (because greek and russian don't know q)<br>
      but now I have some irregularity: first line has 7 letters, and
      second and third - 6 each, let's make it more satanic, using the
      runic canon, where c and d are the same letter (which may explain
      how russian d looks like g: I cannot show that form of д in this
      font, but it looks just like <i>g, there it goes, fifth.</i><br>

      I like how here capital letters reflect eachother torn in half by
      the border between voiced and voiceless parts (К &amp; Р break
      this symmetry I wonder why. And it seems L predate R because of
      that, and because without that Р [R] oпст reflects abcd better,
      and here the symmetry isn't broken, because В [V] is inserted
      between Б [B] &amp; Г [G] and further they go rather symmetric
      (see how φ reminds u to get why уф may reflect её; and further Х
      reflects Ж and Ц reflects З which is super cool, and probably how
      they were, and then Ж used to be voiced h, which is super cool,
      and reflects that ᚼ thing. and then ИЙ reflect ЧШ which is rather
      unexpected, but then that К again (the voiceless among voiced) and
      it make me want to throw the Щ away too, but let's guess they
      balance eachother out. But though then go ЪЫЬ, they're thrown out,
      because russian words don't begin with those letters. And so the
      triad of ЭЮЯ reflect the triad of LMN, which is super cool, but
      not exactly a reflection. But they have 15 letters per a half, and
      alphabet of 15 letters is something legendary. But hardly is it
      this weird thing with БВ, ЕЁ, ИЙ, к.. It is definitely not.<br>

      In english both four and five start with f, and in lating they

      much like german fünf. And that is where I started, actually,
      because if V stands for vier and not fünf, well, I pretty much
      concluded that at least it used to (who knows it which period, in
      some mostly prehistoric period, I guess)&nbsp;&nbsp; <font

          height="20" border="0"></a> you can see some theory of how
      that letter gave birth to two, and though the fact itself is
      probably correct, the theoretic part ther is not what I'm even
      copypasting here. Standing after P is is deffinitely the claster
      similar to БВ and actually reflecting it. And I wonder how could
      that symmetry happen, since greeks don't have БВ and russians
      never had Q or ПФ sequence (jews have ПФ sequence, they consider П
      and Ф the same letter, or rather they diacritize default Ф with a
      dot inside of it. And is it how some ו or ז would never be
      diacritized like that and thus why ב and ד are two different
      letters. or are they? either way that v &amp; z reflect these b
      &amp; d greatly and according to that idea of both voiced and
      voiceless halves splitting into plosive and glides inside of them,
      thus four groups appeared out of two. and that is how... or is it
      how some reformers pushed their alphabets into these structures?
      Nah, more likely they never knew about them, or they would with
      their iron fist arrange their systems according to whatever
      structure they'd choose. And why would you want to make the
      structure, but not to make it perfect? Four types of consonants
      along one line, four types of consonants along the other, but
      speech is always more diverse. What one should do with the other
      letters? To place them into some leap group? Let's try to build
      the structure the way I imagine it and then add those extra
      letters and see how may we make some better job.<br>
      kabbala could be the destructive force, the force that'd destroy
      the previous culture by pulling out letters for their lexical
      plays and adding or removing letters if the play didn't play out,
      and still there's probably no strict system about it (I don't know
      if kabbalah is hogwash or something straight. Hypothetically, they
      could have rework the language itself so it could include some
      words and forget the others, but there's bible probably existing
      before kabbalah, one cannot change the word of god becuase it's
      written down. But one can reinterpret those words.. I doubt they
      did it, they seem to believe. Either way, let's see what we can
      get:<br>
      <br>
      A Б Г Д<br>
      E V Ж З<br>
      И..<br>
      О П К Т<br>
      У Ф Х Ц - russians have preserved this line like this and it may
      say how those Ж and З sound: <br>
      Ж (ᚼ or ᛡ) as ɦ (voiced h) and З as dz. <br>
      <br>
      Then the letters out of this canon would be LMN, R, and I miss
      simple Z and S and it makes me rethink that previous four-liner to
      see that glide form of T is not Ц but S, and that is thus what
      went after Х [h]<br>
      U F H S... let's do it all in latin, fuck russian.<br>

        K)</font><br>

        male and femal forms of the same sign: Queen and King)</font><br>

      can it be that this is some syllabary, remember paleohispanic
      syllabaries, with those exact "extra letters" being
      non-syllabaric, as if they were added to the system being in the
      existence before them?<br>
      мама could be баба in that system. ляля would be дитя..&nbsp; so
      far so good, I will chew on this possibility some more a little
      later.<br>
      <br>
      let's look at those additional letter in the same table from
      vol.6:<br>
      <img moz-do-not-send="true"
        src="12_files/united_paleohispanic_compared%20to%20greek.png"
        alt="" width="1070" height="4086"><br>
      <br>
      Z and S actually added to the syllabary..<br>
      Does it say that Ц is the correct variant, and Z is dz and purer
      forms like s and z appeared later?<br>
      <br>
      The I-line's LMN, then R (probably a variant of R, as it is in
      japanese) and then those Z and S are probably samekh.. and.. J?
      wow.. weird. And that s' in the shape of Ϻ is probably how z was
      mistransliterated (according to celtic iberians and the other
      iberians actually having only two S/Z each, only recognizing them
      differently, or is it academic disagreement. I'm not a specialist
      here, I just do what I can.<br>
      <br>
      Should we now try and arange that syllabary in alphabetic order?
      We may try:<br>

        src="12_files/united_paleohispanic_rearranged.png" alt=""
        width="3223" height="1460"><br>
      And it doesn't bring me much. Not that pattern, that's for sure.
      But what is it? Well, I'm not sure about this greco-iberian,
      unless they recognized M as N and the same letter, it could be
      some sloppy job of the researchers, but I don't claim that until I
      speak that myself.<br>
      But then other iberian (probably researched much better) show me
      that we had additional, extra-syllabaric signs and they could be
      relating to those other groups: MN to B, SZ to D or G, LR to G or
      D.<br>

      Let's rearrange them once more (probably to return to the way they
      were)<br>
      <br>
      <img moz-do-not-send="true"
        src="12_files/united_paleohispanic_rearranged_further.png"
        alt="" width="1081" height="3018"><br>
      <br>
      Looking at western celt-iberian I was wondering: how is it G looks
      like C and C looks like G?<br>
      But then looking at north-eastern iberian, I noticed that they
      don't have a consensus about which forms are voiced and which is
      voiceless, that whether one of the sources was seriously wrong, or
      that didn't even matter and those signs were invariants, just as
      according to these tables only 2 out of 6 iberian syllabaries
      distinguished between voiceless and voiced, and even those two
      didn't distinguish between B and P. <br>
      So I dare to claim, that iberian syllabaries had only three
      consonants in the syllabic part. B C D<br>
      Which allows me to fancy further that idea of alphabets having
      descended from these or some other syllabaries, and because many
      form in here look quite alphabetic: all those k's and C and G <br>
      <br>
      In south-iberian syllabaries we can recognize staveless ᛒ in ba,
      but in others it's just some ᛁ-like form, which is a great way to
      start any system, but I'm confused by it. What lexical reasons
      were there to use for ba what others used for i (or v or n in
      hebrew. or a in arabic. and who knows what where else)<br>
      <br>
      I think it will be much more convenient if I arrange these things
      this other way, and fuck the greko-iberian, it only confuses me
      and tells nothing yet.<br>

      Okay, now let's recognize the letters we know from somewhere else
      from these syllabaries.<br>
      Almost all of them agree that pu is something 𓊩-like (that is
      ancient egyptian for p, and that is a great start) and if it's
      пуф, I don't know, but it probably gave us П.<br>
      du is Δ in all of them. And I think I found another system, which
      uses circle, triangle and rectangle for three mothers, but only
      three of them recognize the circle for a letter, but we needed
      vowel and it is vowel. E P D. or rather ΟΠΔ. and that is how D
      reflects R again. or is it OПТ, that would be more like it, more
      alphabetic. But that is guessing. <br>
      <br>
      Interesting, that that form recognized as B (that staveless ᛒ) in
      one syllabary, is recognized as z or s in the other, and it
      reflects ᛘ and ᛉ, maybe.<br>
      <br>
      Some forms of pi are recognized as some archaic form of p, but
      south-western form uses something ᛏ-like instead, and yet they
      also know that form, but it's not bi, but be; south-eastern uses
      both forms for bi.<br>
      <br>
      Okay, that's it for now, let's see at latin short words from <font
        size="+1">https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Ad_Marciam,_de_Consolatione</font><br>

      only a and e are actual words (the other are numbers) and both a
      and e seem to be the same word, but sometimes there's some slight
      difference between them: they are ec and ex, but also ab and abs.<br>

      This list is incomplete, it only collects all the letters of one
      text, for example he never uses word vir, which is very popular.
      So this strategy is failing and I have to find some better
      algorythm. Some dictionary, maybe. Yeah. all latin triliteral and
      biliteral words, there's such thing on the internet.<br>
      <br>
      Why no words begin with b? Neither in triliteral nor in biliteral.

      Maybe he just didn't use them.&nbsp;

      so to place b or c first was if male or female was more important.
      europeans say ladies first, but here b is male, and c is female,
      which pretty much negates what I said about labials for females
      and linguals fro males. Together with мальчик и девочка, мужчина и
      женщина, бык и корова рисуют совершенно другую реальность. Связано
      это как-то с тем, что -им было женским суффиксом, а -от мужским, а

      Back to the paleohispanic. Some form of di/ti&nbsp; looks exactly
      like pamphylian sampi: <a

      <br>
      Pamphylian greek also has И-like shape for their digamma: Ͷ<font
        color="#999999"> (and it relates to й being close to w)</font><br>
      And it is interesting, not only because и in cursive is <i>и</i>
      which is very similar to <i>u</i> the u ~ v<br>
      but also because it's even more than this:<br>
      <font size="+1"><br>
        Etymology 1<br>
        A glyph development from the Phoenician letter 𐤅‎ (w, “waw”) in
        several epichoric alphabets, wherein Ͷ, ͷ (V, v) denoted the
        archaic phoneme /w/, which was elsewhere denoted by Ϝ, ϝ (W, w,
        “digamma”). In the Pamphylian Greek dialect, /w/ gained the
        allophone [v]; consequently, Ϝ, ϝ (W, w) was adopted to mark the
        distinction (albeit inconsistently), with Ͷ, ͷ (V, v) denoting
        the original [w] and Ϝ, ϝ (W, w) denoting the novel phone [v].<br>
        Pronunciation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pamphylian, hypothesised)
        IPA(key): [w]<br>
        Ͷ • (V) (upper case, lower case ͷ)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pamphylian Greek) digamma, denoting a voiced
        labio-velar approximant, and sorted between epsilon and zeta<br>
        <br>
        Etymology 2<br>
        An alteration of Ϻ, ϻ (Ś, ś, “san”); it occurred in the
        Arcadocypriot Greek dialect of Mantinea in Arcadia, wherein it
        is believed that it denoted a reflex of the Proto-Greek phoneme
        */kʷ/, intermediate between it and the later Arcadocypriot /sː/.<br>
        Pronunciation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Arcadocypriot, hypothesised)
        IPA(key): /t͡sʼ/<br>
        Ͷ • (Ś) (upper case, lower case ͷ)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        (Arcadocypriot) tsan, denoting an alveolar ejective affricate;
        its sorting order is not known<br>
        Synonyms (Arcadocypriot tsan): Σ̱ (S̱)<br>
        <br>
        Etymology 3<br>
        Applied due to the resemblance of the Melian glyph to the
        Unicode reference glyph shared by the Pamphylian digamma and
        Arcadocypriot tsan.<br>
        Ͷ • (B) (upper case, lower case ͷ)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        the isle of Melos</font><br>

      The fact that xv is numeral 15 (and vi is probably 6, just as iv

      is 3, vi is 5, ix is 7, xi is 9 xv 12&nbsp; iv makes more sense as
      3 than as 4, because in christianity god's name is very similar to

      Ask the question again: what does every letter mean? What are the
      words beyond the letters?<br>
      Алфавит это фонетическое письмо, и поскольку нации имеют разные
      языки, они по разному алфавит и переосмысливали: алфавит
      изначально полностью фонетичен: B K T во всех проявлениях.
      Удивительно, что форма креста, использовавшаяся для Т используется
      не для Ту, а для Та, если не Да. крест вроде означает нет, почему
      же да? может потому что палеоиспанский не является русским.<br>

      were these 20 letters like our 20 fingers? That is silly. Who
      would use toes.<br>
      <br>
      It's more like thumbs were used as index at the fingers and only 8
      fingers we knew, octaves could be some ancient word in some other
      meaning. I don't know, I'm guessing, but A to H are the first two
      lines, and musical notation goes A to H (even though only germans
      and russians recognize H as si, all the others onl know A to G, 7
      notes. wtf is H.. how did that thing appeared there? These musical
      theory question have it been answered for me? I think it was, I
      still don't get it.<br>
      <br>
      And because I-line is weird (it was always weird and now those
      sounds<font color="#cccccc"> (except I and K! even though I placed
        K where Q was, well, it's still in the I-line today)</font> are
      not in the syllabic part of paleohispanic and I consider that part
      the most archaic part of all paleohispanics (why would they need
      them if they had alphabetic system. Why do japanese use syllabary?
      Well, do they add alphabetic part to it? what are んン? the wu, this
      consonantal ending is reduced wu. so alphabetic sign come out of
      syllabary, no need to do it the other way around. <br>
      And because whisper are quite intelligable, I say that 8 sounds
      used to be enough. Only two vowels: neutral A and palatalizing E.
      Only 6 syllables, that gave birth to 6 letters:<br>
      A BA GA DA<br>
      E VE YE ZE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye, huh! very smart, and thus
      it repeats the final line's v*yz order. <br>
      And actually this ABGDEVYZ is A to Z. I think I got another
      explanation of why Y is where <font color="#cccccc">i</font>t is
      today. The previous one was the rhombic symmetry around vowels and
      that came almost exactly 8 years ago. It was on a birthday of one
      of my friends, and it's time to check the date, I have to start
      remembering people's birthdays, it's very social. I need to be
      social. I will even cut my hair short and shave my beard away if I
      have no capsule to sleep through the winter. I will justify the
      "readiness" in the winter, I don't seem to believe in myself, I
      think there will be no much to justify. But I must. I must build.
      I really don't want to lose my beard, but this time it will be for
      being not honorable enough to wear it. I must build it. Muses help
      me please. I called fairies farties, I envoke musies again.<br>

      I think I lost my way in trying to figure out how it all was in he
      past, when the most successful people are focusing on the future.
      I must see how it can help me teach people to understand other
      languages faster.<br>
      Either way, let's play with latin some more.<br>
      <br>
      But then, I don't know latin well enough, I would probably not
      recognize words if they actually were combined out of those short
      words. <br>
      <br>
      And what if ab is literally not-in? a- as not and b as in (in
      russian and hebrew, and in dutch binnen uniting both hebrew and
      english forms)<br>
      and about then would be not-in-out? it doesn't make much sense,
      but if further aphexations happened when people forgot what were
      the parts of the words, then it could be, and then meaning would
      deviate much.<br>
      <br>
      If ab is not in (off)<br>
      then ad shoud be not of (not de, and thus whether in or what add?
      attach? at touch? <br>
      ad is literally the opposite of de: <br>
      <br>
      ad<br>
      1 to, up to, towards<br>
      2 near, at until, on, by almost<br>
      3 according to<br>
      4 about with<br>
      <br>
      de is of, and as to is the opposite of of, so is ad is the
      opposite of de<br>
      de ~ of<br>
      ad ~ to<br>
      <br>
      and what is ac? <br>
      <br>
      ăc<br>
      1 (usually before consonants) and, and also, and moreover<br>
      2 (connecting a more emphatic sentence element) and in particular,
      and what is more<br>
      3 (connecting a sentence element which strengthens or corrects the
      first element) and in fact<br>
      4 (in comparisons) than, as<br>
      <br>
      First three meanings of ac make it look like a form of et<br>
      The fourth meaing make it a cognate of as.<br>
      <br>
      ăc could be a- cĕ (not "that's it") <br>
      ci for move! is ce (c'est tout)?<br>
      <br>
      so a is not? and why is it first?<br>
      <br>
      a (not) b(in) c(this) d(of)<br>
      e (ex) f(happen) g...<br>
      <br>
      That is ridiculous, how is it f is for fi and not for fu? What do
      I get? some alphabetic poem of the shortest words? Well, I thought
      some narrative to appear, but it doesn't.<br>
      But I told myself, it's not the right path. Truth is much more
      simple. People didn't make it as a story, they made it the same
      way koreans did: it's a phonetic structure. Maybe syllabaries were
      narrative, but japanese have to rearange them into iroha to get
      pangrams, and "бабу бы" is a great joke, but that's it, others
      don't follow this order, but then daddy do is also quite a
      sequence.<br>
      russian male and english female? it's poetry, it's not the way it
      happened. But let's make this poetry real.<br>
      Let brits take russian women, let russians take english gals.
      Americans seem to be too hard on their male, russian brutal muchos
      will teach those ladies manners. I am for mixture within one race
      but different ethnic groups, the way you had to take a wife from
      another village, to both create the intercultural connections and
      to avoid the imbreeding.<br>
      I saw some clinically retarded child from the marriage of a
      russian and a southerneress. <br>
      And though it's an anecdotal evidence, I would recommend not to
      have children with somebody too different from yourself. Both
      imbreeding and racemixing lead to higher risk of genetic diseases.
      Even though I don't understand the second part, like what wild
      combination can cause genetic diseases if recessive genes are not
      the factor. I also speak as a commoner, as a simpleton, as..
      what's the word.. well, not as a scientist, as a layman.<br>
      <br>
      Let's get back on track of the language.<br>
      <br>
      a b g d<br>
      e v h z (h is voiced, when zain took vulva's place, it made a long
      castling in greek and short castling in the english. then is..
      what? which letter is the king? z? zar! then which is the rook?
      Now I think I see clearly how to play. rook is rogue you
      substitute for a king when the attack is ready.<br>
      but it's just guessing, some artistic expression.<br>
      i m l n (because both l and h turn into и and l~g thing is also
      here)<br>
      o p r t (as a variant, because r reflects l, but it could be q, or
      maybe it couldn't because not everybody have it. It doesn't mean
      those who invented the alphabet didn't. Alphabet would be
      untouched if it was perfect for everybody. There had to be some
      reason to allow people to mutilate it. Sanctity wasn't invented
      then, maybe. Sanctity of it wasn't implemented, because people
      knew people who invented it, so other people of that or higher
      status felt able to modify it.<br>
      у ф х ц<font color="#cccccc"><br>
      </font><font color="#cccccc"><br>
      </font>this prehistoric order is reconstructed on the basis of the
      assumption that voiced-sonor-voiceless was the order of the
      alphabet. It's not for sure, but it seems likely, so I did.<br>
      And because whisper is understood, a to z is the way it was, two
      four-note sequences, octal system. 2 by 4, the way the roman
      numerals go if V is 4. v is 3 in russian alphbet, but it's
      probably nothing. v is number 6 in hebrew, and that could be even
      further from 4 and after it was 5 at some point.<br>
      v could be three if the paleohispanic order it often given by
      academia is not arbitrary, but actually used, then a g b d could
      be the order those syllabaries followed, and though it's similar
      to oriental systems, it could indicate the link between them
      (maybe some pioneer researcher of the field took the idea of
      abecedaries from some eastern one)<br>
      <br>
      a g v d <br>
      it would make more sense if d was two, like duo, du, <br>
      a for az, I<br>
      d for du<br>
      z for they?<br>
      b for вы, U<br>
      <br>
      So was protoalphabet purely phonetic or was it meaningful? <br>
      I think more meaningful variant would win over all the other
      forms, and some contest could be happening then to make alphabet
      out of some principles they knew before it: <br>
      pentatonica ov vowels.<br>
      yin and yang of labial and lingual.<br>
      maybe three elements too. and were vowels one of those elemnts or
      not? LMN are the three letters standing for elements, so they say,
      one of the official etymologies of the word element is el-em-en
      yet from which language the suffix -t is is a mistery. is it
      elemened? eliminate is a funny word, but not semantically
      consistent to this context.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      In situ, I read it and by the context maybe I ecognized on site in
      it. Is it because si and <font color="#cccccc">to </font>tu can
      be united into this word?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      брать правой (carry with right? take.. receive is the word)<br>
      ливать, оставлять, сливать левой (leave with left)<br>
      and both leave and receive end with -ve, and none is neither take
      nor give.. give and leave g-l thing again (I don't explain what
      thing it is, if you read it you should know, okay, &lt;&nbsp; and
      ^, ג and λ, etc.<br>
      <br>
      правый бравый<br>
      <br>
      right bright<br>
      <br>
      давать левой (<i>g</i> unites g and d, I explained why. and g
      &amp; l are also united, so l ~ d as glagolica also tells that
      they're similar)<br>
      <br>
      да и ле тогда почему такие? ле ближе к не и к ло одновременно. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      if e is ex, then external is eternal? and internal is only
      interim? there was some better word with in, but maybe it was im
      then non of non permanent, some impermanent, but shorter and
      brighter, what's the word.. but I find immanent instead, which
      crosses this guess out.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      after sending some raw letter, I say to myself<br>
      See, you was too hard (and both heart and hot was in that hard)<br>
      if hard is heart and heart is heared, then hard is I can hear you.
      Now stop crying, I'm working. But don't waste your time by sending
      letter too soon, you would make it better if you waited for two
      hours, for four hours, I said a week. Pretend you have a lot of
      things to do. It will also helpyou with some editing ideas. Some
      snot should be wiped out, so lame, so lazy. No discipline.<br>
      <br>
      Discipline kills creativity. I would be still obsessed with that
      letter for hours, I want to go on. If I'm sorry I sent it faster
      than I thought, I would learn not to do what exactly in the
      letters? To do, to wipe out all the<font color="#cccccc"> snot.

      <font size="+1">Demokrits Sphaera. Mittel zur Prognose für Leben
        und Tod. Bring in Kenntnis, auf welchen Mondtag (der Leidende)
        erkrankte, und addiere die Tage zum Zahlenwert seines Namens und

      Lol, what a bunch of crap, is it true? did they believe it? But
      let's not laugh at them: at least they gave more than a half
      probability for the client living.&nbsp; and now I wonder is this
      40% where the association with 4 as with death comes from? Not
      just she for both words, but is that 4 that she brits know? 4 ends
      and men have 5 of them. Head is not the end, it's the beginning,
      rosh, bereshit. поставить во главу угла,&nbsp; глава is only
      chapter in english, but in hebrew head and beginning is the same
      word.<br>
      so is it 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.. and what I was doing here is seing
      0 two times in the 8 and in 9 one of those 0s became 1. then ten
      would look like 2 underneathe only if it was turned 90°. <br>
      <br>
      And scrolling that undecyphered pdf I found that that Vasiliev bro
      didn't imagine things, but actually made some translation, as he
      actually claims:<br>

      To call it quits is to call it конец and that is where v and ν

      but then what is the translation of quit? канай ат<font

      it's nothing.<br>

      as if dead is dead-dead and mad is mind-dead, and deaf is dead f
      and hten f is for ear. which is hm.. feelings maybe for f. h~f

      and ear hear tells that e plays here too, and g as ж tells that s
      the ш is this very g, especially because they look so much alike.
      And s does reflect c which does reflect g. so thus pqr are f~g
      spectre, p reflects f, no question about it, q reflects g and c
      and k, no doubt about it too. r is what? r i г.<br>
      so all qrs were of c and b transposed into p and d into t, but
      then why are there so many c's? no, not that, I wasnted to say why
      not into q, graphic part tells that d could be q, AND t at the
      same time, and c is the letter of the later period, of the period
      where some linguals were giving ...forgot the though when went to
      watch why we write чего when we clearly say чиво. When did it
      happen and which direction did it happen? Was it mistake or a
      trick of some orthographers, or was Г the way russian pronounced
      what they pronounce as V today? <br>
      ΓΛV as three forms of the same letter? And that is how 7 letters
      became 21? And aleph they probably added after that (aleph or
      somebody else, or I'm tripping and it will show in the future,
      we'll see. Believe in me I tell to myself: and I Look at ΓΛV and
      wonder why greeks don't have V, but only Y instead? it's
      suspicious.&nbsp; And Δ reminds Λ here and in glagolitic, adn d l
      are similar too. is d cl? could be, it is similar to something
      between c and l, but then it means that d appeared as this
      ligature and only after Γand Λ got distinguished as two separate
      letters. THus once again its not abd, but abc, or rather c and d
      were one form of the same: staveless and stavved, untl peoople
      forgot the basics of staff and were writing sigs in lines and c
      adn d were just forms of the same letter as <i>g</i> and <i>д</i>
      in russian (forms of these, not the unicode function of these
      letters, though <i>д</i> is the letter I'm speaking about, <i>g</i>
      is just a convenience to use its form, and because these forms
      совпадают, we can say that c g d are all the same letter. in the
      past. With this work I look into the past. Maybe this disbalance
      allows me to look into the future too.<br>
      both <i>g</i> and <i>д</i> are staved forms of c, so abc is the
      simplest forms. and if c is the crescent, then b is staved
      crescent too. Staved as a female holds the stick just in case, and
      to be more different form c, for convenience of distinguishing
      between those scratches. b is closed and c is open (were men less
      attracted to dresses?)<br>
      and if this is the moon phases, where b is ɔ (both o and b are
      labial, so ɔ is a staveless form of b) and if we remove the
      absurdity of a, we have the most basic yin yang alphabet of ɔc.
      &gt;&lt;. more or less. <br>
      mO: lE:ss&nbsp; how convenient that what stands for ɔ is all
      labial and what stands for c is all lingual.<br>
      <br>
      I was thinking of ΒΓΔ reflecting that VΓΛ thing, but then I notice
      this pattern:<br>
      ΑΒΓ ΔΕΖ ΗΘΙ Κ ΛΜΝ ΞΟΠ ΡΣΤ ΥΦΧ ΨΩ<br>
      But then I see, that even thoug O is labial as B, ɔ as b; and that
      П looks like Г and Г is transliterated into H sometimes, and H
      relates to П in japanese and probably somewhere else, I will sort
      these drafts out some day, and will see what is where.<br>
      Well, even then I still see ОПР (i'm sorry, ai readers, that I use
      russian instead of greek, I think I warned you that this
      convention may happen, consider them typoes) more consistent as
      ABГ (and now even latin, sumimasen)<br>
      <br>
      ΑΒΓ ΔΕΖ ΗΘΙ Κ ΛΜΝ ΞΟΠ ΡΣΤ ΥΦΧ ΨΩ<br>
      <br>
      Ξ in ΞΟΠ makes not relation to A, only that Ξ is X and a is Ⰰ in
      glagolythic, (it has much shorter sleeves sometimes) either way
      it's quite a long pull.<br>
      It's shocking, that I can pull ΡΣΤ and ΥΦΧ&nbsp; to that ABГ, and
      though ΥΦΧ lays into that pattern of vowel-labial-lingual, how can
      ΡΣΤ go there? P (that's R) is vowel in india and croatia, Σ looks
      like staveless B, and then г ~ в in чего and чево, but in the
      light of the previous I scream "nonsense! nonsense!" Τ makes great
      Г, both graphically and phonetically, both look like forms of one
      another, maybe T is double Г, who knows, I'm not there yet.<br>
      <br>
      ΨΩ demand that Κ and Os Ps Ks could relate to that weird ΞΟΠ,
      explaining that that's our triad, <br>
      that ΞΟΠ reflects ΚΩΨ sequence, and maybe that for whatever reason
      ΞΟΠ go in the wrong order and should be ΟΠΞ like OPQ. And it
      demands the latin broken into these triads:<br>
      ABC DEF GHIJ K LMN OPQ RST UVW XYZ<br>
      first let's explain the previous part:<br>
      ΑΒΓ ΔΕΖ ΗΘΙ Κ ΛΜΝ<br>
      Δ like Α<br>
      Ε like Β (graphically mostly, and somewhat semantically too: exist
      is to be.<br>
      So three sides a letter has: graphic, phonetic, and now semantic?
      Semantic could be the third element of the letters, the third, or
      first or second, mother.<br>
      ΓΖ ΗΘΙ Κ ΛΜΝ<br>
      <br>
      ΓΛV is KLM but this destroys the cardhuse I placed before this
      place. <br>
      <br>
      I think I got diverted by some false path I tried to ponder on
      before. Yes, letters are triads, but they're split all across the
      alphabet like actual forms of Г Λ V are not only in different
      places of the alphbaet, but also in different alphabets (greek г
      is γ and that is surprise actually, I thout it was ζ or ξ so
      "well" do I know greek alphabet. either way, that γ weirdly
      reflects that V is Y in greek. and let's see how far apart are
      them)<br>
      ΑΒ<font color="#ff6600">Γ</font>ΔΕΖΗΘΙΚ<font color="#ff6600">Λ</font>ΜΝΞΟΠΡΣΤ<font
        color="#ff6600">Υ</font>ΦΧΨΩ<br>
      one interval is 7 the other is 8, and if we remove that
      non-universal Ξ, we maybe get ourselves 7 in the second interval,
      but then V in english is not Y but Φ (a little different from
      russian Ф, but only by shades around it, they're in differen light
      sources and in different shades, this is a field to research per
      se, but I try to come back to what was interesting today)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      ɔc. &gt;&lt;. more or less. <br>
      mO: lE:ss&nbsp; how convenient that what stands for ɔ is all
      labial and what stands for c is all lingual.<br>
      <br>
      This thing gets the first prize today. Let's look into it some
      more.<br>
      ɔ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c d a<br>
      c(e) &nbsp;&nbsp; ɔ(f)&nbsp;&nbsp; c(g)&nbsp; ɔ(h)<br>
      c(i, j, k, l)&nbsp; ɔ(m) c(n)<br>
      or are j ɔ and l reflects it around k? I think I'm tripping away
      again.<br>
      <br>
      ɔ for labials<br>
      c for linguals, that's it. please leave it here. but I have to dig
      further to whether a breakthrough or the decay, both are valid
      because both will be truth speaking in its ways.<br>
      <br>
      ɔ o c<br>
      is the picture of three phases (three faces) and it mays <font
        color="#cccccc">s</font>ound as бог (god)<br>
      and that pair of бог (bog) and god (гад) may lay in the heart of
      why we write чиво as чего.<br>
      <br>
      го как замена бо. словно они боролись с тем, что мы называем бога
      богом, и хотели чтоб мы называли его го-дь. для универсализации,
      для смягчения межнционального напряжения порождённого взаимной
      неприязнью вызванной взанимным непониманием (наши слова почитания
      кажутся соседям проклятиями, как асура и ашура, но даже на
      каком-то ещё более глубоком уровне, в том древнем уровне, когда
      порождался алфавит, и я подозреваю, что это больше трёх
      тысячелетий назад. <br>

      <br>
      there's some english translation of this thing, search for The
      Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, Including the Demotic Spells
      at lib gen, I don't mirror it today, especially because I only
      found the first volume:<br>

      <br>
      I'm confused by this magic thing, but I metioned it in words of
      Demetrius in vol.1. <br>
      My duty is to develop all the topics I raise. I wonder where it
      leaves me, but let's try to pray this way.<br>
      <br>
      I'm not pronouncing those prayers because I didn't understand the
      context. Let's place vol.1 of that english verion here. Okay that
      image above is clickable I will only be able to read it in
      english, so until I finish reading, I whether know german or greek
      or the english edition of vol.2 appears.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Валенки валены ки ьi<br>
      k = ь, swash could lay like this. Look at the coursive and see how
      k can be ь in its forms: stick first, the lower right stroke is a
      swash of ᚴ, and because K is swashed, ᚴ is more clear, pure, and
      thus runes were secret exactly until some brownies began using
      text. Priests fucked themselves. Religion failed us.<br>
      Rome fell when heathens began fighting christina brothers. Ne mir
      ya vam prinyos no mech, he said.<br>
      Can we jar the worms in their Judea which won indipendence from
      Rome. <br>
      Rome has to admit defeat. Jews should fuck off and celebrate
      victory and freedom. <br>
      What if freedom for them is to live like their book teaches: to
      parasite! Who cares how many books exist, why do I demand from all
      the jews to repent for sins of some believers? I know where they
      gather, I may go talk to them if I feel it right, but believers
      are crazies or to control the crazies, why would I go there?
      Because I had visions? I took psychedelics, so it's no wonder. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Валенки валеные <br>
      алёнка алёна <br>
      пелена пелена (пЕлена глагол? спеленали, например, слышал. пЕлена
      пеленая, а значит не глагол, но причастие. на причастия
      распространяется орфография глагола (не отдельно, ещё предстоит
      понять почему) <br>
      вАлена что пЕлена, такое же причастие. причастие это почти часть
      речи как диалект почти язык. с боку припёко, припёко припёка
      диалектные варианты. коробочка коробочко, хотя первое нетипичное и
      литературное, в общем снова полетело не туда. <br>
      <br>
      I must force myself to thing to think into the furthre future =
      further = farther =&gt; far is fur is fir?<br>
      мех is мах? живое? мех is мощь was my first association I didn't
      type it because it seems arbitrary, weak, no good. <br>
      Не мех но шкура? замша? кожа? кожа хороша? кожа одёжа, кожа рожа,
      кожа похожа, рожа похожа? ржа пхжа? R = Ph? wow. sind.. binden
      rune. R = Ф? I said ᚱ = П.<br>
      ᚮᚱᛦ<font color="#cccccc">(if R, or ᛣ if Q)</font>ᛋᛏᚢ<br>
      if ph is pЬ, где Ь не b, но мяхкий знах.<font color="#cccccc">
        znak. zna-key. </font><br>
      R = Ph = F Fr what a surprise, and one letter closer to fart i
      perdett, dett is deyatt, to do. I know what deyatt means but
      mostly because of these suffixes.<br>
      <br>
      ᛋᛏᚢ is beautiful as stave.<br>
      How comes I never knew word stave, but only staff was known to me,
      and I knew that plural staff is staves. Staff is some other word
      today, how could I knew that staff stave before stave staff?<br>
      Staff as personal is the magic wand? magic ward. magic word. ward
      ~ pupil, ward is another word I mostly didn't know. Does this
      language unwind before me better than before any englishman
      because I discover it in older head. подопечный и опекаемый. оба
      слова от слова опека. т.е. это вообще практически что? когнаты
      значит? тем более если подопечный переводится и как pupil. and
      those are the only two adjectives in russian to translate ward
      with. the only verb is ohranyatt, to guard. <br>
      nouns are plenty: ward the chamber (палата, камера, заключение),
      ward the custody(guardianship) then ward the district, ward the
      guard, and ward as some groove up or down (many words in these
      words I don't know: projection, ledge, protrusion, lip, lug, and
      recess, notch, groove, excavation, hollow<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      if ᛋᛏᚢ is stave, what do I see in the other line? ᛆᛒᚦᚾᚠᚵᚼ<font
        color="#cccccc">(or ᛡ)</font>ᛁᚴᛚᛘ<font color="#cccccc">(even
        though it looks like ᛉ)</font>ᚿᚮᚱᛦ<font color="#cccccc">(if R,
        or ᛣ if Q)</font>ᛋᛏᚢ<br>
      could ᚮᚱᛣ be oRk? oPhk? could Tolkien use runkes ork staves
      because they are? He had to invent writing systems of other
      nations of those mythical times, but runes existed even them. Did
      they make it so that anybody telling that it's so would be blamed
      to be reading too much Tolkien? tricky. tricky tricky.<br>
      <br>
      ork stv is what I clame to be in the last die.<br>
      v is their labial, so ᚱ can be R as we know it and then ᛣ is the
      q. The queen you cannot you know what, the mother of the nation,
      wife of everybody so whole the country should love her. That could
      be natural solution for the most beautiful woman. Virgin queen
      could be the nun people would обожали вплоть до обожествления.
      обожжёный горшок обожжён? оббожёный. обнажённый. обнажённой
      обожемой обожаемой. <br>
      о and ы make so much sense now as o and i.<br>
      . в i залупа?<br>
      my dick gets harder just thinking of o now.<br>
      o'coolnickoff.<br>
      okoolnickoff. double o tells the stress, but ' for the stress is
      much better, especially because kool is too negro. o'colniko to
      salute the ukreign. rusa is r'usa right wing of the usa? left wing
      is the france, I suppose. france and russia love eachother I never
      knew why, voyna i mir, boulevar sebasopol, revolutions, etc.<br>
      <br>
      ork stave, what else?<br>
      ᛆᛒᚦᚾᚠᚵᚼ<font color="#cccccc">(or ᛡ)</font>ᛁᚴᛚᛘ<font
        color="#cccccc">(even though it looks like ᛉ)</font>ᚿ<br>
      lmn element o lemon. lemon, but I know of samekh (probably some
      dialectal suffix) and recognize ᛚᛘᚿ as elements. samekh is ц? I
      don't know, I'm mostly guessing, гадаю, дивинаю.<br>
      ᚼᛁᚴ [jik] or [hik] or джик? йик может быть йогом? яик? ik?
      загадочно слово<br>
      ᛆᛒᚦ could be обязуюсь, ابد used to be translated by g-thing as
      forever, now as never, but among examples only life and perpetuate
      can be translated as ابد. so it makes me go hm.. أبد is translated
      as forever, I was wrong just a minute before, but I still don't
      really know difference between أ and ا.<br>
      ᚾᚠᚵ is completely unclean. efg is nice EFГ but what does it mean?
      And was F removed all the time because other dice had one labial
      per die and the first one had both B and V or F (even in russian
      it has two labials, but they don't count one of them and they even
      say that.. and I feel like I got into some other timeline, where
      they see fita in glagolitic as numberless, some ж и з stand where
      I would expect to meet fita. Did I see it in russian glagolitic
      and now I google in english and receive croatian?<br>
      <br>
      here I googled in russian and still got fita neither 8 nor 9, but
      what is 9 looks suspiciously similar to fita, why do they have not
      2 ж и з but 3 of such sounds in that locus? Could it be that it
      was transliterated by someone from strong european tradition to

      and now see croatian thing for a contrast:<br>
      and I decided not to take images I used before, and I found
      something reminding me that previous timeline I was in, where
      glagolitic fita was not 9, but 8 and was removed to the end of the
      alphabet, but in this one it is simply thrown away:<br>
      <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/tablica_gl_bp800.jpg"
        alt="" width="800" height="517"><br>
      didn't I use this image before? I think I had it. Either way,
      let's collect some more:<br>
      <img moz-do-not-send="true"
        src="12_files/6ffa71672433f5d0f0eb23333d0c1daf.jpg" alt=""
        width="825" height="583"><br>
      Here you can see how it is different from the one in russian, this
      one have somewhat different forms and numerology of it is a little
      different: there fita was 400 an fert was numberless, and here 400
      is fert and fita is nowhere to be seen. But then again it has
      three forms of z-zh-z thing. Which is super weird and I will
      return to this peculiarity of glagolitic scripts later.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile look at the level of academic linguistics:<br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">Old Church Slavonic manuscripts are written in two
        alphabets: Glagolitic or Cyrillic. Scholars debate as to which
        of the two alphabets was designed by St. Cyril (827-869 CE). The
        name “Cyrillic” suggests that it was invented by St. Cyril, but
        most researchers now believe that Glagolitic was the alphabet
        devised by St. Cyril, perhaps with the help of his brother
        Methodius, for the purposes of their early missionary work. The
        main argument for this claim comes from the fact that of the
        surviving OCS manuscripts, the oldest are written in Glagolitic.
        (The corpus of surviving OCS manuscripts is discussed in the
        following post.)</font><br>
      <br>
      And why don't they think that slavic peoples had writing system
      before Cyril? Especially since they themselves wrote.. nope, not
      themslevels, some Черноризец Храбр<font size="+1">: Прѣжде ѹбо
        словѣне не имѣхѫ писменъ. нѫ чрътами и рѣзами чьтѣхѫ и гатаахѫ
        погани сѫще. кръстивше же сѧ. римьсками и гръчьскыми писмены.

      In this image only a half of this story, it ends on the canon
      cyril gave to it, and there probably more interesting of that, and
      it's still hard for me to read these texts, either way, whole the
      book is at the end of the pdf that image leads to.<br>
      <br>
      So that современник (this is a copy, the first printed copy of
      16th century, there are earlier copies, but only from some
      centuries earlier, not a single copy of that book from that
      ancient time is known today, and it is complicated, because there
      could be more to their idea that glagolitic was invented by
      cyrill, even though it's retarded, because then why call him the
      father of russian writing system, and the text above explicitly
      tells that he literally took greek alphabet and only added some
      letters to it (the same way the made later for tatarian and other
      soviet languages) but the dogma demands that slavs had no writing
      system before christians, thus such mental gymnastics is
      performed:<br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">Еще в середине&nbsp; XIX&nbsp;
        в.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; А. В. Горским, И. И. Срезневским, П. И.
        Шафариком и другими славистами было высказано предположение о
        том, что первоначальный вариант «Сказания о письменах» имел в
        своей основе глаголический текст. Предпринятые в&nbsp;&nbsp;
        XX&nbsp;&nbsp; в. исследования состава глаголического алфавита в
        связи с анализом азбучных акростихов и древнейших славянских
        абецедариев подтвердили это предположение.&nbsp; </font><br>
      <br>
      I wonder how would they "подтвердили это предположение" let's
      leave this end loose for now, I will return to this subject, but
      not today, it's time to go to bed or something. that text where I
      copy-pasted it doesn't seem to give the explanation to its claim.<br>

      Let her counter-balance my stance and I leave it for you to decide
      whose reasoning stands.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, some interesting pieces from that text translated into
      modern russian:<br>
      <font size="+1">Одни говорят: “Почему тридцать восемь букв создал,
        ведь можно и меньшим числом их писать, как греки двадцатью
        четырьмя пишут”. И не ведают, сколькими пишут греки, ибо хотя
        есть двадцать четыре буквы, но не наполняются лишь ими книги, но
        прибавлено двугласных одиннадцать, и в числах еще три: (шесть),
        (девяносто) и (девятьсот), и собирается их тридцать восемь.<br>
        Так же, по тому подобию и образу, сотворил святой Кирилл
        тридцать восемь букв.<br>
        ....<br>
        Ибо Бог не сотворил сначала ни еврейского языка, ни римского, ни
        эллинского, но сирийский, им ведь Адам говорил, и от Адама до
        потопа говорили, и от потопа, пока Бог не разделил языки при
        столпотворении, как писано. Когда же смешались языки, и как
        смешались народы, так и нравы и обычаи, и уставы и законы, и
        искусства по народам: египтянам — землемерие, персам и халдеям,
        и ассирийцам — звездочетие, волхвование, врачевание, чарование и
        все искусства человеческие; иудеям же — святые книги, в которых
        писано, как Бог создал небо и землю, и все, что на ней, и
        человека, и все по порядку, как писано; эллинам — грамматику,
        риторику, философию. Но изначала эллины не имели для своего
        языка букв, а финикийскими буквами писали свою речь, и так было
        долгие годы. Палимед же после пришел. Начав с альфы и виты,
        шестнадцать букв только эллинам обрел. Прибавил к ним Кадм из
        Милета буквы три. Так много лет девятнадцатью буквами писали. И
        потом Симонид обрел и прибавил две буквы, Эпихарий же,
        толкователь, три буквы обрел, и собралось их двадцать четыре. А
        через много лет Дионисий Грамматик шесть двугласных обрел, потом
        другой пять, и другой три численных. И так многие за много лет
        едва собрали тридцать восемь букв<br>
        ....<br>
        Тем же славянским письменам более святости и чести, что святой
        муж сотворил их, а греческие - эллины поганые. <br>
        Если же кто скажет, что не устроил их добро, потому что
        доделывают их еще, в ответ скажем этим: и греческие также
        многажды доделывали - Акилла и Симмах, и после иные многие.<br>
        ....<br>
        Вот если спросить книгочеев греческих так: кто вам письмена
        сотворил или книги перевел, или в какое время, - то редкие из
        них знают. Если же спросить славянских грамотеев так: кто вам
        письмена сотворил или книги перевел, то все знают и, отвечая,
        говорят: святой Константин Философ, нареченный Кириллом - он нам
        письмена сотворил и книги перевел,и Мефодий, брат его.<br>
        И если спросить, в какое время, то знают и говорят, что во время
        Михаила, царя греческого, и Бориса, царя болгарского,и
        Ростислава, князя моравского, и Коцела, князя блатенского, в
        лето от сотворения всего мира 6363-е.<br>
        Есть же и иные ответы, их же в ином месте скажем, а ныне не
        время.<br>
      </font><br>
      Anyway, here's a previous edition of the text, a century or two
      centuries priot ot that printed version shown before.<br>

          width="3024" height="2016" border="0"></a><br>
      Notice, that here it doesn't say that they read with those signs
      (like it does in the previous, or rather chronologically later,
      edition) the same way Tacitus only tells that germans were only
      divinating with their signs. But both variants of Hrabr's tale are
      copies, so who knows how it was in his original text. Hardly would
      christians added the piece about them reading with their pagan
      writings, but that they could be motivated to exclude it, this I
      believe. anyway, let's bring it in its pletora this time:<br>

      some other hand-written edition mentions them reading with those
      writings:<br>

        width="1364" height="800"><br>
      but probably this is the text Fyodorov took for his azbuka, so
      what does it prove? I need more manuscripts. Either way, signs are
      for reading, whether in divinations you read, if you divinate with
      signs, that's text. But then again, I'm biased.<br>
      <br>
      It is weird how glagolitic origin of this text is the established
      dogma today, even though not a single of those 79 copies is in
      glagolitic. I believe that's a conspiracy to prove that slavs had
      not writings before christianos:<br>
      <font size="+1">The manuscript of On the Letters has been
        preserved in 79 copies in seven families of texts, including
        five contaminated manuscripts, plus four abridgements
        independent of the seven families.[3] All of these families
        probably ultimately share a common protograph.[3] Not one of the
        textual families contains an optimal text, and none of them can
        be established to be the source of any other.[3] None of the
        text families can be shown to have dialectal features, albeit
        some of the individual manuscripts in the families do have
        them.[3] The protograph was written in Glagolitic, and it
        underwent significant change or corruption in the course of its
        successive transcription into seven families of Cyrillic
        texts.[3] Today only Cyrillic manuscripts survive.[3] The
        hyparchetypes of all seven families give the number of the
        letters in the alphabet as 38, but the original Glagolitic
        alphabet had only 36, as attested in the acrostic of Constantine
        of Preslav; however, one of the abridgements instead gives the
        number as 37 and another gives it as 42.[3]</font><br>

      same, otherwise why would it be whatever.. let's try it.<br>

      так давай случайным образом сдвиним рамку ещё на одну букву чтоб

      другим законам? эти э и з мелочь подобная e and q in k-symmetry,
      e/q and o/g there are, still unexplained, and in the same ammount,

      nah, this part is only 1/3 good, that's no good, and that's not
      the same way, ау-symmetry doesn't go as k-symmetry goes, н о п р с
      т go where the у-part has no letters left. <br>
      <br>
      И что всё это значит? Что&nbsp; я принимаю 20% несоответствия и
      принимаю k-symmetry as a law?<br>
      Nothing have grown out of the k-symmetry, and thus that's time to
      reject it.<br>
      But then again vowel-labial-lingual has the same 20% of exception
      in M, should we discard that too?<br>
      Or should it play as a proof that 20% is how much mutilated the
      alphbaet is in all spheres, merely by statistical probabilistical
      mutation rate telling of the time when the alphabet was invented
      or introduced, which is yet to be figured out by this mutation

      was there five letters in each of four aicme? a b g ? d to reflect
      o p q rs t&nbsp; - was that ? l to reflect r? but then is s of c
      or of t?<br>
      Or were they using 4-literal, 4-numeral, were they using 4-base
      thing? or should I say 10-base numeral system where we know 10 as
      5? thus 0 1 2 3 4 would be their set.<br>
      a b c d&nbsp; and&nbsp; e f g h&nbsp; as the fingers thing, where

      was the second half of the alphabet tent to have more than 4
      letters, becaus all five digits of the toes seem to be in play.
      were there 6 instead of 5 because the tradition to add in thumbs
      came along with the tradition to count toes?<br>

      voiced should be the thumbs. <br>
      R is one of them, that's for sure.<br>
      But is V or Z (or Y, or W!) the other thumb?<br>
      у ф х ц ч ш щ <br>
      russian form of that line doesn't help it either, because it has
      no voiced letters at all. except у<br>
      yet because of that у (looking just like y, but she's u) and
      because the way it goes on: ъыьэюя I consider Y to be the thumb.
      but z would reflect the r better and uvwy would be better together
      for they are фшч in a sense. and what is the second thumb? what
      balongs among Ee Vv Ɦɦ Zz? Y would look great between x and z
      of&nbsp; Ɦɦ and Zz. And then those thumbs were held as a fig? And
      whether z is index finger or that fig is non-standard? but I
      didn't see such figs among deaf signs, and z is great for index:
      this, zie, sie, and isn't that sie the final z in that final toe?

      Listening to HORRORTHON by Secret Chiefs 3 <br>
      I noticed myself splitting it into instruments, but then I
      realized that I used to listen to the music differently, as the
      one flow of sound, and I allowed it to let go and merge into one
      and it sounds now so much better!<br>
      <br>
      (it was another offtopic chapter, but I hope you enjoy it, even
      though I know how to label it. Is it music theory? It is music
      practice)<br>

      And i we keep that НнОоПпРрСсТт line instead of those weird АаВвГг
      we get КкЛлМм which is a suppoer cool symmetry. L for Г, M for B,
      A for K (a used to look like k in phonician: 𐤀 and brahmi: 𑀅)<br>
      it is like K reversed (phoenicians wrote the <font
        color="#cccccc">otehr</font> other way around)<br>
      <font color="#990000">And then I notice that it aligns so well,
        because I took the liberty to change the order (КМЛ instead of
        КЛМ, and I noticed it not before I went on comparing the
        versions of the Hrabr's tale, so who konws how many mistakes
        like this there are above, probably not for all of them I
        suddenly retturned for no reason, or to make rings above them as
        I promise to do. Liberty given, liberty taken and taken further
        over the limit and as a result it became absurd. What am I doing
        here? It's a righteous question.</font><br>
      So before alphabet went<font color="#cccccc"> pats </font>past T,
      the symmetry was not a-half to o-half, but a-half to k-half.<br>
      a b c d e f g h i j<br>
      k l m n o p q r s t<br>
      and they're literally halves. 10s. probably they were 9s before j
      and q were added. let's try it:<br>
      a b c d e f g h z (h voiced, english r reminds voiceless h, maybe
      they copied latin pronounciation)<br>
      l m n s o p q r s hm.. something like this.<font color="#990000">
        (these three lines I added after that remark)</font><br>
      and only when v appears past t, we get the k-symmetry. and that
      could preexist, because somehow they would be mirrored? Let's see:<br>
      abcdefghij<br>
      E~F<br>
      <i>d~g</i><br>
      c~h<br>
      b~i (the same hardly explicable i~m repeats in the k-sym and I
      explain it semantically, but do I use semantic in other cases? B
      &amp; T, d &amp; R, e &amp; q are mirrored graphically, though
      poorly, f &amp; p are phonetic similarity. gq are phonetic too,
      but different, see, letters can go any way, yet they are ..<br>
      a b c d e f g h i j<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; k<br>
      u t s r q p o n m l<br>
      g and o - hardly any direct similarity, but semantically globus of
      g and sphere of o, G may be the closest to G (after Q. but then
      isn't <i>q</i> secretly <i>g</i>?)<br>
      <br>
      These "symmetries" are the weakest of the first three. Is it the
      freshest, the finest, the latest attempt to have symmetry there?
      only linear sticked and yet nowhere it is perfect now (M gave
      birth to l and n and went off the scene, leaving it fro K of the
      King or J of the Jupiter, SaintFather? Ju is Jo is Io is yhwh? их
      бох. их в-х их вах их верх их великах, их величество или что-то
      типа того, но это глюки, не значит чо они не истины, но глюки. <br>

      as you can see, more archaic version (at the left) forgets about
      spacebars sometimes, and then suddenly uses dots to separate
      words, but those dots are some forgotten comma-like punctuation
      marks: they used spacebars for the commas earlier in the text:
      longlongsetofwords, and then, suddenly, commas.<br>
      And that is not the only reason I find it much easier to read more
      newer text (at the right) though it's literally the first printed
      font in russian. so it's also rather old, and though are not that
      much different grammatically, they're the borderline between what
      I consider myself unable to read and what I can read rather well.
      <font color="#cccccc">So I can practice reading that book some
        more and I will be able to read much more of russian antiquity.</font><br>
