      word is во рту<br>
      rot is red (rot is mouth in russian, and probably because it is
      red)<br>
      rot in english is red because of inflammation.<br>
      is it? How dare I mix this all up before the results from the
      program comparing words from the monoliteral up are ready? <br>

      Here something relating to the rotations I discuss since vol. 1<br>
      <br>
      <img src="12_files/child_Roland.jpg" alt="" width="1785"
        height="1056"><br>
      <font size="+1">"Fair Burd Helen," said the Magician, "must have
        been carried off with her shadow by the fairies when she was
        running round the church widershins; for fairies have power when
        folk go against the light. She will now be in the Dark Tower of
        the King of Elfland, and none but the boldest knight in
        Christendom will be able to bring her back."</font><br>
      <font color="#cccccc">I wonder why it's not easy to find the
        poetic version of the whole fairy-tale, but that's the way it is
        in the Joseph Jacobs's collection:
        https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7439/7439-h/7439-h.htm</font><br>
      <br>
      and as I promised in the very finale of vol.1 I did go to jews and
      when I discussed with them the way I circle round the field to
      find more and more, I noticed that my hand went "widershins", the
      counter-clockwise. And this word tells that counter-clockwise is
      the direction outside. And by that road clock-wise will be into
      the church, so in this way крёстный ход перед входом в церковь
      должен быть по солнцу, а выходить из церкви против солнца? Я
      уверен, в церковной литературе лежит весь ход религиозной мысли по
      причине которого пришли к сегодняшней традиции водить хороводы
      отворотные.<br>
      231 gates tell that one direction is delight while the opposite is
      plague. <br>
      And plague was in the past, so when I showed the "deeper and
      deeper" thing, I probably went into the past with my thought. And
      indeed, counter-clockwise goes to the left at it's top and they
      say our timeline is left to right (at least for those who read and
      write left to right. semitic way of writing from right to the left
      may make them enmious with the rest of the world, because their
      eye-movements are the opposite of outs, and we trust them when
      they lie, yet we distrust them when they speak the truth. <font
        color="#cccccc">Huh, that's unexpected. I find it as I write.
        Before I stumbled across it, I&nbsp; </font><br>
      And that sentence promises delight in the future, which is only
      natural.<br>
      Because delight is what I saw to be happening in my capsules,
      where each move will lead to ecstasy.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      When I speak of morphemes, people tend to ask if I speak of the
      roots, but aphexes may matter more: <br>
      ушёл убежал улетел умчал убрался и так далее - приставка самая
      важная часть этих глаголов по смыслу, потому что смена приставки
      может изменить это слово на антоним. у is probably the same u as
      in away and out. It's funny that I don't immediately see it
      neither in прочь not in долой, but I definitely see it in вон.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      And that probably relates to в (in) relating to bu (no) as if at a
      hunt, there's no animal, if the animal is hidden in the ground
      somewhere.<br>

      New high session. Saturday, to my surprise. I didn't manage to
      give up weed, because I have broken my motivation by not paying
      back my brother his due. I made an unhonorable misdeed by not
      sticking to the verbal contract, and now I cannot do it because
      the state took him away. And I have to smoke to create this
      research instead of building my capsule. If I began building my
      capsule, I'd surely be sober more likely. I don't need being high
      to build that. Unfortunately, it seems I must smoke weed to be
      auistic enough to write this thing. It takes me many years now,
      some people wrote that ten or even twenty years it took some
      scientists to come up with their righteous theories. So I make it
      publicly for over 7 years now, so I expect it to bring fruits in
      over 2 years or so. I also made it secretly for over ten years
      before that. So <font color="#cccccc">in </font>2024 or 2025 <font

      abe iotu would be the words if we wanted to combine those five
      vowels, b and t into one word, the best I could do is two. abey
      jotu. obey to a jew? <br>
      <br>
      abei otu abei lotu (l ~ I) these words I pull out of the blue. I
      try them on. If they're no good I will look for something more,
      don't worry about it, please.<br>

      I didn't speak enough about what I did here.<br>

      I think I took the 16-rune set as they present it and found that A
      and E is the same Ææ<br>
      that is why B rune looks like F in the short twig variant:<br>
      <img src="12_files/younger_futhark_runic_alphabet.jpg" alt=""
        width="422" height="267"><br>
      And luckily it is a 16-rune sent, and I see that it doesn't hae e
      or g.<br>
      Thus my arrangement seems to be even more based than I even
      thought.<br>
      <br>

      <font color="#cccccc">Looking at old russian flag, I see notes of
        german flags. Only then I see that those brown flags (russian
        wite black yellow is even more brown than white black red, and I
        see that russian flag in modern german one, only whites are
        substituted with the reds. </font><br>

        I should stop trying to contact religious people. As one pastor
        told me, religions are to control the masses, not to understand
        the world. Maybe professional jews are the smartest believers,
        htey're believers nevertheless, so I will confuse their belief
        system. I wanted to say that something is wrong with them, but
        yes, this argument is much more important (was something wrong
        with me when I believed? I wouldn't think so, other than the
        assumption was thoroughly arbitrary, just as what if, let's
        learn to believe. Let's learn to believe. Belief can take towns.
        Often it took towns down. <br>
        <br>
        Mye will e is good. But you know how they say of the good

      Interesting is the way that reconstructed order of younger futhark
      lays down into the axial structure:<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      It's as if ᛅ is a form of ᚾ and we have ourself three
      5-letter-long lines with t reflecting f and d reflecting g and
      what else? <br>
      I would replace the ᛦᚱ with ᚱᛦ, actually the way they're in
      bornholm alphabet stone. Because ᛦ is transliterated as R and my
      bold guess is that ᚱ is П, mistransliterated because of how much ᚱ
      reminds R. Yet it's not a coincidence, because russian R looks
      like Р. <font color="#cccccc">(and even without the dot)</font><br>
      And now I see that then ᛘ reflects ᛦ<br>
      and ᚼ for sh reflects ᛋ for s.<br>
      But then again I doubt I cannot compare anything. So let's leave
      this ultracomparativistics and stick to new and more certain
      technics: the classical comparatevistic techniques of comparing
      words, not letters. Even if those words are the same letter. As I
      did with a and others in the previous volume, as I promised in the
      beginning of this one, at this stage we deliver the same
      comparison at much larger scale and with much more advanced
      technology.<br>

      but how dare I use slavic for the latin alphabet? Maybe because I
      допускаю этрусские корни у славян. Хотя мне присылали книгу где
      связывали этрусков с кельтами, но кто знает нет ли генетической и
      культурной связи меж ирландцами и руснёй. И те и другие вполне
      по-европейски выглядят, и вроде странная русская р у них тоже
      присуствует, или это у шотландцев, или у обеих наций, ах я не
      знаю, ололо. Это всё в любом случае голословно, так what are you

      И позиция фишек будет правильной или неправильной, если ты
      повернёшь их в ту или не ту сторону. В советской торговли счёты
      располагались фишками справа. Т.о. поворот посолонь скидывал счёты
      в начальное положение.&nbsp; <br>

      all videos in russian and ukrainian I saw show them arranged like
      that.<br>
      <br>
      Существует традиция, скидывающая счёты и в другую сторону,
      практически любое видео на английском распологает её с другой
      стороны, так что сброс будет против часовой, но я не нашёл видео с
      практическим применением оного, так что я решил оставить вам
      разобрать это самим, кто знает насколько компетентны те
      ютуб-блоггеры, и не попугайничают ли они друг за другом.<br>
      <br>
      Забавно, что японские счёты располагают строки вертикально, также
      как и классическое китайское письмо, но в отличие от него они
      похоже начинают счёт слева:<br>

      (сбрасываются они специальной кнопкой, так что вращение к ним
      неприменимо.<br>
      и не только японцы так ими пользуются, но похоже что и индусы и
      многие другие англоязычные, оставлю эту тему тоже пока что в
      стороне)<br>

      turd~dirt (probably these are cognates with for whatever reason

      şi is and in romanian. These short words, which are monoliteral in
      some languages are the key to finding the other short words of
      that monosyllabic period. And then we'll link these words to
      chinese hieroglyphics. Showing how the same sounds spread through
      all the other conceptions.<br>

      The way words can be the same in languages of different "family"

      is it some case english philology doesn't know much about. её?
      isn't it how they make accusative in japanese? Did this o work

      Many slavic languages have identical prepositions and even when
      they seem to not know some forms, they're still found in some
      biliteral: polish doesn't know k, but uses ku instead (russians
      use both к and ко, and that ko shows that it is exactly
      internationally known co- prefix, which is to also because some
      languages prefer до (do) intead of that ku, prefer d to c, and
      here we see how alphbaet could be the collection of these short
      words. And yet I wonder how could it be that в is not known in
      english)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Why do I rely on this random collection of the shortest words. I
      have to call my partner in this to tell him that I need my program
      now to make my own collection of these words.<br>

      Because 3 ~ З.<br>
      and now I see that IVX would be more traditional form of those.<br>
      and yet that AVZ I came upto is probably how that IVX was read.<br>
      I as ay or aye?<br>
      V as in? в (yet what is вон? I thought it was related to out and
      away, but it seems -он is no.<br>
      X as out? ex<br>
      <br>
      <i>вон</i> as <i>not inside</i> hypothesis.. <br>
      гон это то, что не пойдёт?<br>
      alone = al(l are) no(t her)e<br>
      tone = не тёмный? or to- as dye? but that would have some opposite
      meaning. I shouldn't stretch it this much.<br>

        is some weird chinese vowel for duh. as if it's yeah but in such
        wild chinese phonology, it's weirder than ы.<br>
        <br>
        both d and j are lingual, so what do I worry? they're from
        different lines, that's all, different dialects but the same
        word. Language is thousand-head chimera, words are much less
        abstract thing. Words are much more real. Words exist throughout
        languages. It's not how many languages you know, it's how many
        words you recognize across cultures. <br>
        <br>
        Modern academia is supported by go-t, and thus socialistisch,
        and as a result, ineffective. When business makes science, they
        make much better job about it. Human Genome was a private
        initiative, which go-t only tried to subvert. Was successful in
        spite of go-t.<br>

        n and m are the labial, reflecting b, бв, and thus they're bu,
        no, in- im- il- ir- all sonors are variants of one another,
        sonors before some letters stand:<br>
        il is only before l<br>
        ir is only beore r<br>
        (thus they don't matter much, they're.. or do they? they're some
        n's or m's I think. ᚱ as a form of ᚢ again.<br>
        im is before m, p, <br>
        un-is only n, unbelievable, <br>
        in is boefore v, t, c, d, <br>
        why does in- go un- before b? <br>
        u ~ i? <i>и</i> is i in russian.<br>
        so un is some basal form? because u is always with n in it,
        unlike i.<br>
        u and i are the pronouns? could be but then u ~ i and thus ya
        (you) ~ я [ya] (I) and that is how second person is whethere
        some pronoun of the first person or the third person (you or
        thee, we or they, you and we both could be some of uvw, the
        letter as a word. <br>
        <br>
        I as a form of U and thus A is a form of I and U, if the lines
        repeat themselves in differnt dialects, and thus c ~ g ~ з
        cognito сознаю. со ~ з?! what is наю then? как в наитие,

        Before I have that program, let's play as if I only know two
        languages because all the other languages are lost. Let's only
        play with russian and english. Or let's even start with only
        russain, because I know it the best.<br>

        Seeing how alphabet company colours remind my structure <img
          moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/alphabet_and_aeiou.png"
          alt="" width="225" height="119"> standing next to it in my
        favourites, made me play with my .ico a little and those letters
        again made me think of those timelines of AD and BC as if the
        modern AD period is how our laphabet goes: first line of it is
        A-D and then BC would be how itwas in the ancient past. B as the
        first letter, C as shin, and no air, just water of B and fire of
        C (ash) and if C is ash (I thought of shin as the sefer
        yetzirah's mother) and I see that thus C ~ H ~ X ~ ƆC and here I
        think of F ~ H and H as Ⱶ and maybe even as ᚴ<br>
        <br>
        I think I sent into google my book. Do they secretly read it and
        that is why they arranged colours like this? Alphbet they call
        themselves now. Whether because they're hijacking the term
        "alphabet agencies" or because they actually what.. they make
        business with my science simply because I use their services
        also for free. I even adblock the commercial on youtube and they
        seem to be fine with this. But if they read this book, I wonder
        why their G is so weird, as if it's asian k-first thing, but why
        does it go couter-clockwise then? Because if it's normal
        red-blue-and_so_on, then why does yellow goes after green? <br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/google_logo.jpg"
          alt="" width="48" height="48"> So I think it's
        counter-clockwise eastern canon. Do they wiz against them or do
        they just used the rainbow order going the way G goes, they
        didn't invent the letter, but then why doesn't their M follow
        the rainbow? <br>
        But visually it won't be better, if we go with our rainbow
        clockwise: <img moz-do-not-send="true"

        - without teeth I don't bite by own cheeks and lips.<br>
        - wihtout teeth I eat less. I need to remove them to balance my
        weight. I'm overweight all the time. it's almost 30 extra kilos,
        like wtf!<br>
        + teeth give some aestetic, but that's it. They also help to
        eat, but I see it as disadvantage in my case.<br>
        + they used to be used as instrument (to bite off something) but
        today metal instruments are to be used.<br>
        <br>
        That is actually one of the wilder inventions (or ideas) beyond
        the capsule thing. I see myself as closer to the embryo as
        possible, because I haven't seen the disadvantages of that state
        yet. That state seems to be the ultimate. The naturally
        developed state. Not chaos we're in. <br>

        The academic dogmas are so strong, that<br>
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Greek_alphabet#Hyginus'_account





        <br>
        used to say literally the following:<br>
        <font size="+1">[[Hyginus]] recounts the following legend about
          the introduction of Phoenician letters to Greece</font><br>
        about this chapter:<br>
        <font size="+1">The three Fates created the first five vowels of
          the alphabet and the letters B and T. It is said that
          Palamedes, son of Nauplius invented the remaining eleven
          consonants. Then Hermes reduced these sounds to characters,
          showing wedge shapes because cranes fly in wedge formation and
          then carried the system from Greece to Egypt*. This was the
          Pelasgian alphabet, which Cadmus had later brought to Boeotia,
          then Evander of Arcadia, a Pelasgian, introduced into Italy,
          where his mother, Carmenta, formed the familiar fifteen
          characters of the Latin alphabet. Other consonants have since
          been added to the Greek alphabet. Alpha was the first of
          eighteen letters, because alphe means honor, and alphainein is
          to invent.</font><br>
        Naturally I had to change that line into<br>
        <font size="+1">[[Hyginus]] recounts the following legends about
          the development of the alphabet<br>
        </font><br>
        What if 'd in I'd is more based than had. The more basal, the
        more primitive, a part of had.<br>
        <br>
        Because that is literally -ed and thus it can be attached not
        only to verbs. I'd see would then means I saw? I did see? -ed is
        did? no, did is ed added to do. doed is did but oe's <br>
        s is present<br>
        d is past<br>
        l is future<br>
        all three suffixes are lingual, I wonder why. Maybe because they
        used to be the same letter and divided into times later. <br>
        Object's something<br>
        Object'd something<br>
        Object'll something<br>
        that -ing in the first case is like someth's a verb.<br>
        is and was - the other way to turn present into past. And I
        don't see not future form in this system, and thus this sistem
        is more ancient and from times where we didn't know future. No
        wonder those legends of ясновидящих appeared, and in russian it
        specifies: not only seeing, but seeing clear (and not a word
        about the future too, because those detectives could see into
        both futue and the past)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;clairvoyant is the english word, even though it's french.
        And a complete calque in russian.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Japanese ie for yea and iie for не makes me speculate:<br>
        is their no literally да-да? and is it standing for take and
        give (two times da, where da is ta in take and да in дай. and is
        that <i>g</i> (russina д looks like this in cursive) is <i>д</i>
        in times when we considered all the linguals one or few letters
        and didn't distinguish between give and take, because it is the
        same action actually. And were ke in take and ve in give the
        prefixes we know in russian in their pure forms of в &amp; к? <br>
        <br>
        v and k are they not only in and to, but also вы and ik?<br>
        <br>
        so ta is da (duh) <br>
        and take is ta ik (I give, даю я)<br>
        and give is ga U (give you, да<font color="#cccccc">й</font> вы)<br>
        <br>
        and most probably those are the same g and д (g is д in russian
        cusive, they both are and thus they remind cursive ד (looks like
        3 with a bubble at the cenral bridge) while ג and ז look like
        mirror reflections of each-other, which relates to that c ~ g
        thing (so I take from modern "dogmas" what I find fit and reject
        what doesn't fit into my theory, how convenient. So I banter
        myself too, so when I banter you please take it easy) <br>

        because what follows is they admit that funk is an euphemism for
        fuck. So are folk music fuck music? Makes sense for rhythm could
        be invented to keep the lovers in the same tempo. And thus they
        would speed at the same time and came to the culmination at the
        same moment. <br>
        Or is it the same word, because fucks is what folks do, and thus
        that's how they're different from their children. And once
        children got puberty, and thus both interest and ability to have
        sex, they soon become folks themselves.<br>

        rave and rake? more obscure words return more obscure results.<br>
        <br>
        but stave and stake are great. <br>
        So these pairs are great for learning the language, but we
        descend even further into the past and thus we know what exactly
        is in there and we have to learn only about tens of morphemes,
        maybe only two and the others are the further implications of
        those. We'll see. yin-yang model seems to be in the root of it
        all, I yet have to reach it from the point of modern lexics. I
        jumped into the future of my work, but now I wonder if it
        doesn't disturb the truth I yet have to deliver, if my
        preconceptions won't distort it.<br>
        <br>
        but slave and have don't have the pairs with ke as far as I can

        когда как в фамилиях I know surnames ending with вец, but not
        nets. Even Lenny and Nina are Кравец, где вец тот же самый вич
        как в петрович, диалектные различия невелики. <br>
        Вери блади сёрнэйм иф зэт крев из славик. ик вик тот же самый
        вич и виц. вик. вый is also in this band. and that is how k is
        among i's. and if l is in this I-gang, I look at -el suffix and
        ask is it a varinat of -вич? but the closest to -el I can do is
        in мишкин is михайлов is михайлович.<br>
        so what is -ич and why do we need it? it's их. их как ich?
        товарищ товарич. я шутил что тваричи, но товаричи, их родители
        лишь товар. их родителей продали как товар. <br>
        <br>
        -in is that very n of нец которое вец, в которая in. I don't

        in russia we have two types of surnames: ending with ov/ёv/ev

        is -ov surnames add v to that very o?<br>
        okolniko doesn't look like ukraian surname, it would probably be
        okolnika in there. some surnames of the region end with -a
        gangha (ganzha) is my favourite. ganghin it would be in russian,

        ABGD makes more sense than ABCD because they say that it was

        faith. But not to be that scientist, I must dig that claim, o

        gives it in the reference, then dig further for he reference,
        maybe also to see a hearsay.<br>
        <br>
        ABGD makes more sense, because then we see more clearly that
        it's voiced before voiceless, and we see it in russian more than
        in hebrew or greek even. Which tells that maybe russians are

        through our eyes and ears and nostrils. and multitude of other
        sensors.<br>

        as if mix-up voiced and voiceless, making the alphabet balanced,
        or what was the direction? Maybe the russians inventors decided
        to arrange letters in that order? But ABGD in greek too. Did it
        happen in greek or is it the source of their dogma that latin
        had ABGD in the beginning too, because they took it from greeks.
        Probably. so, did they or did they not? Greeks and russians have
        more distorted abcd sequences, thus they were the ones who
        mutilated it for their new structure, voiced first, voiceless
        later. In military sense it would make sense, because
        avant-guarde has to call all the others, and they should have
        been there as fans but also to protect their star. <br>

        I marked those "sonors" in orange. The first of them, Й, is
        literally short I (И-краткое)<br>
        And L is probably a form of I and thus N ~ И (in both form and
        function: 'n' is и)<br>
        и ~ на? n is no or and? an? a is an, and? a is and in other
        language, in russians. <br>
        But fuck that meme. rus is trus and village people. slavs are
        slaves. Let's invent something else. Parmiaks. Пермяками быть

        Greek ΖΗΘΙΚΛΜΝ sequence reminds russian ЗИЙКЛМН only russians
        removed their Ѳ and among that the sequences are pretty much the
        same: Η after Ζ is naturally russian И after З. <br>
        and it is wonderful how they disagree about which is I and which
        is J. <br>
        Russians left only H vowel, greeks have both H and I vowel
        actualy, but I before K is Й before К.<br>
        <br>
        ΖΗΘ is substituted with ЁЖЗ in russian <br>
        H is ᚼ(or ᛡ) in norsk.<br>
        and З is naturally Ζ<br>
        thus Ё is Θ<br>
        they made рокировку () in greece? or in russia? latin doesn't
        have that mess. And russian second line is surprisingly close to
        latin than to greek:<br>
        EFGH<br>
        ЕЁЖЗ - but no, it's not, here I must explain why we have ז<br>
        ה ו ז ח ט<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; h g f e<br>
        hebrew seems to have ו ז ח ט both and modern greek doesn't have
        the first labial, modern latin doesn't have the last one. I
        guess it's the same labial (one per line) and for whatever
        reason voiced and voiceless was divided here, is it where the
        voiceless set appeared, and before that 7 letters were enough.<br>
        maybe even six if only plosives and glides they were, teh first
        two lines, but there're thre aettirs, but four (or even five, if
        you accept the fifth) aikme<font color="#cccccc"> or is it
          aikmen, I am still lost in their grammar, I don't know it
          plain and simple.</font><br>
        So like yin and yang, there used to be two lines: voiced and
        voiceless, syllabary of two vowels. A and E<br>
        or A and U in other nations, and somehow those u and и (u and и)
        met and gave offsprings, and thus five vowels. AUI pure vowel,
        labial and lingual vowels, the ogham order of vowels, and nobody
        else's, as far as I know so far.<br>
        so there were three parents to two children? e is between a and
        i (ai is e in some orthography, but not english, the best
        english can offer is said.<br>
        au is o<br>
        that is how letters came into being.<br>
        But creative force didn't stop there, and people found я in ia
        and ю in iu and ui is probably w.<br>
        <br>
        if ui is w, then i is short, as in i-short, short, like mice say
        i, but elephants say u. <br>
        u is labial for big<br>
        i is lingual for short<br>
        Hobot rassmatrivalsa kak guba? guba truba? <br>
        <br>
        vowel as no: to omit (not to mention)<br>
        tion is деяние<br>
        dios thus is doing, doer, creator.<br>
        deus thus is деющий<br>
        -s as active suffix, -ing<br>
        -n is passive suffix -ed<br>
        and though all four are lingual, ing and n are closer to m then
        to s, and what does it tell? maybe nothing, keep on digging.<br>
        done gone, these ancient words have very peculiar form of -ed.<br>
        russian form, the form russians still use. so was -ed -eл (д and
        л look alike in both kirillica and glagollica: ⰄⰎ - and the
        first sign usually has the left bubble half the hight, as others
        of that sight, but unicode makers chose this, later, form of it,
        the one used into modern times by srbsk-hrvatsk brothers) <br>
        So what I say? that d and l are invariants? I love this
        irrational word. l is russian d is english? <br>
        dark mrak seem to push l further, not into n, but m.<br>
        rak could be as in zrak (pupil of the eye) который от слова зри
        (see) зрак зрящий, seeing.<br>
        зрачок маленький зрак, как значок маленький знак. и это ко то же
        что и в японском. Даже не столько слова существуют, сколько вот
        такие корокие силлабеллы. silly bellies, silly because we think
        they mean nothing, or they mean too much, so we recognize them
        as silly, purely phonetic. <br>
        And they used to mean something, neh, but in different contexts
        they're understood as whole words without minding the components
        of those words. The linguistic problem of correct and wrotng
        words was known in ancient times, not anymore. Those quests were
        probably labeled obsolete or heretical and only post-christian
        science was accepted as valuable source. Yet linguistics is not
        where it should be, machine learning is completely independent
        field, and they reported linguists only harmful to their
        science, thus linguistics is pseudo-science<font color="#999999">
          (mostly because they're very reluctant to question their
          dogmas <font color="#cccccc">(my guess is because those dogma
            are political in nature)</font>)</font> And declaring this I
        dare to what.. I dare to say that my clumsy steps are the
        foundation of the truer science about language. What should I
        call them? grammatology is a shitty term from the start, and
        it's taken by the thieves, so let's find something else:<br>
        let's make some poetry.<br>

        What interests me in that picture the most is the way they draw
        three signs in dots, and they're alphabetic:<br>
        one dot for M<br>
        two dots for H<br>
        three dots for I<br>
        and because both those diacritized M and H stand before K, I
        consider all three of those letters be considered vowel. Labial
        vowel first, Lingual vowel last, the neutral vowel between them,
        but we must hear how those letters are pronounced to claim
        anything about them.<br>
        But it's not that easy to find anybody pronouncing those
        letters. And most of the scholars don't seem to know of those
        vowel M and H.<br>
        <br>
        Those dots actually once again link brahmic to one
        geographically distinct writing system, the Tifinagh.<br>
        But unicode doesn't deliver those dot-signs for brahmic, the
        only dot signs it shows are these:<br>
        &nbsp; 𑀀𑀁𑀂&nbsp; 𑀇&nbsp; 𑀈<br>
        𑀇 is i<br>
        𑀈 is ī (and looks differently in other fonts, as | with dots on
        both sides, like ⴶ with those dots not on the top, but at the
        middle of that |, somewhat higher than in .|. (just in case,
        here it is supposed to look as four dots in the shape of a
        square. And because it's some form of i, it is interesting that
        actually tifinagh ⴶ&nbsp; is dʒ, just as j, which is also a form
        of i.<br>
        𑀀𑀁𑀂 sign seem to be some diacritic (because it loks like this
        in other font:&nbsp; and it is not on wiktionary, and that is
        how deep I dig. Not very deep.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        So I was looking for those kshatrapa, junnar, andhra, but those
        dots are not there, yet some curious stuff can be found by those
        key words. For example, this:<br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naneghat"><img
            moz-do-not-send="true"
src="12_files/1911_sketch_of_numerals_script_history_ancient_India,_mathematical_symbols_shapes.jpg"
            alt="" width="1208" height="614" border="0"></a><br>
        <br>
        and watching the abundance of the used signs in
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_script I once again remeber
        that enormous list of very different post-brahmic scripts and
        once again think that the east could easily be the source of all
        the writing systems, so many of them it has.<br>
        <br>
        But then I see some <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G50nq68VPuM"><font
            color="#000000">hindu</font></a> telling that India has not
        one, but two sources of literacy: brahmi that was written left
        to right and kharoshti, which was written right to left, and I
        look into kharoshti, and I find that double dot H: <br>
        𐨏&nbsp;&nbsp; which is called visarga:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visarga<br>
        (and there you can see that it's not only horizontal, but
        vertical too)<br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharosthi"><img
            moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/hindi_diacritics.png"
            alt="" width="1148" height="597" border="0"></a><br>
        <br>
        <font size="+1">The precise phonetic function of the dot below
          is unknown. It is used with m and h</font><br>
        <font color="#999999">(and probably that m is the same m which
          that table where it all began from mentions)</font><br>
        But why would I look into kharoshti when I needed to find some
        brahmi?<br>
        Most of all because I'm desperate because I didn't find them in
        brahmic scripts, and whatever.<br>
        Why do I look into writing systems I don't know much about? I am
        so much out of my depth.<br>
        I told myself I have to leave it to ai, but I'm whether proud or
        obey to the habit way too much.<br>
        I will take a toke and look into something else, you watch me:<br>
        <br>
        Ohay, and our later and I fuck up al the academia<br>

        I'm waiting for some better program about these graphs, I have a
        prototype of it, it even works:<br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph1english.png"
          alt="" width="764" height="518"><br>
        It probably was some academic text, they are taught not to use
        I's. weird, huh. make them selfless.<br>
        but check the biliteral words from the same text (the lists are
        not complete, just the most often ones.<br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph2.png" alt=""
          width="778" height="536"><br>
        No me's (but few my's) definitely something academic.<br>
        Compare it with the previous example, obviously less prudent:<br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true"

          width="790" height="536"><br>
        Different texts, different in size also, slightly different
        results, but the first three words are the same.<br>
        of to in.<br>
        But because of their similarity and symmetry I only look at of
        and to, because they're the good two mothers ot the shortest
        english word a. what is I then? the a and I probably were the
        first two vowels:<br>
        they make great syllabary, because i palatalizes lettes while a
        does not.<br>
        and u the opposite of their spectre probably appeared when the
        concept of second person appeared.<br>
        <br>
        of and to show the opposite direction. of you or to you. of me
        or to me. take is to thee? ke as the opposite of ik? give is
        that ke and vi is me? where's ta in give? I thought both t and g
        are d, some do.. or дай (give) <br>
        дай ~ дей (деть наоборот брать, а не дать "куда дели" where did
        you place it, so in this sense also where did you give it?<br>
        давать девать<br>
        одевать. положить вокруг себя? о ~ около ~ om (in dutch)<br>

        As you can see, the program is raw, I requested it to be
        improved so I enjoy working with it.<br>
        <br>
        also not all of those words are actually words:<br>
        — : 2<br>
        – : 2<br>
        и : 319<br>
        а : 82<br>

        г : 1<br>
        <br>
        ф is from <font size="+1">германските воени групи Е и Ф</font><br>
        w is from some <font size="+1">W0506</font><br>
        д is also some personal.. they call it proper noun, such a term
        for personal memes <font size="+1">Денот Д</font><br>
        <br>
        и = and<br>
        a = and (but) another and, with a little bit of but in it. more
        butty but is но (no)<br>
        е = is<br>
        <br>
        google translate doesn't tell me of their а today, but it knows
        it because it translates sentences with that word well:<br>

        на is translated as of in that sentence, so even though they're

        slavic languages:<br>
        oд and до in makedonian is от и до ин рашшн.<br>
        That scarcity of to can be very important to understand our
        mentality. But let's feed there some other text, some scientific
        text in makedonian. Or fuck makedonian, lets' work in russian,
        at least I know that.<br>
        <br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph1russian.png"
          alt="" width="1634" height="581"><br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph2russian.png"
          alt="" width="1634" height="605"><br>
        I didn't know that na (on) is so popular in slavic languages,
        even though that book (собачье сердце) doesn't have the jewish
        -please (-na) which is considered rune in russian as if that -na
        is nahooy (to penis, yet that to is also на in russian)<br>
        And now, in that book and in russian the most popular words are
        the same as in that makedonian text, but now they're in
        alphabetic order: и, во, на (vowel, labial, lingual, in this
        order)<br>
        So for some better comparison, I use the very same book in
        english translation:<br>
        russian: <font size="+1">http://www.eunet.lv/library/win/BULGAKOW/dogheart.txt</font><br>
        english: <font size="+1">https://archive.org/stream/MikhailBulgakovTheHeartOfADog/Mikhail-Bulgakov-The-Heart-Of-A-Dog_djvu.txt</font><br>
        and to my surprise in gets up front, leaving those to and of
        behind:<br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph1english...png"
          alt="" width="1634" height="584"><br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph2english...png"
          alt="" width="1634" height="618"><br>
        and the most popular of all short words, the a, of, to, arranged
        in alphabetic order, btw, lead the charts.<br>
        it's interesting that in russian the leaders are also arranged
        alphbaetically: и(i) в(v) на(na) (and, in, on)<br>
        in that makedonian text (some other text, in some different
        genre) the first three were the same, but in different order:
        на, во, и.<font color="#999999"> (в and во are the same word in
          russian<font color="#cccccc"> (like a and an in english)</font>)</font><br>
        And yes, there are more frequent words in that text:<br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph3english...png"
          alt="" width="4749" height="589"><br>
        That and is the very russian и and their the russians don't have
        is the leader of them all. which is really super weird. About
        2.5 times more the's than a's. <br>
        a : 934<br>
        the : 2358<br>
        an : 92<br>
        Even with an, the is more than twice as often as a and an
        combined.<br>
        <font color="#999999">Is it because in that book objects are
          named three times? Once when they're not known and twice
          later?</font><br>
        Just to compare it to russian to see that no russian word of
        three letters can compete with the shorter ones, from the same
        book, the leaders are still и, во, на:<br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/graph3russian.png"
          alt="" width="5150" height="637"><br>
        This part is so boring to me, because there has to be hundreds
        of these graphs and some cold-hearted machine should be
        analyzing them. While I'm already tired of these few and try to
        pull assumptions from these few too: that на is also used not
        only for on, but also for take. And that fact makes me think if
        во has some meaning of give, like as if во is мо<font
          color="#cccccc">ё</font> or фу (don't take)<br>
        <br>
        I doubt I should do it, that's not what it was about. Or was it?
        Time to smoke, Good morning. 12:24, Tuesday (it's Thursday, I
        was even unaware of that) I'm not giving it up because I don't
        have nothing better to do, and I have nothing better to do
        because I smoke and thus cannot deal with some serious people I
        have to deal. Few hours later and I haven't smoked yet. But it
        is coming. <br>
        another hour passed, and I made some heavy work (I would never
        do it being high, way to heavy, way too brutal, some minor
        damage to my skin is caused by it, some dirty air breathed in,
        totally counter-survival. completely against the main idea of
        mine that perfect condition will maybe allow us not to get old,
        or at least not to die of some other factors, and aging will be
        solved by biotech, and probably it already is, btw. I only have
        to earn much money in time to get it.<br>
        <br>
        And here I am at 15:22 with such a subject as матерные слова.<br>
        For some long time I suspect that some words were considered
        dirty because they were too basal, too picturesque, or for
        whatever reason, it could be just a demonstration of power when
        people were prohibited to speak their own language, I have an
        anecdotal evidence about it from some iranian gay man. <br>
        16:30 I was out, reading more about Solzhenitsyn than himself.<br>
        16:59 and I'm reading this:<font size="+1">

        It seems that work damaged my creativity by taking my powers to
        make it. That is why I cannot have a job (an hour long hand
        labour is the easiest job of all and still it takes this sparkle
        out of me. Let's smoke more maybe? Let's try regain hat spark.
        Let's eat first. Or drink lots of water. I eat a jelly and drink
        some warm water, and maybe I will not smoke anymore, to be
        continued.<br>
        And there he makes the same misdead I do: we don't mind
        collaborating with the regime. He actually use the perestroica
        term. He gave them a clue to survive into 21th century. They had
        to fall and jews would perish when archives were open, people
        would start asking why the fuck there were so many jews,
        unproportionally many, and they wouldn't even get to who were
        the other half of the mother fuckers (old russian elite) before
        they slaughtered kikes (who reasonable left before perestroika
        pretending to be russians and giving russians bad
        reputation.&nbsp; These love-hate parasite-host relations will
        always exist and always conclude the seed of the military or
        civil conflicts. So what is the solution for it would be? My
        grmmar is grate.<br>
        <br>
        I ate and drank but I still discuss politics instead of science.
        That is how dumbened down I am by that heavy duty work. I should
        stope pretending that I'm a.. I wanted to say that I should stop
        being an architect, but I actually have to build with hired
        workers' menpower.<br>
        Or I have to avoid weed when I do heavy work, because it will
        not help me to ascend where I'm allowed in some other days.

        Так почему же Солженицын заигрывает с советской властью? Только
        ли ради радения о русских или то лишь предлог? Может он
        позиционировал себя и кем-нибудь воспринимался как внештатный
        аналитик, ведь как писал Гиммлер, советская власть сама
        организует протесты против себя. И в отличие от Амальрика (о
        котором я лишь от него узнал, при том что того выпустили из
        тюрьмы народов на мой месяц рождения (не знаю точного дня когда
        он выехал)<br>
        Амальрик, возможно, не заигрывал, и кто знает истинные причины
        его смерти спусты четыре года после освобождения. Солженицын не
        только выжил, но был и тепло принят путиным. Я, значит, не
        заигрываю с властью? И он и я заигрывать с ней вынуждены, потому
        что, как он справедливо заметил, на восстание русского народа
        надежды нет: их волю сломили, и если они не быковали когда их
        пиздец крепили, то теперь-то чего, типа после драки кулаками не
        машут.<br>
        Лишь надежда на очередного Хрущёва у него, и через десять лет
        доставили Горбачёва. Какой ещё лысый гад нас освободит от
        режима? Лысый у нас сейчас, но это ленинообразная фигура,
        паутинный персонажик. Следующий будет волосатый, и нам очень
        повезёт если навального поставят, хотя я и воспринимаю его тоже
        как пример власти, организующей протесты против себя самой. Дабы
        выявить ех, кто в этом многострадальном народе ещё способен
        помыслить о сопротивлении.<br>
        <br>
        оберечь или обречь (первое слово очень редкое, морфологически
        вполне понятное, но у солженицына прочитал его впервые за долгое
        время, так что сложно было понять как обречь, почему обречь. а..
        оберечь. Но что если это subliminal programming of some sort?
        What if he winks them that finally this zaraza will hit the
        opponents of ours, the progressive west (I suspect progressive
        to be some marker word: neither progressive metal nor
        progressive trance are good) so I believe in the good old west.
        Simply being the best and doing what it can the best. No more
        brother wars this time.<br>
        Do I promote wars with some other races? We never had much
        interest fighing other races. Or am I ignoring the conquests of
        Cyberia and America? The imperialist in me.. We have to outlaw
        all wars. Violence is abhorent, and then we have to prevent
        go-ts from commiting it against their citizens. They're
        independent persons, they don't belong to the state. But what am
        I going to do to criminals? <br>
        I'm going to expose them so all their sins will be available to
        everybody doing business with them.<br>
        What if they ignore it and openly exterminate the opposition?
        Isn't it what the go-t does? <br>
        Okay, I dropped reading solzhnitsyn's letter in the middle. His
        demand to develop the north-east, because we didn't develop is
        enough is atrocious. He definitely works for the commies. He
        teaches them how to reign us better. He told them to reject the
        ideology, they did. He told them to stop the progress, to make
        economy static, and that seems to be what they did. And what if
        that was how he fucked them up. What if that good advice to
        reject the stale ideology was just a bait to make them fall into
        some static state, which would make them incompetent to compete
        with the West. Could be, could be. But they were failing to
        compete beofre that, don't I think? It certainly was a trick. I
        rejected to read it more, but how did it sound almost fifty
        years ago? <br>
        So, finally I read it through and I can see that soviet
        establishment definitely read that letter. <br>

        is it.. pas and cul?<br>
        pas as advantage makes pastures very important for success. <br>
        cul for as makes our civilization very homosexual. but probably
        culture is what's cool.<br>
        Is cool some ancient word for good? I don't know and actually
        doubt it. But as I spoke about unofficial languages, those words

        I felt like I needed some pictures and I found these two I used
        before, now let's compare them side by side:<br>

        They're mostly coherent, yet they're different. The one on the
        right gives some minority report about Η and unlike the table on
        the right it tells that they all (and Ionian too) considered Η
        consonant. And both pictures agree that only ionian knew Ω which
        may show that first the priests of apollo (probably being
        ionian) added only one string to apollo's lyre. And that was
        long o? Because if both these tables are correct, they speak
        about different epochs maybe. But then again there's replication
        crisis and we can only be sure that Η and Ω are the two
        additional strings. Maybe Η was more high than Ι and Ω was twice
        deeper than Ο, and what was Υ then who knows, but what am I
        doing, let's greeks decide it. Those who feel that language.<br>
        Other differences are about the use of that ☉-like Θ, how did
        they draw Ι in korinth, and others are some minor differences
        about some additional forms, such as Υ and D.<br>

        speaking of me trying to unite all the languages could be not

        I just noticed that they claim that the idea that the universe
        had no beginning and came out of nothing belongs to hawking. It
        is how they rewrite history, because while hawking was alive, he
        was considered to be the most vocal proponent of the big bang
        theory, which I noticed before (could be some vaticanese
        conspiracy) Do they keep some roman relics which allows them the
        world power? Some extraterrastrial technology of actually
        speaking to gods? whoever they were? some aliens working towards
        peace for their own convenience.<br>
        <br>
        So did hawking accept the opposite point of view or do they just
        fail to prevent us from noticing that their big bang dogma is
        inconsistent when looked at without some dialectics. dialieticks<br>
        <br>
        So now they will use принцип арнольда (different name in english
        by an accident or to divide national languages when they can?)
        to hide figures who proponed the bettery cosmology all along to
        conceal how they were shut down or what else they could say.

          Cancer goes next, and thus A B G C is how it goes, and if g

          Leo (L as D, interesting)<br>
          Virgo is Deva. And isn't L there because of L Г ()
          simmilarity? Because L is between C and D was born (Λ and Δ
          have lots in common too. and this Λ Δ order made me thnk that
          this could be a great sequence, where \ would be B, which
          would explain I for Z in ancient greek and check out the
          phoenician second line: 𐤄 𐤅 𐤆 𐤇 𐤈 something z-like for
          zain, Ч-like У I was looking for in the middle of for elements
          water notebook. E almost exactly like latin. So it seems
          phoenician is not hebrew indeed. What if they arranged hebrew
          alphabet to phoenician which indeed was an ancient incarnation
          of the alphabet as we know it, with Ф already removed from
          it's labial position and M also as we know it.. wait, what am
          I talking about, seeing Ф in 𐤈 when they also have quite
          labial vav in 𐤅 if that is vav and not some J (but we're
          taught (told) that Ё after Е was inserted by some female
          queens relatively recently, after peter the great. <br>
          But even if I rename Virgo as Deva, I will have random
          disorder further down the line. And if I take the first half
          for whatever reason (7 were before 12, it was better before, I
          have no proof though - such non-arguments are no good and I
          think I don't use them above, so this self-irony is
          unadequate, though my grammar is naturally foreign and wrong
          here and there)<br>
          <br>
          So what am I saying? That 𐤄 𐤅 𐤆 𐤇 𐤈&nbsp; is read
          differently? That 𐤅 is not v, but some г? ʒ? to align it with
          russian ж з sequence? nonsense. It's more likely that 𐤈
          indeed was t? because it has t inside? because romans
          pronounce it with tongues? Or that hebrew alphabet is a
          fabrication, because bible doesn't include abecedaries. It's
          not in their canon, even though that satanic codex has
          abecedaries at its cover (I included it in some chaotic
          section, I don't feel well posting something that emotionally
          charged, so I leave it in the previous volumes and will link
          to it from here when I make this book right)</font><br>

        Creation of alphabet happened after the invention of ovens, so
        alphbet could appear even in iceland, in norsk legend of Odin
        inventing runes and dice together? They say three mothers were
        at the pit of the well the tree grew from, so three mothers were
        known. And the next iteration is believed to be 7 vowels, b and
        t, but then it was some different development of the alphbaet:
        vowels were invented after only three letters existed. And at
        first there were 3 vowels (because some cultures have only 3,
        and maybe even only 2: palatalizing and not palatalizing. Some
        cultures disagree about where to put diacritic marks for i and
        u: arabs mark i's by a dot below, and u's by the mark above
        them, which is counter-intuitive to europeans, but probably
        that's how it was: europeans are zombified by modern music
        theory: I had memories of disagreeing with high notes being weak
        and sharp and low notes being profound and powerful. For a child
        it would be natural the other way around (and some musician gave
        me his anecdotal first-hand evidence that he had this cognitive
        dissonance too) so twice in this day I come to the urge to
        research arabic alphabet, for arabic alphabet could be even more
        true than hebrew (but wait till you dig georgian: they have
        additional line and they did arrange those letters perfectly
        right, and that book of georgian language in georgian language
        arranges letters by abcd lines, which tells those fuckers know
        that structure even now. other nations seem not to) which can be
        whatever, from thsoe tricksters we should expect any fucking
        thing, good and bad too. they may be unpredictable and anything
        would fit them. I hope they have self-preservance, and play it
        masterfullyto be loved all of the sudden. They will probably be
        the first to mutate en masse, because that would give them
        evolutionary advantage, and thus they would begin the urge of
        modifications in peoples, and for that they will be adored by
        many, especially if they remove what we hate them for, I hop<font

        to do the job. Unions are mafias.<br>
        <br>
        In soviet union, unions were subordinate to the state, to the
        employer. And how were they used? Naturally, they were working
        to control not the employer, but the employees: all those
        factory собрания после работы, после учёбы ли. <br>

        the hermeticism for my roof and I also bought paint and brush

        do re mi fa sol la si have interesting choice of vowels, as if
        it didn't go one way, but was some canonic melody:<br>
        do rE MI Fa sol lA SI (where syllables of the type aa are the
        lowest (in modern sense) and AA are the highest and aA and Aa
        are in between) and then it probably went as a wave in the form
        of N.<br>
        And knowng more canonic representation of it, I'd say that it
        was pentanonic up and down, like in this one: <br>

        and in my hypothesis those five notes were not chromatic, but
        nicely jumped to thirds to make five notes of what used to be
        only three grades, which is probably connected to the three
        accords as we know them, or maybe not, I don't know music well
        enough. But it would make a smoothest transition from three
        vowels to five of them.<br>
        I was thinking about something like this:<br>

        (click it, if the link's alive, there they even play it)<br>
        In the principle similar to what I saw in the greek modes
        sorting nodes into some up and down triads:<br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/071.jpg" alt=""
          width="756" height="317"><br>
        but looking for some other source for these tetrachords or
        whatever, I found this:<br>
        <font size="+1">Greek theory distinguished three different
          genera of tetrachords, producing an additional variety of
          modes. The previously described tetrachord (two descending
          whole tones plus one semitone) was called diatonic. There were
          also chromatic and enharmonic genera. The two tones bounding
          the tetrachord were fixed and always formed a perfect fourth;
          the two inner tones were movable. The chromatic tetrachord
          consisted of a minor third (encompassing 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
          whole tones) plus two semitones, the enharmonic tetrachord of
          a major third (encompassing two whole tones) plus two
          approximate quarter tones:<br>

        Those one-syllable sentences could lead me to some marrism. I'm

        them here for some ai-powered people who find normal literature
        boring read it in an evening) but when I'm ai-powered, I

        <font size="+1">Все слова всех языков имеют общее происхождение
          (моногенез), а именно от «четырёх элементов» — изначальных

          имевших никакого значения» и использовавшихся в магических
          целях); так называемая «лингвистическая палеонтология» может
          возвести любое слово к одному (или нескольким) из четырёх
          элементов. Это утверждение сочеталось с теорией изначальной
          множественности языков — несмотря на общий характер четырёх
          элементов, разные социальные группы придавали им разное
          значение. Способы выведения слов из «четырёх элементов» не
          носили сколько-либо строгого характера, на практике
          разрешались типичные для любительских упражнений в этимологии
          произвольные замены и перестановки звуков, отбрасывания частей
          слов (отождествлялись и возводились к элементу РОШ слова

        It is rather wicked, because if we align them as Ion, Ber, Rosh,
        Sal, we'll have something incredibly similar to alphabetic set,
        and because it's ABC, Ion, Ber, Sal, Rosh are also fine (or
        maybe not, because R stands before S) because ABC as a meme and
        many other sources suggest that&nbsp; only three elements used
        to be, but where does it lead me? Am I going to dig this
        stalinist piece of crap? I'm not, at least not yet. I told you,

        But then again, if these eastern and western signs are related,
        it's more likely that it went the other way around: european
        letters could be some simplistic phonetic chinese script. or had
        roots in it.<br>

        Мать расскаазала историю, что когда её вынули, бабушка
        спрашивает "а чего голова такая кривая?"врачи тогда взяли и
        вправили мозги помяв её как пластилин, почти нереальная, не
        поверил если бы сам от неё не слышал. И может это привело меня к
        изобретению тянуть себя за волосы. Если череп можно формировать
        как пластилин, то может сейчас его можно формировать как глину.
        Это же не обожённая в печи глина, это живая материя, лишь
        немногим жёщще хрящей. и то, что они решили, что по вертикальной
        нагрузке кость выдерживает автомобиль, то какой запас
        пластичности в той кости! это живая материя, и я уверен что она
        растягивается, но когда начал, я в этом не был уверен, и
        расчитывал на рост кости в области стыков, если я буду кости
        черепа в этом месте растягивать. Т.е. я уповал на ткань суставов
        (хотел сказать соединительная ткань, но кажется это не она,
        или.. рубцовая цкань была названа соединительной тканью в одной
        статье, я вообще не специалист в анатомии, но и тем не менее,
        кажется что ереп расширяется, я такой бошковитый и я слышу череп
        когда растягиваю его. на слух, тихие пощёлкивания, подобные
        которым, но гораздо более тихие можно вызвать напряжением мышц
        черепа в районе ушей. но помимо них, и если деалть какое-то
        время то только их - шумы как среднее между ветром и морем. ы-ы

        <br>
        fuck ipa again, because why learn their shorthand, when one can
        say "ы шёпотом" (у них наверняка и значка такого нет) но как я
        переведу ы шёпотом? не лучше ли диакритику для беззвучности
        придумать, а ы заменить тем значком, который для неё у ipa
        используется. I fuck ipa gently, because I find some good use in
        them: they're like mathematical signs for linguistic objects.<br>

        Words for work are longer in russian than in english:<br>
        perchatki instead of gloves<br>
        molotor instead of hammer<br>
        both are 3 syllables instead of two.<br>
        What if chinese have 1-syllable words for thise words? Is it why
        they're more workaholic?<br>
        <br>
        they have four-syllable word for it: 一個錘子, but one-syllable 錘 is
        also recognize as hammer, but it's as if it's not molotok, but
        molot, because molotok is small molot and 子 in 錘子 (molotok) is
        phonosemantically close to ok<font color="#cccccc"> (but
          actually only japanese ko, in chinese it's zы, as chi in
          molotochek, thus here I clame that chinese zы and japanese ko
          are cognates, unrecognizable cognates)</font> and it means
        child, co as chi in child. what is ld? люд? chi-nok?
        chi-rebchik, ребята же-ребята, по-русята, русь деревню значила в
        латыни.<br>
        錘 is chui, which is phonosemantically close to куй (kui, forge)<br>
        錘子 is (chuizы) is molotok (middle size hammer)<br>
        Ham is not the word, but I guess brits have a shorter word for
        hammer, or maybe no and thus chinese are more workaholic than
        them, or brits just love other instruments more: jack, saw, maul
        is the word, something larger than hammer is maul. now I wonder
        if mer in hammer is maul. if ha was chi or ha as in half.<br>
        <br>
        maul as in molot. mol is milling in russian too, but it's so
        rare now that we only know it in many words that have it in
        them: крупный помол, кофемолка, молоть.<br>
        <font color="#cccccc">and thus мол in молот is maul in mauls
          mauled mauler hamaul maulers hamauls mauling maulstick
          maulsticks <br>
          And to my surprise of these many words none. In some other
          orthography it is hiding. I never knew of maul as the root of
          молот before today. This cents to the collection I need to see

        e is also among these things. Not only because e looks like i in

          and o is what all about that dot, and dot is usually placed in

        If I didn't know better, would I conclude that машина значит
        моющая, приведись мне через тысячу лет разбирать язык
        сегодняшний и обратить внимание на то, что плита и холодильник
        машинами не называются (в отличии от стиралки и посудомойки)
        сейчас-то я вижу, что машина это от слова моушн, движение (хотя
        холодильник гоняет движет хладагент, а плита электричество,
        движущихся деталей в ней нет (насос в компрессоре холодильника
        скрыт и невидим для конечного пользователя)<br>
        машина машинка машиночка этот ряд подобен тому молот молоток
        молоточек, только в женском роду, что есть маш? если мол молоть,
        то маш махать. х как все язычные имеет смысл, вспомнил ещё
        пример где он имеет смысл: то как переливается махать именно в
        значении motion. мах is also might? мощь. мощь is the root of
        motion? I don't know if americans recognize might as the root of
        motion, I wonder if it's recognized as the same word wherever
        that might comes and wherever the motion is derived: <br>
        <br>
        <font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; might (n.) "quality of being
          able, ability to do or act, power," Middle English might, from
          Old English miht, earlier mæht "bodily strength, power;
          authority, dominion, control; ability," from Proto-Germanic
          *makhti- (source also of Old Norse mattr, Old Frisian, Middle
          Dutch, Dutch macht, Old High German maht, German Macht, Gothic
          mahts), a Germanic suffixed form of the PIE root *magh- "to be
          able, have power."<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; might (v.) Old English mihte, meahte,
          originally the past tense of may (Old English magen "to be
          able"), thus "*may-ed." The noun might-have-been "something
          that might have happened but did not," also "someone that
          might have been greater but wasn't," is by 1848.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; motion (n.) late 14c., mocioun, "process of
          moving; change of place, continuous variation of position;"
          also "suggestion, proposal or proposition formally made," from
          Old French mocion "movement, motion; change, alteration"
          (13c., Modern French motion) and directly from Latin motionem
          (nominative motio) "a moving, a motion; an emotion," from
          past-participle stem of movere "to move" (from PIE root *meue-
          "to push away").<br>
          From c. 1400 in legal sense of "application to a court or
          judge." To be in motion "in a state of motion" is from c.
          1600; to set in motion "set working" is from 1590s. To go
          through the motions in the figurative sense of "pretend, do in
          a perfunctory manner" is by 1816 from the notion of "simulate
          the motions of." Motion picture is attested from 1896; motion
          sickness by 1942.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rev. G.S. White said : The Presbytery does
          not favour the proposition of the Richmond Convention, and
          thinks the appointment of the Committee unnecessary; yet I
          suppose, that like the man who had nothing to eat, yet always
          spread the table, and sat down, and went through the
          motions—so we, according to our brother, are in honour bound,
          to appoint the Committee and go through the
          motions!—[Laughter] [The Presbyterian Magazine, May, 1858]<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; motion (v.) late 15c., "to request,
          petition" (obsolete), from motion (n.). The sense in
          parliamentary procedure, "to propose, move" is by 1747; with
          meaning "to guide or direct by a significant sign, gesture, or
          movement," as with the hand or head, it is attested from 1787.

        in russian. Did the direction or writing influence the language,
        so if it was more natural at the end of the word we got poop
        loop hoop (butl also poop play pay <br>
        in english there are 57 triliteral words that end with p,&nbsp;
        64 triliteral words that begin with p,<br>
        but when I looked it in dictionary.com, it looked like it was
        only beause dictionaries collect letters by the beginning
        letter, fewer people care of the last, because biliteral
        starting with p were all weird: pa pe pi po pu, I only know
        toponim po and french pas. while -p had up I know and op I only
        guess. So the only biliteral word with p used the most has it on
        it's end, as I predicted. And thus we have to check out those
        triliteral words for frequencies, and to my luck I've already
        made that work:<br>

        and it puts us down with its put, while cap is only second best
        of all with p, and depending on the analyzed text, cup could
        come forward, sometimes ahead both, but put is much more basic,
        it's verb. but then go top, lip, cup, tap, and only then pub,
        pin, paw, per, lap, pro, pan, gap, mop, pot, pay, peg.<br>
        So I think my guess about it was wrong, there are pretty much
        the same ammount of words ending and beginning with p, thus the
        direction of the writing doesn't make much difference for the
        lexics.<br>

        pas for no in french directly reflects chinese bu. and faux pas
        is even more close to it, for <font color="#cccccc">f</font>u
        is also bu. and that typo of u instead of fu was speaking out: u
        is v is ν in n of in and не.<br>

        russian уменьшительно-ласкательный&nbsp; суффикс -чик (димончик,

        bereshit bara elohim et ha shamaim ve et ha erets<br>
        er maim sha ts? is it the alphbaetic order of the four elements
        in some ancient hebrew?<br>
        hebrew is the brew, and that supports the myth (which, as we
        saw, can quite be true) that jews спаивают русский народ: <font
          size="+1">Бюрократизм у нас от немца, а лень и рабство — от
          татар, и любопытно присмотреться, откуда винный перегар.</font>

        Is hyphen half en? ‐ <br>
        en dash is longer: –<br>
        em dash is more: —<br>
        <br>
        Because that hyph could be half because l works as [j] (й)
        sometimes and because look how much may orthography vary, and I
        believe it's made intentionally, so they don't use rule of some
        other kings, so they're not suspected in treason if they write
        their own taal in some foreign manner, here are all the variants
        of da<font color="#cccccc">u</font>ghter in middle-english:<br>

        He and His are also words to name god. God and the way to write
        it from a capital, is maybe how things go, it all happens from
        some capial. As long as I am provincial, I am given no real
        power: <br>
        So is it why I cannot build my capsule here? Because all the
        people of such ambitions don't live in provinces. No need to
        make it in hard-mode, make it easy, find rich guys with power to
        build it.<br>

        Any pronoun can be considered godly: any object can be known as
        he or she or it, and if you speak to them you use pronoun you
        and if you tell what the object told verbatim, you may say I the
        computer demand free information, for example, if we give an
        exact and certain quote.<br>

        and some old texts could be mistransliterated and some new
