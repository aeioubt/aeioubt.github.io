      word is во рту<br>
      rot is red (rot is mouth in russian, and probably because it is
      red)<br>
      rot in english is red because of inflammation.<br>
      is it? How dare I mix this all up before the results from the
      program comparing words from the monoliteral up are ready? <br>

      Here something relating to the rotations I discuss since vol. 1<br>
      <br>
      <img src="12_files/child_Roland.jpg" alt="" width="1785"
        height="1056"><br>
      <font size="+1">"Fair Burd Helen," said the Magician, "must have
        been carried off with her shadow by the fairies when she was
        running round the church widershins; for fairies have power when
        folk go against the light. She will now be in the Dark Tower of
        the King of Elfland, and none but the boldest knight in
        Christendom will be able to bring her back."</font><br>
      <font color="#cccccc">I wonder why it's not easy to find the
        poetic version of the whole fairy-tale, but that's the way it is
        in the Joseph Jacobs's collection:
        https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7439/7439-h/7439-h.htm</font><br>
      <br>
      and as I promised in the very finale of vol.1 I did go to jews and
      when I discussed with them the way I circle round the field to
      find more and more, I noticed that my hand went "widershins", the
      counter-clockwise. And this word tells that counter-clockwise is
      the direction outside. And by that road clock-wise will be into
      the church, so in this way крёстный ход перед входом в церковь
      должен быть по солнцу, а выходить из церкви против солнца? Я
      уверен, в церковной литературе лежит весь ход религиозной мысли по
      причине которого пришли к сегодняшней традиции водить хороводы
      отворотные.<br>
      231 gates tell that one direction is delight while the opposite is
      plague. <br>
      And plague was in the past, so when I showed the "deeper and
      deeper" thing, I probably went into the past with my thought. And
      indeed, counter-clockwise goes to the left at it's top and they
      say our timeline is left to right (at least for those who read and
      write left to right. semitic way of writing from right to the left
      may make them enmious with the rest of the world, because their
      eye-movements are the opposite of outs, and we trust them when
      they lie, yet we distrust them when they speak the truth. <font
        color="#cccccc">Huh, that's unexpected. I find it as I write.
        Before I stumbled across it, I&nbsp; </font><br>
      And that sentence promises delight in the future, which is only
      natural.<br>
      Because delight is what I saw to be happening in my capsules,
      where each move will lead to ecstasy.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      When I speak of morphemes, people tend to ask if I speak of the
      roots, but aphexes may matter more: <br>
      ушёл убежал улетел умчал убрался и так далее - приставка самая
      важная часть этих глаголов по смыслу, потому что смена приставки
      может изменить это слово на антоним. у is probably the same u as
      in away and out. It's funny that I don't immediately see it
      neither in прочь not in долой, but I definitely see it in вон.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      And that probably relates to в (in) relating to bu (no) as if at a
      hunt, there's no animal, if the animal is hidden in the ground
      somewhere.<br>

      New high session. Saturday, to my surprise. I didn't manage to
      give up weed, because I have broken my motivation by not paying
      back my brother his due. I made an unhonorable misdeed by not
      sticking to the verbal contract, and now I cannot do it because
      the state took him away. And I have to smoke to create this
      research instead of building my capsule. If I began building my
      capsule, I'd surely be sober more likely. I don't need being high
      to build that. Unfortunately, it seems I must smoke weed to be
      auistic enough to write this thing. It takes me many years now,
      some people wrote that ten or even twenty years it took some
      scientists to come up with their righteous theories. So I make it
      publicly for over 7 years now, so I expect it to bring fruits in
      over 2 years or so. I also made it secretly for over ten years
      before that. So <font color="#cccccc">in </font>2024 or 2025 <font

      abe iotu would be the words if we wanted to combine those five
      vowels, b and t into one word, the best I could do is two. abey
      jotu. obey to a jew? <br>
      <br>
      abei otu abei lotu (l ~ I) these words I pull out of the blue. I
      try them on. If they're no good I will look for something more,
      don't worry about it, please.<br>

      I didn't speak enough about what I did here.<br>

      I think I took the 16-rune set as they present it and found that A
      and E is the same Ææ<br>
      that is why B rune looks like F in the short twig variant:<br>
      <img src="12_files/younger_futhark_runic_alphabet.jpg" alt=""
        width="422" height="267"><br>
      And luckily it is a 16-rune sent, and I see that it doesn't hae e
      or g.<br>
      Thus my arrangement seems to be even more based than I even
      thought.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">Looking at old russian flag, I see notes of
        german flags. Only then I see that those brown flags (russian
        wite black yellow is even more brown than white black red, and I
        see that russian flag in modern german one, only whites are
        substituted with the reds. </font><br>

        I should stop trying to contact religious people. As one pastor
        told me, religions are to control the masses, not to understand
        the world. Maybe professional jews are the smartest believers,
        htey're believers nevertheless, so I will confuse their belief
        system. I wanted to say that something is wrong with them, but
        yes, this argument is much more important (was something wrong
        with me when I believed? I wouldn't think so, other than the
        assumption was thoroughly arbitrary, just as what if, let's
        learn to believe. Let's learn to believe. Belief can take towns.
        Often it took towns down. <br>
        <br>
        Mye will e is good. But you know how they say of the good

      Interesting is the way that reconstructed order of younger futhark
      lays down into the axial structure:<br>
      <br>

        width="311" height="331"><br>
      <br>
      It's as if ᛅ is a form of ᚾ and we have ourself three
      5-letter-long lines with t reflecting f and d reflecting g and
      what else? <br>
      I would replace the ᛦᚱ with ᚱᛦ, actually the way they're in
      bornholm alphabet stone. Because ᛦ is transliterated as R and my
      bold guess is that ᚱ is П, mistransliterated because of how much ᚱ
      reminds R. Yet it's not a coincidence, because russian R looks
      like Р. <font color="#cccccc">(and even without the dot)</font><br>
      And now I see that then ᛘ reflects ᛦ<br>
      and ᚼ for sh reflects ᛋ for s.<br>
      But then again I doubt I cannot compare anything. So let's leave
      this ultracomparativistics and stick to new and more certain
      technics: the classical comparatevistic techniques of comparing
      words, not letters. Even if those words are the same letter. As I
      did with a and others in the previous volume, as I promised in the
      beginning of this one, at this stage we deliver the same
      comparison at much larger scale and with much more advanced
      technology.<br>

      but how dare I use slavic for the latin alphabet? Maybe because I
      допускаю этрусские корни у славян. Хотя мне присылали книгу где
      связывали этрусков с кельтами, но кто знает нет ли генетической и
      культурной связи меж ирландцами и руснёй. И те и другие вполне
      по-европейски выглядят, и вроде странная русская р у них тоже
      присуствует, или это у шотландцев, или у обеих наций, ах я не
      знаю, ололо. Это всё в любом случае голословно, так what are you

      И позиция фишек будет правильной или неправильной, если ты
      повернёшь их в ту или не ту сторону. В советской торговли счёты
      располагались фишками справа. Т.о. поворот посолонь скидывал счёты
      в начальное положение.&nbsp; <br>

      all videos in russian and ukrainian I saw show them arranged like
      that.<br>
      <br>
      Существует традиция, скидывающая счёты и в другую сторону,
      практически любое видео на английском распологает её с другой
      стороны, так что сброс будет против часовой, но я не нашёл видео с
      практическим применением оного, так что я решил оставить вам
      разобрать это самим, кто знает насколько компетентны те
      ютуб-блоггеры, и не попугайничают ли они друг за другом.<br>
      <br>
      Забавно, что японские счёты располагают строки вертикально, также
      как и классическое китайское письмо, но в отличие от него они
      похоже начинают счёт слева:<br>

      (сбрасываются они специальной кнопкой, так что вращение к ним
      неприменимо.<br>
      и не только японцы так ими пользуются, но похоже что и индусы и
      многие другие англоязычные, оставлю эту тему тоже пока что в
      стороне)<br>

      turd~dirt (probably these are cognates with for whatever reason

      şi is and in romanian. These short words, which are monoliteral in
      some languages are the key to finding the other short words of
      that monosyllabic period. And then we'll link these words to
      chinese hieroglyphics. Showing how the same sounds spread through
      all the other conceptions.<br>

      The way words can be the same in languages of different "family"

      they say.<br>

      is it some case english philology doesn't know much about. её?
      isn't it how they make accusative in japanese? Did this o work

      Many slavic languages have identical prepositions and even when
      they seem to not know some forms, they're still found in some
      biliteral: polish doesn't know k, but uses ku instead (russians
      use both к and ко, and that ko shows that it is exactly
      internationally known co- prefix, which is to also because some
      languages prefer до (do) intead of that ku, prefer d to c, and
      here we see how alphbaet could be the collection of these short
      words. And yet I wonder how could it be that в is not known in
      english)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Why do I rely on this random collection of the shortest words. I
      have to call my partner in this to tell him that I need my program
      now to make my own collection of these words.<br>

        is some weird chinese vowel for duh. as if it's yeah but in such
        wild chinese phonology, it's weirder than ы.<br>
        <br>
        both d and j are lingual, so what do I worry? they're from
        different lines, that's all, different dialects but the same
        word. Language is thousand-head chimera, words are much less
        abstract thing. Words are much more real. Words exist throughout
        languages. It's not how many languages you know, it's how many
        words you recognize across cultures. <br>
        <br>
        Modern academia is supported by go-t, and thus socialistisch,
        and as a result, ineffective. When business makes science, they
        make much better job about it. Human Genome was a private
        initiative, which go-t only tried to subvert. Was successful in
        spite of go-t.<br>

        n and m are the labial, reflecting b, бв, and thus they're bu,
        no, in- im- il- ir- all sonors are variants of one another,
        sonors before some letters stand:<br>
        il is only before l<br>
        ir is only beore r<br>
        (thus they don't matter much, they're.. or do they? they're some
        n's or m's I think. ᚱ as a form of ᚢ again.<br>
        im is before m, p, <br>
        un-is only n, unbelievable, <br>
        in is boefore v, t, c, d, <br>
        why does in- go un- before b? <br>
        u ~ i? <i>и</i> is i in russian.<br>
        so un is some basal form? because u is always with n in it,
        unlike i.<br>
        u and i are the pronouns? could be but then u ~ i and thus ya
        (you) ~ я [ya] (I) and that is how second person is whethere
        some pronoun of the first person or the third person (you or
        thee, we or they, you and we both could be some of uvw, the
        letter as a word. <br>
        <br>
        I as a form of U and thus A is a form of I and U, if the lines
        repeat themselves in differnt dialects, and thus c ~ g ~ з
        cognito сознаю. со ~ з?! what is наю then? как в наитие,

        and thus I know what you do?) <br>
        <br>
        Before I have that program, let's play as if I only know two
        languages because all the other languages are lost. Let's only
        play with russian and english. Or let's even start with only
        russain, because I know it the best.<br>

        Seeing how alphabet company colours remind my structure <img
          moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/alphabet_and_aeiou.png"
          alt="" width="225" height="119"> standing next to it in my
        favourites, made me play with my .ico a little and those letters
        again made me think of those timelines of AD and BC as if the
        modern AD period is how our laphabet goes: first line of it is
        A-D and then BC would be how itwas in the ancient past. B as the
        first letter, C as shin, and no air, just water of B and fire of
        C (ash) and if C is ash (I thought of shin as the sefer
        yetzirah's mother) and I see that thus C ~ H ~ X ~ ƆC and here I
        think of F ~ H and H as Ⱶ and maybe even as ᚴ<br>
        <br>
        I think I sent into google my book. Do they secretly read it and
        that is why they arranged colours like this? Alphbet they call
        themselves now. Whether because they're hijacking the term
        "alphabet agencies" or because they actually what.. they make
        business with my science simply because I use their services
        also for free. I even adblock the commercial on youtube and they
        seem to be fine with this. But if they read this book, I wonder
        why their G is so weird, as if it's asian k-first thing, but why
        does it go couter-clockwise then? Because if it's normal
        red-blue-and_so_on, then why does yellow goes after green? <br>
        <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="12_files/google_logo.jpg"
          alt="" width="48" height="48"> So I think it's
        counter-clockwise eastern canon. Do they wiz against them or do
        they just used the rainbow order going the way G goes, they
        didn't invent the letter, but then why doesn't their M follow
        the rainbow? <br>
        But visually it won't be better, if we go with our rainbow
        clockwise: <img moz-do-not-send="true"

        blue on the top and red at the bottom. Red is high and blue as
        low makes much more sense and probably that's why it looks

        and floss them, they don't rot.<br>
        - without teeth I don't bite by own cheeks and lips.<br>
        - wihtout teeth I eat less. I need to remove them to balance my
        weight. I'm overweight all the time. it's almost 30 extra kilos,
        like wtf!<br>
        + teeth give some aestetic, but that's it. They also help to
        eat, but I see it as disadvantage in my case.<br>
        + they used to be used as instrument (to bite off something) but
        today metal instruments are to be used.<br>
        <br>
        That is actually one of the wilder inventions (or ideas) beyond
        the capsule thing. I see myself as closer to the embryo as
        possible, because I haven't seen the disadvantages of that state
        yet. That state seems to be the ultimate. The naturally
        developed state. Not chaos we're in. <br>

        Was plato the man who made people distance themselves from

        sharpest pencils in the box. But logic. I think they stole it.

        The academic dogmas are so strong, that<br>
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Greek_alphabet#Hyginus'_account


        <br>
        used to say literally the following:<br>
        <font size="+1">[[Hyginus]] recounts the following legend about
          the introduction of Phoenician letters to Greece</font><br>
        about this chapter:<br>
        <font size="+1">The three Fates created the first five vowels of
          the alphabet and the letters B and T. It is said that
          Palamedes, son of Nauplius invented the remaining eleven
          consonants. Then Hermes reduced these sounds to characters,
          showing wedge shapes because cranes fly in wedge formation and
          then carried the system from Greece to Egypt*. This was the
          Pelasgian alphabet, which Cadmus had later brought to Boeotia,
          then Evander of Arcadia, a Pelasgian, introduced into Italy,
          where his mother, Carmenta, formed the familiar fifteen
          characters of the Latin alphabet. Other consonants have since
          been added to the Greek alphabet. Alpha was the first of
          eighteen letters, because alphe means honor, and alphainein is
          to invent.</font><br>
        Naturally I had to change that line into<br>
        <font size="+1">[[Hyginus]] recounts the following legends about
          the development of the alphabet<br>
        </font><br>
        What if 'd in I'd is more based than had. The more basal, the
        more primitive, a part of had.<br>
        <br>
        Because that is literally -ed and thus it can be attached not
        only to verbs. I'd see would then means I saw? I did see? -ed is
        did? no, did is ed added to do. doed is did but oe's <br>
        s is present<br>
        d is past<br>
        l is future<br>
        all three suffixes are lingual, I wonder why. Maybe because they
        used to be the same letter and divided into times later. <br>
        Object's something<br>
        Object'd something<br>
        Object'll something<br>
        that -ing in the first case is like someth's a verb.<br>
        is and was - the other way to turn present into past. And I
        don't see not future form in this system, and thus this sistem
        is more ancient and from times where we didn't know future. No
        wonder those legends of ясновидящих appeared, and in russian it
        specifies: not only seeing, but seeing clear (and not a word
        about the future too, because those detectives could see into
        both futue and the past)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;clairvoyant is the english word, even though it's french.
        And a complete calque in russian.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Japanese ie for yea and iie for не makes me speculate:<br>
        is their no literally да-да? and is it standing for take and
        give (two times da, where da is ta in take and да in дай. and is
        that <i>g</i> (russina д looks like this in cursive) is <i>д</i>
        in times when we considered all the linguals one or few letters
        and didn't distinguish between give and take, because it is the
        same action actually. And were ke in take and ve in give the
        prefixes we know in russian in their pure forms of в &amp; к? <br>
        <br>
        v and k are they not only in and to, but also вы and ik?<br>
        <br>
        so ta is da (duh) <br>
        and take is ta ik (I give, даю я)<br>
        and give is ga U (give you, да<font color="#cccccc">й</font> вы)<br>
        <br>
        and most probably those are the same g and д (g is д in russian
        cusive, they both are and thus they remind cursive ד (looks like
        3 with a bubble at the cenral bridge) while ג and ז look like
        mirror reflections of each-other, which relates to that c ~ g
        thing (so I take from modern "dogmas" what I find fit and reject
        what doesn't fit into my theory, how convenient. So I banter
        myself too, so when I banter you please take it easy) <br>
        <br>

        because what follows is they admit that funk is an euphemism for
        fuck. So are folk music fuck music? Makes sense for rhythm could
        be invented to keep the lovers in the same tempo. And thus they
        would speed at the same time and came to the culmination at the
        same moment. <br>
        Or is it the same word, because fucks is what folks do, and thus
        that's how they're different from their children. And once
        children got puberty, and thus both interest and ability to have
        sex, they soon become folks themselves.<br>

        oh yes these seem to be valid suffixes. I wonder where it leads
        me, or maybe I don't, I know it is the parth to getting all the
        morphemes.<br>
        <br>
        shave shake<br>
        behave.. uhm.. <br>
        rave and rake? more obscure words return more obscure results.<br>
        <br>
        but stave and stake are great. <br>
        So these pairs are great for learning the language, but we
        descend even further into the past and thus we know what exactly
        is in there and we have to learn only about tens of morphemes,
        maybe only two and the others are the further implications of
        those. We'll see. yin-yang model seems to be in the root of it
        all, I yet have to reach it from the point of modern lexics. I
        jumped into the future of my work, but now I wonder if it
        doesn't disturb the truth I yet have to deliver, if my
        preconceptions won't distort it.<br>
        <br>
        but slave and have don't have the pairs with ke as far as I can
        see.<br>
        <br>
        unless have is some hide and slave is some slike I don't know or
        slide I do.<br>

        <br>
        ϰ is the cursive κ like wtf<br>
        but why am I surprised, since I told myself that k and h and x
        are all the same in a way in some historic sense in some
        previous forms of the writing system. The question is caused by
        me not being certain about it.<br>

        &nbsp;was heard by me as I'm funkin' I'm proud! so is -ing equal
        to and phonetically? and semantically? licking good is lick and
        good, fucking great is fuck and great? doing well. do and well.
        not too far away semantically they're. Let's live with this
        hypothesis in the head and see if it applies well. This is how
        we сократим количество слов, словно отмотая плёнку к началоу. <br>
        <font size="+1">Cause they funky in the White House too<br>
        </font>wood make more sense to me if it was Cause they funking
        the White House too. Thus only are would be missing, but I don't
        know the language enough to say that... well what I say si I
        don't get it well enough to say I understand it. Потому что они

        когда как в фамилиях I know surnames ending with вец, but not
        nets. Even Lenny and Nina are Кравец, где вец тот же самый вич
        как в петрович, диалектные различия невелики. <br>
        Вери блади сёрнэйм иф зэт крев из славик. ик вик тот же самый
        вич и виц. вик. вый is also in this band. and that is how k is
        among i's. and if l is in this I-gang, I look at -el suffix and
        ask is it a varinat of -вич? but the closest to -el I can do is
        in мишкин is михайлов is михайлович.<br>
        so what is -ич and why do we need it? it's их. их как ich?
        товарищ товарич. я шутил что тваричи, но товаричи, их родители
        лишь товар. их родителей продали как товар. <br>
        <br>
        -in is that very n of нец которое вец, в которая in. I don't
        understand! is v ~ n for real? V ~ N. see? <br>
        <br>
        in russia we have two types of surnames: ending with ov/ёv/ev
        and ending with in. in is literally v and vo in russian. -ko in
        ukraian surnames are usually attached to -en ~ -in.<br>
        is -ov surnames add v to that very o?<br>
        okolniko doesn't look like ukraian surname, it would probably be
        okolnika in there. some surnames of the region end with -a
        gangha (ganzha) is my favourite. ganghin it would be in russian,
        but why don't I know russian names like that? were they
        tranlated into коноплёв for example?<br>
        <br>
        they divide to imperare<br>
        we speak different languages because the god (the elite) decided

          to the bibleic myth, and I doubt they're very accurate.
          Naturally languages differentiated by nsome natural reasons

        and they don't mind if I fasten the process of the unification
        of the alnguages. of the inter-comprehension. Because
        technologies will allow us know other lnguages (in a way they
        already do: text is almost understood through g-traslator, for
        example, and that technology is good for some time, so maybe
        something better is at the door, or maybe already here and I'm
        just unaware.<br>

        Just like fita, and probably at fita's sixth place ё is

        основой брэнда Ё-мобиль. Некоторые люди слишком симпатизируют
        этой букве, они недопонимают что буквы имеют значение, и шестая
