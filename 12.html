      word is во рту<br>
      rot is red (rot is mouth in russian, and probably because it is
      red)<br>
      rot in english is red because of inflammation.<br>
      is it? How dare I mix this all up before the results from the
      program comparing words from the monoliteral up are ready? <br>

      Here something relating to the rotations I discuss since vol. 1<br>
      <br>
      <img src="12_files/child_Roland.jpg" alt="" width="1785"
        height="1056"><br>
      <font size="+1">"Fair Burd Helen," said the Magician, "must have
        been carried off with her shadow by the fairies when she was
        running round the church widershins; for fairies have power when
        folk go against the light. She will now be in the Dark Tower of
        the King of Elfland, and none but the boldest knight in
        Christendom will be able to bring her back."</font><br>
      <font color="#cccccc">I wonder why it's not easy to find the
        poetic version of the whole fairy-tale, but that's the way it is
        in the Joseph Jacobs's collection:
        https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7439/7439-h/7439-h.htm</font><br>
      <br>
      and as I promised in the very finale of vol.1 I did go to jews and
      when I discussed with them the way I circle round the field to
      find more and more, I noticed that my hand went "widershins", the
      counter-clockwise. And this word tells that counter-clockwise is
      the direction outside. And by that road clock-wise will be into
      the church, so in this way крёстный ход перед входом в церковь
      должен быть по солнцу, а выходить из церкви против солнца? Я
      уверен, в церковной литературе лежит весь ход религиозной мысли по
      причине которого пришли к сегодняшней традиции водить хороводы
      отворотные.<br>
      231 gates tell that one direction is delight while the opposite is
      plague. <br>
      And plague was in the past, so when I showed the "deeper and
      deeper" thing, I probably went into the past with my thought. And
      indeed, counter-clockwise goes to the left at it's top and they
      say our timeline is left to right (at least for those who read and
      write left to right. semitic way of writing from right to the left
      may make them enmious with the rest of the world, because their
      eye-movements are the opposite of outs, and we trust them when
      they lie, yet we distrust them when they speak the truth. <font
        color="#cccccc">Huh, that's unexpected. I find it as I write.
        Before I stumbled across it, I&nbsp; </font><br>
      And that sentence promises delight in the future, which is only
      natural.<br>
      Because delight is what I saw to be happening in my capsules,
      where each move will lead to ecstasy.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      When I speak of morphemes, people tend to ask if I speak of the
      roots, but aphexes may matter more: <br>
      ушёл убежал улетел умчал убрался и так далее - приставка самая
      важная часть этих глаголов по смыслу, потому что смена приставки
      может изменить это слово на антоним. у is probably the same u as
      in away and out. It's funny that I don't immediately see it
      neither in прочь not in долой, but I definitely see it in вон.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      And that probably relates to в (in) relating to bu (no) as if at a
      hunt, there's no animal, if the animal is hidden in the ground
      somewhere.<br>

      New high session. Saturday, to my surprise. I didn't manage to
      give up weed, because I have broken my motivation by not paying
      back my brother his due. I made an unhonorable misdeed by not
      sticking to the verbal contract, and now I cannot do it because
      the state took him away. And I have to smoke to create this
      research instead of building my capsule. If I began building my
      capsule, I'd surely be sober more likely. I don't need being high
      to build that. Unfortunately, it seems I must smoke weed to be
      auistic enough to write this thing. It takes me many years now,
      some people wrote that ten or even twenty years it took some
      scientists to come up with their righteous theories. So I make it
      publicly for over 7 years now, so I expect it to bring fruits in
      over 2 years or so. I also made it secretly for over ten years
      before that. So <font color="#cccccc">in </font>2024 or 2025 <font

      abe iotu would be the words if we wanted to combine those five
      vowels, b and t into one word, the best I could do is two. abey
      jotu. obey to a jew? <br>
      <br>
      abei otu abei lotu (l ~ I) these words I pull out of the blue. I
      try them on. If they're no good I will look for something more,
      don't worry about it, please.<br>

      I didn't speak enough about what I did here.<br>

      I think I took the 16-rune set as they present it and found that A
      and E is the same Ææ<br>
      that is why B rune looks like F in the short twig variant:<br>
      <img src="12_files/younger_futhark_runic_alphabet.jpg" alt=""
        width="422" height="267"><br>
      And luckily it is a 16-rune sent, and I see that it doesn't hae e
      or g.<br>
      Thus my arrangement seems to be even more based than I even
      thought.<br>
      <br>

      <font color="#cccccc">Looking at old russian flag, I see notes of
        german flags. Only then I see that those brown flags (russian
        wite black yellow is even more brown than white black red, and I
        see that russian flag in modern german one, only whites are
        substituted with the reds. </font><br>

        I should stop trying to contact religious people. As one pastor
        told me, religions are to control the masses, not to understand
        the world. Maybe professional jews are the smartest believers,
        htey're believers nevertheless, so I will confuse their belief
        system. I wanted to say that something is wrong with them, but
        yes, this argument is much more important (was something wrong
        with me when I believed? I wouldn't think so, other than the
        assumption was thoroughly arbitrary, just as what if, let's
        learn to believe. Let's learn to believe. Belief can take towns.
        Often it took towns down. <br>
        <br>
        Mye will e is good. But you know how they say of the good

      Interesting is the way that reconstructed order of younger futhark
      lays down into the axial structure:<br>
      <br>

        width="311" height="331"><br>
      <br>
      It's as if ᛅ is a form of ᚾ and we have ourself three
      5-letter-long lines with t reflecting f and d reflecting g and
      what else? <br>
      I would replace the ᛦᚱ with ᚱᛦ, actually the way they're in
      bornholm alphabet stone. Because ᛦ is transliterated as R and my
      bold guess is that ᚱ is П, mistransliterated because of how much ᚱ
      reminds R. Yet it's not a coincidence, because russian R looks
      like Р. <font color="#cccccc">(and even without the dot)</font><br>
      And now I see that then ᛘ reflects ᛦ<br>
      and ᚼ for sh reflects ᛋ for s.<br>
      But then again I doubt I cannot compare anything. So let's leave
      this ultracomparativistics and stick to new and more certain
      technics: the classical comparatevistic techniques of comparing
      words, not letters. Even if those words are the same letter. As I
      did with a and others in the previous volume, as I promised in the
      beginning of this one, at this stage we deliver the same
      comparison at much larger scale and with much more advanced
      technology.<br>

      but how dare I use slavic for the latin alphabet? Maybe because I
      допускаю этрусские корни у славян. Хотя мне присылали книгу где
      связывали этрусков с кельтами, но кто знает нет ли генетической и
      культурной связи меж ирландцами и руснёй. И те и другие вполне
      по-европейски выглядят, и вроде странная русская р у них тоже
      присуствует, или это у шотландцев, или у обеих наций, ах я не
      знаю, ололо. Это всё в любом случае голословно, так what are you

      И позиция фишек будет правильной или неправильной, если ты
      повернёшь их в ту или не ту сторону. В советской торговли счёты
      располагались фишками справа. Т.о. поворот посолонь скидывал счёты
      в начальное положение.&nbsp; <br>

      all videos in russian and ukrainian I saw show them arranged like
      that.<br>
      <br>
      Существует традиция, скидывающая счёты и в другую сторону,
      практически любое видео на английском распологает её с другой
      стороны, так что сброс будет против часовой, но я не нашёл видео с
      практическим применением оного, так что я решил оставить вам
      разобрать это самим, кто знает насколько компетентны те
      ютуб-блоггеры, и не попугайничают ли они друг за другом.<br>
      <br>
      Забавно, что японские счёты располагают строки вертикально, также
      как и классическое китайское письмо, но в отличие от него они
      похоже начинают счёт слева:<br>

      (сбрасываются они специальной кнопкой, так что вращение к ним
      неприменимо.<br>
      и не только японцы так ими пользуются, но похоже что и индусы и
      многие другие англоязычные, оставлю эту тему тоже пока что в
      стороне)<br>

      turd~dirt (probably these are cognates with for whatever reason

      şi is and in romanian. These short words, which are monoliteral in
      some languages are the key to finding the other short words of
      that monosyllabic period. And then we'll link these words to
      chinese hieroglyphics. Showing how the same sounds spread through
      all the other conceptions.<br>

      The way words can be the same in languages of different "family"

      they say.<br>

      Many slavic languages have identical prepositions and even when
      they seem to not know some forms, they're still found in some
      biliteral: polish doesn't know k, but uses ku instead (russians
      use both к and ко, and that ko shows that it is exactly
      internationally known co- prefix, which is to also because some
      languages prefer до (do) intead of that ku, prefer d to c, and
      here we see how alphbaet could be the collection of these short
      words. And yet I wonder how could it be that в is not known in
      english)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Why do I rely on this random collection of the shortest words. I
      have to call my partner in this to tell him that I need my program
      now to make my own collection of these words.<br>
