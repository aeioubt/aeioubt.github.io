          But it would be too much to wait from unicode. I wish I could
          draw my own glyphs for and in the document. And if you think I
          say commies are a lucky ideology, you’re wrong again, fuck
          them big time, no matter what magic trick they implement on
          us, luck will not help them, because truth is what matters the
          most, and truth is not in their bs. But I shouldn't be too
          harsh on them, because russians did to conquered nations not
          sweeter things than commies did to us. <font color="#c0c0c0">but










            let's keep on wandering through this tabooed and yet vague

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here I notice that both ? and ʔ are
          lucky. and though swash on most letters is this way, f &amp; s
          are counter-clockwise. f&amp;s as in fascists? NaZi are both
          luckily turned. Was they smeared as fascist, even though they
          were nazi? <font color="#999999">natie is nation in
            netherlands and it sounds as nazi. probably same is true for
            german, but I still don't know german.</font> Is it because
          they were influenced and allied with italian fascists. Though
          what difference do these differences in naming does, if they
          were all the same? Even commies were not much different, and
          even more vicious towards the occupied population. Very epic
          villain as koschey bessmertny. <font color="#cccccc">and one
            of the founding fathers of вкп(б) was богданов, who
            experimented with blood to become immortal, and blood is the
            ancient key to immortality, and it could be the reason of
            many wars, where young blood can be sucked with no count.
            Infusion of young plasma is the key to immortality, drinking
            could be valid too. And though this knowledge can launch
            prices to this service to the sky, soon we'll not need it at
            all, for genetic therapies will make our blood young
            forever. Or maybe even artificial embryonic conditions with
            magic stretchings will be enough, but this is even less
            certain, for nobody seems to work in this direction, so I
            will have to build this experiment by myself.</font> I think
          they (russian governments were looking for national idea in
          our fairytails and saw that in the beginning Koschey governs,
          Ivans only supercede them. But in the very beginning there's
          three headed snake (russians have three crowns on their
          emblem, as if the central hat gives invisibility. Or was that
          head cut off by our tzar before he nailed it to his shield.
          Shield had to be of the size of the beast, so it saw itself in
          the polished metal and attacked himself, while somebody from
          its back cut the beast with a sword. but back to the nazis:<br>

        prepared for death. I’m pretty sure they’re the very same 100
        thousands workers hired by nazi government to build autobahnen.
        Whoever made them put unlucky swastika on those who oppose
        «them», had a wicked sense of humour, but very powerful, very
        powerful sense of humour, one of those things which let them
        live. and klezmer too, and you may call me degenerate, but I
        even find that director’s face rather nice.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t these swastikas also look like 666? My
        How none of these northern youth see that these swastikas can be
        read as bindrunes? sиx sиx sиx <font color="#cccccc">or sx sx
          sx or ss ss ss. S = C = 3? then G = 6, because it makes
          proto-alphabet 3 forms (3 fates, 3 mothers, see further) to 3
          forms of vowel, a i u (3rd person, 1st person, 2nd person – so
          I should have stand first? No, for some reason they avoided
          putting 123 in this order. Even abc seems to be 132, because
          even though in runes B &amp; D seem like 2 &amp; 1, when
          combined to “zero” of vowel, they rearanged and Ϩ looks like
          2, and 3 looks like B. and in sanskrit they go like this:
          first go set of vowels, then 4 dice of linguals (each die has
          one empty slot – like dominos have) then goes a die of labials
          and 9 additional letters (if they were used as numerals or not
          I don’t know, but they could.)</font><br>

        Don’t these swastikas look like 666? Then the opposite spell
        would be 777. if 666 is carbon, 777 is nitrogen, Lavoisier
        called it azote (literally “no life”) and russians call it like
        this, азот.&nbsp;Russians were the 777, I wanted to say, but I
        couldn’t find 3 hammer and sickle signs around that parade, what
        I found instead is this replay of that parade, and these three
        stars stand for 15 instead of 18, devil of tarot, not the
        lucifer of new testament:&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Making some moves with my arms, I noticed that one arm goes
        sunwards, the other one - counter-sunwards - so is it the reason
        they call those swasticas right and left. If you roll your arms
        like this, they are the same moves in relation to the axis of
        the body. And if you move left fist counter-clockwise, you move
        it to the left, and the right hand hits to it's right - it could
        be useful in sabre fight - probably those who twist those knives
        know this rule, though I yet have to check it.<br>
        And the image 卍卐 looks like an image of a man or an eagle or two
        brothers fighting back to back. When 卐卍 looks like two rivals,
        because right swastika is on the left and left swastika is on
        the right, thus they're halves of different men. Not only in
        sabre fight, but in rawing the boat it's important to know these
        directions. as in rowing a boat. Though it's weird to row
        backwards, it was determined by the muscles of our backs.<br>

                                third time. this probably relates to
                                snot, though I just figured it out,
                                nobody here doesn't now why we say that
                                other that лапшой rhymes with большой on
                                the fourth and further you'd have to
                                improvise</font>.<br>
                              <font color="#c0c0c0">Yet I don't know if
                                it was this way before commies, it quite
                                could be "господи благослови!" before
                                russian civil war (in which jews won) </font></font></font></span></span></font></font></font></font></span></span></font></font><font
        color="#c0c0c0"> – this&nbsp; phrase "gospodi blagoslovi!" is
        directly translated as "god bless!" and some people noticed that
        those english words look liek shortened russians: g-d is god and
        russian gospod, and bles could be a shorter form of blagos.
        Благой Господь, Blessed G-d. does ss go as г? boss бог the first
        example I got. (бог (bog) is god, where did brits got their
        meaning to that word who knows. it breathes, it eats)<br>
        if bless and blagos are indeed related, I'd suppose there a ה.
        bely ה ? bella dieu? beautiful woman, what men naturaly deify.
        what those christcucks burnt on sticks. Some women are witches,
        some of them are, and it's too much trouble trying to cure them
        with love, so people cured them with fire, and you know
        beautiful women are more likely to be raped and surviving these
        experiences getting more vicious. It could be quite a releaving
        experience, so this is how it is in the world, it made them
        cynicist, bitchy. uglier. угли. which fits this poem atm, but
        first I related ugly to углы (angles) both rhymes may be wrong
        ofc. </font><font color="#666666"><font color="#000000"><span

      upd:<br>
      <br>
      one benevolent witch taught me that swastikas are not lucky and
      unlucky, but male and female, I guess it's all yin-yang thing, and
      though sun goes sunwards, she told me to look at ursa m??or.<br>
      And she's right, northern <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmkDI5QO2o">sun</a> is on
      the south and goes rightwards, which is explicitly clockwise when
      it's high in the sky, while the northern <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vTMsCQ9RCs">sky</a>
      itself rotates counter-clockwise. I suppose sun is the man, while
      sky is shy, she, the one which embraces him in der himmel.<br>
