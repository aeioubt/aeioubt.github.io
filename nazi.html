          that hitler’s swastika was rotated 45 degrees. And it was
          rotated counter-solar, because it’s how it goes. <font

          But it would be too much to wait from unicode. I wish I could
          draw my own glyphs for and in the document. And if you think I
          say commies are a lucky ideology, you’re wrong again, fuck
          them big time, no matter what magic trick they implement on
          us, luck will not help them, because truth is what matters the
          most, and truth is not in their bs. But I shouldn't be too
          harsh on them, because russians did to conquered nations not
          sweeter things than commies did to us. <font color="#c0c0c0">but


            let's keep on wandering through this tabooed and yet vague
            theme.</font><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here I notice that both ? and ʔ are
          lucky. and though swash on most letters is this way, f &amp; s
          are counter-clockwise. f&amp;s as in fascists? NaZi are both
          luckily turned. Was they smeared as fascist, even though they
          were nazi? <font color="#999999">natie is nation in
            netherlands and it sounds as nazi. probably same is true for
            german, but I still don't know german.</font> Is it because
          they were influenced and allied with italian fascists. Though
          what difference do these differences in naming does, if they
          were all the same? Even commies were not much different, and
          even more vicious towards the occupied population. Very epic
          villain as koschey bessmertny. <font color="#cccccc">and one
            of the founding fathers of вкп(б) was богданов, who
            experimented with blood to become immortal, and blood is the
            ancient key to immortality, and it could be the reason of
            many wars, where young blood can be sucked with no count.
            Infusion of young plasma is the key to immortality, drinking
            could be valid too. And though this knowledge can launch
            prices to this service to the sky, soon we'll not need it at
            all, for genetic therapies will make our blood young
            forever. Or maybe even artificial embryonic conditions with
            magic stretchings will be enough, but this is even less
            certain, for nobody seems to work in this direction, so I
            will have to build this experiment by myself.</font> I think
          they (russian governments were looking for national idea in
          our fairytails and saw that in the beginning Koschey governs,
          Ivans only supercede them. But in the very beginning there's
          three headed snake (russians have three crowns on their
          emblem, as if the central hat gives invisibility. Or was that
          head cut off by our tzar before he nailed it to his shield.
          Shield had to be of the size of the beast, so it saw itself in
          the polished metal and attacked himself, while somebody from
          its back cut the beast with a sword. but back to the nazis:<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at all these jilted boys. All
        prepared for death. I’m pretty sure they’re the very same 100
        thousands workers hired by nazi government to build autobahnen.
        Whoever made them put unlucky swastika on those who oppose
        «them», had a wicked sense of humour, but very powerful, very
        powerful sense of humour, one of those things which let them
        live. and klezmer too, and you may call me degenerate, but I
        even find that director’s face rather nice.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t these swastikas also look like 666? My
        How none of these northern youth see that these swastikas can be
        read as bindrunes? sиx sиx sиx <font color="#cccccc">or sx sx
          sx or ss ss ss. S = C = 3? then G = 6, because it makes
          proto-alphabet 3 forms (3 fates, 3 mothers, see further) to 3
          forms of vowel, a i u (3rd person, 1st person, 2nd person – so
          I should have stand first? No, for some reason they avoided
          putting 123 in this order. Even abc seems to be 132, because
          even though in runes B &amp; D seem like 2 &amp; 1, when
          combined to “zero” of vowel, they rearanged and Ϩ looks like
          2, and 3 looks like B. and in sanskrit they go like this:
          first go set of vowels, then 4 dice of linguals (each die has
          one empty slot – like dominos have) then goes a die of labials
          and 9 additional letters (if they were used as numerals or not
          I don’t know, but they could.)</font><br>

        Don’t these swastikas look like 666? Then the opposite spell
        would be 777. if 666 is carbon, 777 is nitrogen, Lavoisier
        called it azote (literally “no life”) and russians call it like
        this, азот.&nbsp;Russians were the 777, I wanted to say, but I
        couldn’t find 3 hammer and sickle signs around that parade, what
        I found instead is this replay of that parade, and these three
        stars stand for 15 instead of 18, devil of tarot, not the
        lucifer of new testament:&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Making some moves with my arms, I noticed that one arm goes
        sunwards, the other one - counter-sunwards - so is it the reason
        they call those swasticas right and left. If you roll your arms
        like this, they are the same moves in relation to the axis of
        the body. And if you move left fist counter-clockwise, you move
        it to the left, and the right hand hits to it's right - it could
        be useful in sabre fight - probably those who twist those knives
        know this rule, though I yet have to check it.<br>
        And the image 卍卐 looks like an image of a man or an eagle or two
        brothers fighting back to back. When 卐卍 looks like two rivals,
        because right swastika is on the left and left swastika is on
        the right, thus they're halves of different men. Not only in
        sabre fight, but in rawing the boat it's important to know these
        directions. as in rowing a boat. Though it's weird to row
        backwards, it was determined by the muscles of our backs.<br>
