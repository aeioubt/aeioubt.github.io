      Here is a place to figure out the pronouns:<br>
      ya is you in english, but I in russian<br>
      the and they are righteously similar, but thee? thou? ты? - 3 лицо
      в одном случае, 2 в другом.<br>
      <br>
      он is probably one. one is someone. some one.<font color="#cccccc">
        (found in vol.12 where I lead this chapter from)</font><br>
      <br>
      ani is I in hebrew, but they in russian: они. <br>
      <font color="#cccccc">am and one? maybe, maybe not.</font><br>
      <br>
      Λ<br>
      &nbsp;I<br>
      V <br>
      <br>
      can be seen as <br>
      el, elle<br>
      I<br>
      Вы<br>
      <br>
      but, also as<br>
      delal (he, no anonymity here)<br>
      delai (you, anonymity here)<br>
      delau (I, anonymity here)<br>
      <br>
      This kind of anonymity between 1 and 2 persons reflects ya being
      you in english and I in russian.<br>
      I and V are both vowels, and both roman numerals too, btw. I is я,
      V is ю, and they go like эюя.<br>
      <br>
      thus<br>
      Λ<br>
      &nbsp;I<br>
      V <br>
      are not suffixes, but pronouns:<br>
      eL, a, ᛆ, 1<br>
      I я<br>
      V is post-T syllable or glyph or whatever, and 2nd person is the
      most fresh, probably because of this grammatic invention we had to
      move from duality to trinity.<br>
      <br>
      before we invented Вы, we used We. and thus и looking like u in
      cursive: <i>и &amp; u</i> is explained.<br>
      It was all: <br>
      Λ<br>
      V<br>
      arrow outside and arrow inside to show world (and people) outside
      or the person inside.<br>
      A of e of ex<br>
      V of в of in<br>
      E-ва слово того периода? вынь-сунь? о, это сексуальо<br>
      ебать таким образом вынь-сунь-ть, to вынь-сунь.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      wo (I (we)) in russian can be found in verbal suffix -u which
      indicates first person.<br>
      Then -i indicates second person, -ish indicates second person too,
      which is interesting, because not only I is first person in
      english, but also german ich is read as ish in bavaria. And that
      is another example of pronouns antonymy, especially because U is
      you in dutch, and in english u would be understood as you even
      though some modernist like joyce or welsh used y, which is related
      to u not only through greek Υ standing at the U's position, but
      also because russian у is u (and these phenomena are related, so
      no wonder, but that previous coincidence is wonderful indeed)<br>
      Suffix of the third person is -t (-et in singularis and -yut in
      pluralis, which is also yet to understand)<br>
      and it is pretty much universal: that is тот in russian, they can
      be translated as те.<br>
      <br>
      Some antonymity is present in te and ты, using for the second
      person the same т(t) we use for 3rd one.<br>
