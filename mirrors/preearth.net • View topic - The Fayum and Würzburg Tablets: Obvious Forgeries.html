			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">The following link provides a complete list of topics on this forum:</span><br><br><a href="http://www.preearth.net/phpBB3/search.php?search_id=newposts" class="postlink">http://www.preearth.net/phpBB3/search.php?search_id=newposts</a></span><br><br><span style="color: blue"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;">The Fayum and Würzburg Tablets: Obvious Forgeries.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: red">The
 story behind these tablets requires you to believe that around 800 BC, a
 scribe (obviously an apprentice) located in Fayum, Egypt, was given 
four copper (which in those days was as valuable as gold) tablets, each 
about 21 cm by 13 cm, on which to practice his writing skills. After an 
hour or so, the scribe completely filled the tablets with multiple 
copies of an early Greek alphabet, which he then discarded, or lost, in 
his garden. There they remained until discovered some 3000 years later, 
when it was observed that this alphabet was similar to other early Greek
 alphabets, but consisted of only the first 22 characters (from A to T),
 and was written retrograde, just like the Phoenician alphabet. If you 
believe this drivel, then I have a bridge to sell you. These copper 
tablets were clearly fabricated to "prove" that the Greek alphabet 
derives from the Phoenician alphabet. It is not clear why the fraudsters
 adopted such a transparently false cover story.</span><br><br>Below are a few passages (roughly translated) from Alfred Heubeck's article:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Die Würzburger Alphabettafel; The Würzburg Alphabet Tablet.</span><br><br>In
 1982, Mr. Alexander Kiseleff donated his collection of Egyptian and 
Greek antiquities to the Martin von Wagner Museum of the University of 
Würzburg. Of particular interest was the "alphabettafel" registered as 
Würzburg K 2064 (the Würzburg alphabet tablet).<br><br>Firstly, we 
emphasize that our remarks must remain piecemeal. Many questions remain 
open, above all because, nothing is known about the circumstances 
surrounding the discovery of our tablet, and because they have still not
 undergone any material analysis, and the patina and rust that largely 
cover them and render many characters unrecognizable, has not been 
removed.<br><br><span style="color: red">If the tablets were genuine the
 patina would have been removed to expose the form of all the 
characters. But the forgers have spent many years perfecting the art of 
producing a thick layer of green patina, and do not want it removed. 
Without the patina, people would more readily question the age of the 
tablets.</span><br><br>The Würzburg tablet is not alone; it has three 
companions which are confusingly similar in appearance and inscription, 
two of which are owned by the antiquarian H. P. Kraus, of New York and 
one owned privately.<br><br>The two New York tablets are referred to as 
The Fayum Tablets; their origin is said to be: Northern Egypt, 8 th 
century B.C. or earlier, are of size: 215 x 135 mm and 212 x 137 mm, and
 are continuously inscribed with ever new episodes of the alphabet from A
 to T on all four faces.<br><br><span style="color: red">It should be mentioned that no other Greek alphabets, even remotely like those of the tablets, have ever been found in Egypt.</span><br><br>The
 similarity of the Würzburg Tablet to the Fayum Tablets makes the 
assumption that all four tablets represent a set of equal provenance (in
 terms of location, time and production) hard to circumvent.<br><br><span style="color: red">Heubeck does not know where the Würzburg Tablet was "found" and has to deduce its origin from the Fayum Tablets.</span><br><br>The
 fact that the individual signs are of slightly changing style and size,
 that the distances between the lines are quite irregular, as are the 
distances between the individual signs, shows the lack of skills of the 
scribe.<br><br>The inexperience of the scribe is also shown by the following errors:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Side A:</span><br><br>line 2: right: the supplement is unsure, accidental repetition of 5-6 characters?<br>line 3: δγ is replaced by γδ.<br>line 10: ξ is replaced by η.<br>line 11: κ missing between ι and λ.<br>line 14: right: the supplement is uncertain; for 8 characters (μ - ρ) there is too little space.<br>line 18: left: the number of unreadable characters is uncertain (π - σ?).<br>line 19: right: the number of unreadable signs is uncertain (τ - γ?).<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Side B:</span><br><br>line 6: π is missing.<br>line 11: sade is missing.<br><br>Hard
 to explain is the use of the 4 holes punched at the corners of each 
tablet. In order to hang a tablet anywhere in any position, the two 
upper holes would have sufficed, and it is unlikely that a tablet would 
or should be tacked on four nails anywhere, given the double-sided 
inscription.<br><br>It seems even more hopeless to explain the 
strangeness which lies in the repeated repetition of one and the same 
series of letters on a single writing medium.<br><br><span style="color: red">There
 is a simple explanation; the tablets are forgeries. However, it seems 
even more hopeless to explain why the forgers expected such a stupid 
story to be believed.</span><br><br>Even a superficial comparison of the
 Etruscan-Greek alphabets with the Phoenician allows two important 
observations, namely, (a) that the Phoenician alphabet as well as our 
tablet ends with the sign taw or τ, while the other alphabets include υ 
and (some of) the so-called 'additional signs' φ, χ, ψ (and the 
relatively late ω), (b) that, in certain ways, the signs on our tablet 
are closer to the Greek letters than the Phoenician ones.<br><br><span style="color: red">Heubeck
 compares the forged alphabet on the tablet with other alphabets of the 
archaic period. See the table below. The columns represent:</span><br><br>(1) the Phoenician alphabet (with some variants), as commonly ascribed to the 8th/9th Century;<br>(2) the 'normalized' alphabet of the Würzburger Tablet;<br>(3) the Abecedarium of Marsigliana;<br>(4)
 the signs of the Euboian alphabet, as they have become known to us from
 the Nester cup of Ischia (right col.) Dating from 730-720, as well as 
some similar vessel fragments from the same island (left col.);<br>(5) the Abecedarium of Samos;<br>(6) the best preserved Abecedarium of Corinth.<br><br><span style="color: red">Heubeck points out the following features:</span><br><br><span style="color: red">[The numbers in parentheses, following each character, is the row number in the table.]</span><br><br>(1) The α (1) is formally closer to the later α than to the oldest Greek α (Ischia, Col. 4 left; Dipylon vase).<br><br><span style="color: red">In
 column 2 of the table, Heubeck presents a form of the character alpha 
quite different to that visible in the tablets (it appears to have been 
flipped horizontally and rotated 45 degrees). This has been done because
 the alpha drawn by Heubeck looks like it might have been derived 
directly from the Phoenician, while the alphas written on the tablet do 
not. This is simply to deceive the reader, to have him believe that the 
Greek alphabet originated from the Phoenician alphabet, without asking 
too many awkward questions.</span><br><br><img src="preearth.net%20%E2%80%A2%20View%20topic%20-%20The%20Fayum%20and%20W%C3%BCrzburg%20Tablets:%20Obvious%20Forgeries_files/deceptive-character-1.png" alt="Image"><br><br><span style="color: red">Heubeck's
 column 2 alpha (in row 1) is the first in the above diagram. The 
following alphas are copied from the tablets for comparison. For more on
 this, see below.</span><br><br>(2) The ζ (7) has the form I; It is 
noteworthy that one of the New York tables occasionally contains ζ in 
the later classical form Z, which is still missing in all archaic 
(Greek) alphabets.<br><br><span style="color: red">All archaic Greek 
alphabets use the symbol I for ζ. In the classical period the symbol Z 
was adopted. The fact that the Phoenician alphabet has from the earliest
 used both I and Z to represent the Phoenician zeta, proves that the 
Phoenician alphabet is derived from the Greek and is actually quite 
late. The tablets have been designed to deal with this "problem" by 
featuring Z in an very early Greek alphabet. It is all so easy when you 
can simply rewrite history by deception.</span><br><br>(3) The ι (10) is
 in all Greek alphabets without exact parallel; it has a certain 
resemblance to the Phoenician yod without being identical to it. Closer 
is the Phoenician Nun.<br><br><span style="color: red">The ι is 
different from all other Greek iotas as it is designed to be 
intermediate between the Greek iota and the Phoenician iota. All to 
convince you that the Greek alphabet derives from the Phoenician.</span><br><br>(4) The λ (12) is in form closer to the later λ than the earliest λ.<br><br>(5)
 The ν (14) has four dashes, while the Phoenician and all the Greek 
characters ν consist of only three dashes. The special form seems to 
stem from the desire to differentiate the ν from the three-dashed ι.<br><br><span style="color: red">(6)
 In column 2 of the table, Heubeck presents a form of the character san 
not representative of those visible in the tablets. Perhaps, Heubeck 
does not want you to notice that the san of the tablets is almost 
identical to the nu. Explaining the near identity of these two 
characters would be very difficult, so Heubeck tries to hide it away. If
 Heubeck was <span style="font-style: italic">"on the level",</span> he would have mentioned the character san here.</span><br><br><img src="preearth.net%20%E2%80%A2%20View%20topic%20-%20The%20Fayum%20and%20W%C3%BCrzburg%20Tablets:%20Obvious%20Forgeries_files/deceptive-character-2.png" alt="Image"><br><br><span style="color: red">Heubeck's
 column 2 san (in row 18) is the first in the above diagram. The 
following are copied from the tablets for comparison. For more on this 
deception of Heubeck's, see below.</span><br><br><span style="color: red">(7)</span> The σ (21) stands for the later ostion. σ closer than the oldest σ (Ischia, Marsigliana).<br><br><img src="preearth.net%20%E2%80%A2%20View%20topic%20-%20The%20Fayum%20and%20W%C3%BCrzburg%20Tablets:%20Obvious%20Forgeries_files/wurzburger-comparison.png" alt="Image"><br><br>Below are Heubeck's facsimiles of the Würzburg tablet.<br><br><img src="preearth.net%20%E2%80%A2%20View%20topic%20-%20The%20Fayum%20and%20W%C3%BCrzburg%20Tablets:%20Obvious%20Forgeries_files/wurzburger-alphabet-1.png" alt="Image"><br><br><img src="preearth.net%20%E2%80%A2%20View%20topic%20-%20The%20Fayum%20and%20W%C3%BCrzburg%20Tablets:%20Obvious%20Forgeries_files/wurzburger-alphabet-2.png" alt="Image"><br><br>Alfred Heubeck's article can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.preearth.net/pdfs/wurzburger-alphabet.pdf" class="postlink">here</a>.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Photos of the Fayum Tablets.</span><br><br><img src="preearth.net%20%E2%80%A2%20View%20topic%20-%20The%20Fayum%20and%20W%C3%BCrzburg%20Tablets:%20Obvious%20Forgeries_files/fayum-alphabet-1.png" alt="Image"><br><br><img src="preearth.net%20%E2%80%A2%20View%20topic%20-%20The%20Fayum%20and%20W%C3%BCrzburg%20Tablets:%20Obvious%20Forgeries_files/fayum-alphabet-2.png" alt="Image"><br><br>And a larger version.<br><br><img src="preearth.net%20%E2%80%A2%20View%20topic%20-%20The%20Fayum%20and%20W%C3%BCrzburg%20Tablets:%20Obvious%20Forgeries_files/fayum-alphabet-3.jpg" alt="Image"><br><br>To
 see that Heubeck's column 2 alpha (mentioned above as inaccurate) is

 see that Heubeck's column 2 san (mentioned above as inaccurate) is not 
representative of those visible on the tablet, it is necessary to view 
the photos (of the tablet), as Heubeck has deliberately drawn many of 
the san characters (of the facsimiles) incorrectly. In the following 
table I have compared each san character in the photos with the 
corresponding san character in the facsimiles. Column (2) gives the san 
characters from the photos. Column (1) gives Heubeck's representation of
 the letter. Column (3) is my representation.<br><br><img src="preearth.net%20%E2%80%A2%20View%20topic%20-%20The%20Fayum%20and%20W%C3%BCrzburg%20Tablets:%20Obvious%20Forgeries_files/san-from-wurzburger-tablets.jpg" alt="Image"><br><br>The following picture shows san characters from the Fayum Tablets.<br><br><img src="preearth.net%20%E2%80%A2%20View%20topic%20-%20The%20Fayum%20and%20W%C3%BCrzburg%20Tablets:%20Obvious%20Forgeries_files/san-from-fayum-tablets.jpg" alt="Image"><br><br>Another popular topic is:<br><br><a href="http://www.preearth.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=1175" class="postlink">There are no ancient Jewish cities in Israel, but there are lots of ancient Greek cities.</a></div>
