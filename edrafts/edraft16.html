              Yet it's hard to avoid this taboo when they teach us in
              universities
              that phoenician is the oldest alphabet, and then you
              recognize that
              it's structure is pure hebrew – the order is exactly the
              same and
              only graphic part differs. And we know that lLeEtTrRs are
              to come in
              many forms. And then you realize that alphabet go way
              beyond that: in
              ugaritic and even egyptian – and you don't want to write
              these
              words in majuscule as we russians don't initialize those
              letters. You
              don't want that because nationalism starts with splitting
              society in
              different groups by mere nationality principle. But divide
              et impera
              they say, and you want to imperare because the most of you
              just want
              a worm place and don't give a thing about language, your
              journals
              show that, boy they are boring, boy they lack logic, boy
              they are so
              self-righteous, but this grey-jacket form doesn't bring
              much
              authority – you could fool humans, but new specie appears
              on the
              stage, you cannot fool excelently adjusted logic of
              machine.
              Biologists are on the foremost frontier of the science and
              they
              recognized most of the peer-reviewed works in their field
              is trash,
              even unverifiable sometimes, mostly wrong, which sets a
              huge problem

              it's
              considered by wikipedia for example to be phoenician as
              well (though
              it's pretty much different from the phoenician as we know
              it) as if
              they prepare the basis of shifting the reality once again
              to their
              advantage - but I'm about to offer another way of dealing
              with this
              controversy. people are allowed to follow dogmas and
              plots, and their
              dogma is so savage only because it is ancient, which makes
              it a
              cultural heritage as well, so we should only be aware of
              the presence
              of different interest groups, but we should not seek
              revenge, because
              it's self-destructive, which is unreasonable when we have
              so many
              wonderful topics to focus ourselves on – and we welcome
              those
              wicked tricksters to join the common journey and stop
              worrying
              because there's no chance they're to keep their black
              books out of
