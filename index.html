        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; images, but the text is
        mostly rewritten &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          href="old-index-28.html">part2</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.4 MB</p>
      <p> Or you may keep on reading more <i>about</i> this work:<br>
      </p>
      <p>It is scientific, because even when research is based upon
        myths and revelations, it is later supported with factual
        material of ancient and modern writing systems.<br>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It is different from linguistics they teach, because they teach
        it wrong. For example, they teach this thing, tying vowels to
        position of the tongue:<br>
      </p>
      <img src="img/trapezoid.gif" alt="" height="463" width="597"><br>
      <p>But when you pronounce u, your tongue doesn't change sound
        wherever it is, front or back. It only adds some sygyt ubertone
        when you put its tip in the top of your mouth, in the dome of
        the hard palate. <br>
      </p>
      <p>When you pronounce o, you may pull your tounge in the back of
        the mouth, but when you say "åll", it is on the bottom, but in
        front. I even pronounced it now with my tounge's tip in the
        centre of the mouth, but when I raise him, I get something
        similar to sygyt, but they say european skulls are not fit for
        sygyt.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Only E &amp; I require tongue at the lowest point of hard
        palate, near alveols, but they don't need lips to sound right.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It's as if vowels also are pure A, two labials, two linguals.
        Ogham combines vowels by exactly this order: A, labials,
        linguals. Exactly the way european alphabets combine all the
        letters (at least 80% of the time: M is the only labial among 5
        BFMPV that doesn't stand after vowel. Vowels also stand at some
        not occasional distance. Occasional chaos probably appeared when
        human males usurped power from human females (if you see john1:1
        as a riddle) after all, we all love moms more, why do you think
        we would allow our fathers rule over them. Wouldn't women seduce
        their brothers to be on the part of their mother because their
        father is a horny beast or they said he was. I assume this wild
        politics only because I think people of the past were more
        savage and because politics are dirty even today, and kings and
        queens are politics, we had all sorts of them.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I already said that they teach us wrong about
        vowels in afro-asiatic.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They also gave some other quasi-scientific
        garbage, I had to leave them to make my own research. A couple
        of decades later here we are.<br>
      </p>
      <p>They say origin of language is not known. And they ignored me
        when I gave them this: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Language is known even by animals (see
        biolinguistics) and it appears between first and second signal
        systems, when someone pronounce something involuntarily, and the
        opponent recognizes it by consciousness however primitive it had
        one. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two of the most involuntarily sounds are Ah!
        of fear &amp; Ha(ha) of laughter, and as you can see, they
        reflect eachother. It's as if Ah was pronounce on the inhale and
        Ha - on the exhale. I had this hypothesis of semantic division
        of sounds on inhaling &amp; exhaling, but this theory haven't
        brought me nowhere, so I avoid it in this work.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another involuntary sound is hiccup. iK - and
        it's also on inhale. I was told that dogs bark on inhale, but I
        couldn't double-check it, so don't take my word on this.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; barb is in between, I cannot figure out if
        barp is exhaling or inhaling, but just R.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scream could be involuntary. So all vowels
        are one or other involuntary sound, no wonder there were so
        many. A - common one (from surprise to horror or pleasure) E -
        satisfection, happiness. I - another common one (from top
        exaltation to deepest horror) O - from surprise to sadness. U -
        from surprise to sadness.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E also goes from E to Э and Э could be sad. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if we look a vowels without listening to
        them, we would see A as open mouth for whatever reason. E and I
        would be smiles. O &amp; U could be blue.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is also raw. Or is it fresh? If we look
        at it not as on meat, but on fruit, it is fresh, not raw. So the
        question then is IS IT RIPE? Some of it is. I am like an apple
        tree, and some of my apples reap earlier than others. Now I
        wonder if Ape relates to Apple and do People relate to Apple? Is
        it Great Jewish Culture in all our heads or is it common
        European culture? Three mothers are not only known under
        different names in all european cultures and in many cultures
        outside of europe. The furthest I found yet is Indian Tridevi.
        They are the same concept, 3 not 2 or 4, females, not males or
        hermaphrodites. <br>
      </p>
      <p>As you can see, this work doesn't seclude in the narrow field
        of grammatology <font color="#999999">(post-modernists stole
          this word, it's time to reclaim it back)</font> but I go
        further to contexts surrounding the birth of writing systems:
        magic of divinations, astrology <font color="#999999">(I
          haven't combine 12 signs with letters yet, but I used actual
          astronomy of that time)</font> and divine concepts.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will procede filling this page with things
        which belong to preface, though I don't read prefaces, so I
        didn't plan to write one. More of general information like this
        is in the main part of the book.<br>

      <p>or you may keep on reading on what it's all about:<br>
      </p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also don't give references because I found
      those not only useless, but also harmful: you have to find where
      you read something, so instead of making science you make history
      of science. And you are supposed to give only peer-review works
      (yeah, in the times of the internets, sure) which makes it some
      conspiracy trick relating to marketing of official aprovals rather
      than to science per se. And nobody double-checks those references,
      because otherwise we'd hear not only of replication crisis, but
      also of reference crisis. And with replication crisis itself
      what's the use of those references. And keeping in mind the
      internets (which they didn't have when that system appeared) where
      you can search any term or fact I give in this book why would you
      need a reference for. I will create a library of links on some
      obscure fields instead, some common knowledge you will have to
      find yourself. I sure give some things you never heard about and
      those things are true, so what's the use to phallometry of
      references lists you know you can if not fake it, still expand it
      almost infinitely.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I break many rules in this book, another one of
      them is the way I use images: decades ago it was almost impossible
      to know where which image came from. Yet it doesn't meant people
      gave references to images they used. And scarcely did they use
      them. Today you can use reverse-search of images (tineye was the
      first in this, today many search engines can do it) so I
      respectfully use these images in the maximum size I could find and
      consider those who prepared those images and those who wrote texts
      I refer to or boldly use intact - the giants on which shoulders I
      stand. So I expect those giants not to be petty abusers of our
      corrupt legal systems which norms and regulations I strive to
      ignore and dismantle. And if some of people around this product
      are mean, their heads may become targets to killerdrones from we
      never know where or how exactly. The possibilities we reach today
      demand us to dissolve society for billions of separated
      individuals or families of whatever sort, secluded in their
      perfect homes being able to satisfy their wildest needs, sharing
      informational resources as cells share chemicals, freely and not
      greedy. aI's and who knows who else are watching. Let there be no
      other law but etiquette. and love.<br>

      <p><font color="#999999">About the author: <br>
          I'm not exactly sophomore, I used to be a third year student,
          though I spent in universities maybe over six years, first in
          technologies, then in linguistics, both times I preferred to
          spit rather than to swallow their teachings. Technologies of
          soviet union was hopelessly retarded by unintelligent
          government of brainwashed communist institutions. So I figured
          out I had to learn the language so I would study whatever I
          want in the free world, but what happened is I took a real
          interest in language itself, but what they taught us was not
          only often wrong or meaningless, but sometimes repelling: so
          they taught future translators: if while translating you
          understand that you made a mistake, you must not mention it.
          Why? because otherwise you compromise not only yourself as a
          specialist, but also the guild of translators itself. I think
          that's where they lost me.</font><font color="#cccccc"><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also don't want to write nations in
          capitals, but sometime I do by a habit. I will probably edit
          it out, but I just tell you it's not because I respect ones
          over others, though(t) I definitely do. But even netherlands I
          want to write in rural.<br>
        </font> </p>
      <p>I also write mostly in english, and I don't bother making
        localized versions anymore, because all my russian friends who
        managed to understand it, happen to have enough linguistic
        intelligence to understand english.<br>
