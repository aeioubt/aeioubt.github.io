      literally when Supermensch was the last word I wrote, my parallel
      interest have shown me this guy, all of the sudden wearing such a
      t-shirt:<br>

      and it would be nothing, just a coincidence if I didn't see
      something exactly like this just a day before:<br>
      <br>
      after I wrote "if they write чево as чего only to entangle that
      subject" I went on:<br>
      <div class="container" style="margin-top: 0px;" align="justify">and






        after I updated the site with that, I stumbled across<br>
        <p><b>Aegina</b> (<span class="nowrap"><span class="IPA nopopups

        <img src="apophenia_sometimes_files/Cover2014.jpg" alt=""
          height="800" align="right" width="391">It enforces my claim of
        θ being an invariant of φ but it also tells of that gСГⰃג
        playing its own game<br>
        g could be cj but it reads as d when read in russian cursive
        (cursive again, I didn't research it enough)<br>
        and thus c is a form of d? it makes sense for they both contain
        the grapheme of c, but Aegina standing for Ἀθηνᾶ which was also
        written as.. ATANA?<br>
        I read it at some linguistic conference, never cared to check if
        it's true, but looking for atana Ἀθηνᾶ here's the image I found
        the first. Г again, I'll keep it here until I can read greek,
        don't forget I write this book mostly for myself. but right now,
        is it really me who's writing it for myself?<br>
        <br>
        ATENA is the the way to write her name, not ATANA, <br>
        it's just my satanic tendencies envoke me to praise Satan. and
        Satanaya my colleague keeps on telling me about.<br>
        <br>
        And I don't even know if this poster relates to anything, for
        ΑΓΩΝ stands for STRUGGLE, and isn't Athena a goddess of war? I
        also thought it was wisdom. Wisdom, handicraft &amp; warfare.<br>
        αγωνα is match <font color="#cccccc">(or struggle too if I
          translate with google in rus) </font><br>
        <br>
        so I cut this piece out, but today that Superman made me bring
        this back together. Also because while I was looking for all
        this I found some interesting coins of Athena:<br>
        <br>

        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        but of course handicraft can do better:<br>
        <img

          alt="" height="787" width="1024"><br>
      </div>
      <p></p>
      Look at how it's written at the coin above, A θE as if it's two
      words, <br>
      as if it's θe as if it is general for fairy (fairy is фея in
      russian, <span title="" class="">

      P.S. I was watching that mathematical video because I thought I
      found where they've broken math, knowing of all those other
      scientific fields fulled with cognitive dissonances of some broken
      logical conclusions, I expected to see something of math deeper
      than x^0 = 1 and 0! = 1<br>
      so here's how I would go descending that rabbit hole:<br>
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCu_BNNI5x4<br>
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-I6XTVZXww<br>
      and here that guy telling where they're wrong, though I didn't get
      where, other than they're wrong:<br>
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuIIjLr6vUA<img

        alt="" height="494" align="right" width="350"><br>
      though his previous video on this topic seems to be more
      informative:<br>
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcKRGpMiVTw<br>
      I dare to say that mistake is earlier than they diverge, <br>
      1-1+1-1+1-1+... isn't 1/2 as this image is mere trolling: <br>
      but who am I to say their math is wrong,<br>
      they're mathematicians, and I deal linguistics, which is humanity,<br>
      and everybody knows that humanitarian mind is lack of math mind.<br>
      <br>
      If math refers digits, what is the name for what I'm doing? path?<br>
      Researching not digits, but letters.<br>
      <br>
      path ~ лаз? <br>
      p = п ~ л<br>
      p = r ~ л<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">нет, это разные автобусы (паз и лиаз)<font
          color="#ffffff"> не все эту шутку отцентят</font><br>
        <br>
        <font color="#000000">So I just leave it here, mostly for myself
          to make sense of that mathematical madness or to whistleblow
          the nonsense.</font> but later.<font color="#000000"><br>
        </font></font><br>
      But allow me to leave my brave guess here of why those paradoxes
      take place: <br>
      People avoid dividing by zero, but they're so easily manipulating
      with infinite series, which pretty much the same concept of
      dividing by zero.<br>
      <br>
      So when you just shift the serie by one position, isn't it like
      making elements of each position larger or smaller depending on
      where that serie go. Should I use "series" instead of "serie"? I
      apologize.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      1-1+1-1+1-1+... isn't 1/2 as this image is mere trolling: <br>
      it's whether 0 (when seen as (1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+...<br>
      or it can be 1 (when seen as 1+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+...<br>
      so they took the average number that sum never has. they cannot
      imagine infinity, I heard humans have this trouble. So they made
      some third calculation, and got 1/2 so they had two reasons to
      take this weird answer as solution to the approximation.<br>
      And after this tolerance all the system began to shatter, and it
      probably caused Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem, though I still
      didn't understand it, the <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4ndIDcDSGc">v</a>ideo
      explaining it is currently on the pause.<br>
      <br>
      So after such a deviant allowance of calculating the sum of a
      somewhat divirgent row, they came to that paradox, that
      1+2+3+4+5... -&gt; -1/12 and if string theory is based upon this,
      no wonder it hasn't been confirmed by a single experiment. <br>
