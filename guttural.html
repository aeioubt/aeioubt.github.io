      And though guttural don't exist in english, dutch goed <font
        color="#cccccc">(g is guttural)</font> is related to english
      good (g is velar), here I didn't know what guttural meant, beware
      that it happens sometimes, for I dig very wide field, I am
      occasionally misinformed here &amp; there, and I don't have an
      institution making fact-checking, yet. anyway, dutch g is not far
      from english h in hot, but h-kind has some other name, but I don't
      operate these terms yet, and I will show that ipa definitions are
      not only different from ones ancient linguists had, but also
      sometimes wrong, as I explain only in volume <a
        href="continuation.html">2</a> (ctrlF it for trapezoid) so r<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2zgB93KANE"><font
          color="#999999">å</font></a>w the structure of this book still
      is, I add this grey text here, after I'm past 769.4 kB of html
      alone in volume2.) <font color="#c0c0c0">or am I overcomplicating
        the matter? both variants were correct to the extent:<font
          size="+1"> </font></font><font color="#c0c0c0" size="+1">Guttural


        speech sounds are those with a primary place of articulation
        near the back of the oral cavity. In some definitions, this is
        restricted to pharyngeal consonants, but in others includes some
        velar and uvular consonants. Guttural sounds are typically
        consonants, but some vowels' articulations may also be
        considered guttural in nature.<br>
      </font>and being now in the bidst of volume3, I found this book:<br>
      Wadell, L.A.: 1927, The Aryan Origin of the Alphabet, Luzac &amp;
      Co, London <br>
      <a href="http://library.umac.mo/ebooks/b33333282.pdf">http://library.umac.mo/ebooks/b33333282.pdf</a>
      (<a
href="file:///home/mahead/aeiou-git/aeioubt.github.io/mirrors/b33333282.pdf">mirror</a>)<br>
      in which I found an incredibly interesting paragraph in Aryan
      Origins of Alphabet:<br>
      <i>It was long ago noticed that in the Phœnician, Greek and Latin
        or Roman alphabets there is a repeated sequence of the letters
        as vowels, labials, gutturals and dentals. This sequence is well
        displayed by Professor Petrie, in arranging the letters on a
        square table like the old "Horn-book" board for teaching
        children their ABC.</i><br>
      So they also called it guttural, even being published in english.
      So it looks like two different phonetic schools fighting with each
      other over this classification. And who knows how deep in the past
      they go.<br>
      (I just copied this piece from vol.3, it goes further and deeper
      there, though you're not recommended to read that far, though I
      felt like bringing this exact piece, because it's a masterpiece,
      an unique so far source speaking of this subject, and doing it as
      if everybody knows it "It was long ago noticed" duh)<br>
      <font color="#cccccc">good thing is I go much deeper, and that
        axial symmetry I explain position of Y &amp; Ω with seems to be
        unknown even more thoroughly. but of course I still want to see
        where it was noticed even longer ago. Sir Petrie was an
        egyptologist, and I suspect the roots of alphabet somewhere in
        Egypt (read about it further in this volume)</font><br>
