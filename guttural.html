      And though guttural don't exist in english, dutch goed <font
        color="#cccccc">(g is guttural)</font> is related to english
      good (g is velar), here I didn't know what guttural meant, beware
      that it happens sometimes, for I dig very wide field, I am
      occasionally misinformed here &amp; there, and I don't have an
      institution making fact-checking, yet. anyway, dutch g is not far
      from english h in hot, but h-kind has some other name, but I don't
      operate these terms yet, and I will show that ipa definitions are
      not only different from ones ancient linguists had, but also
      sometimes wrong, as I explain only in volume <a
        href="continuation.html">2</a> (ctrlF it for trapezoid) so r<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2zgB93KANE"><font
          color="#999999">Ã¥</font></a>w the structure of this book still
      is, I add this grey text here, after I'm past 769.4 kB of html
      alone in volume2.) <font color="#c0c0c0">or am I overcomplicating
        the matter? both variants were correct to the extent:<font
          size="+1"> </font></font><font color="#c0c0c0" size="+1">Guttural

        speech sounds are those with a primary place of articulation
        near the back of the oral cavity. In some definitions, this is
        restricted to pharyngeal consonants, but in others includes some
        velar and uvular consonants. Guttural sounds are typically
        consonants, but some vowels' articulations may also be
        considered guttural in nature.&nbsp;</font>
